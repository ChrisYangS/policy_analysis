        "name": "Retirement_Planning_Guidelines",
        "scope": "These guidelines apply to all permanent university staff.",
        "content": "General principlesA staff member may submit a request to retire according to the provisions in their employment agreement, where the staff member is clearly at the end of their career and is withdrawing permanently from substantial paid employment. Approval may be given in other circumstances by mutual agreement including retirement on medical grounds.Early planning for retirement is mutually beneficial in that it gives both staff and the University a more secure future, and enables both parties to plan with confidence.The University will provide guidance and support to staff wishing to plan for retirement, including an opportunity to explore options for managing a transition from full-time active service to retirement.The timing of retirement is a matter of individual choice, contractual notice period, and mutual agreement between the University and the staff member.Retirement planningIt is important that the disruption caused by the loss of expertise through retirement be minimised as much possible through early advice and planning. Some considerations in relation to succession planning within a Department, School and Division: Review the demographic profiles of staff to look for indicators or periods of change \u2013 e.g. is there a number of key staff where retirement within 3-5 years is likely?Are there any specific issues related to succession planning in a particular discipline or expertise?Are there staff with the appropriate capabilities and attributes available to fill key positions?What strategies are being developed or implemented to develop staff to fill key roles in the future?What are the characteristics of the future pool of academic staff (or other occupational groups) in particular disciplines - is it growing, shrinking, ageing or becoming younger? What are the inter-Divisional needs and options for inter-disciplinary collaborations?Are there strategies to attract, replace and retain future staffing in \u201cat risk\u201d areas? For example: retirement and phased retirement plans; professional development and mentoring programmes; building structured and supported career pathways; and flexible employment arrangements.Career planning discussions in performance review processes may include, where appropriate, retirement considerations. It may be appropriate to seek Human Resources advice.Staff are encouraged to plan and prepare actively for their retirement and to discuss their retirement plans with their HoD /Manager at an early stage. Information is available from Human Resources.Financial advice can only be provided by a registered Financial Advisor. The University is not qualified to provide financial advice. Regular financial planning seminars are provided by external advisors and staff are encouraged to attend.Retirement Seminars are provided and staff are encouraged to attend.SuperannuationThe University is party to a subsidised superannuation scheme \u2013 UniSaver \u2013 that eligible staff are encouraged to join. It includes a KiwiSaver Compliant version.Enrolment in a superannuation scheme does not occur automatically with the start of employment. Staff are required to apply to join a scheme.Note: Some staff are members of other schemes such as the Government Superannuation Fund which are no longer available to staff. Details can be viewed on the Human Resources website.RetirementStaff who wish to retire will ideally discuss this with their HoD /Manager in advance and must provide at least the minimum notice period required in their employment agreement. The staff member's notification of intention to retire must be made in writing to their HoD /Manager.Phased retirementPhased retirement may be granted where it is considered to be of benefit to the University as well as to the staff member.Phased retirement is formalised by a variation to the employment agreement. The variation must specify: FTE changes; the effective dates for each reduction; the retirement date; and the grade and step. If circumstances change, the variation may be varied by mutual agreement.Staff members on phased retirement will, within the constraints of a reduced FTE , be expected to continue to meet the normal range of duties for their role (e.g. a senior lecturer will continue to teach, conduct research and provide service appropriate for their role or a Service Representative Ask Otago will be available for rosters and tasks of the role within the FTE .) The HoD /Manager will consult with the staff member to determine the amount and type of duties expected.Staff intending to request phased retirement are recommended to consider the implications for their superannuation as some schemes have different criteria. Staff should seek appropriate advice from the scheme provider or Human Resources.A staff member who is eligible for a retirement gratuity will be paid the gratuity at the proportion they were employed at immediately prior to commencing the phased retirement. The phased retirement period will count towards the calculation of the payment.A participant will remain eligible for consideration for promotion and progression. Where a staff member is approaching their final retirement date their HoD /Manager may agree to waive a performance review.Office and/or laboratory space and other support services will be allocated using the appropriate considerations. These requirements will be negotiated when developing the provisions of the variation.Applying to retireAn employee considering retirement or phased retirement should discuss this with their HoD /Manager and other appropriate persons, well in advance of the formal request.The staff member will complete a form, either notifying of their retirement date, having taken into account the notice period in their employment agreement and their planning discussions with their HoD /Manager; orapplying to take phased retirement. If they are applying for phased retirement they will be required to provide the desired FTE (s), effective date(s) and duration of the phased retirement; the supporting reasons for the phased retirement; and implications for the role and the impact on their area of work.Approval processRequests for retirement that meet the provisions of the employment agreement and do not include a phased period, will be approved by the normal approver for that appointment level.The HoD /Manager will consult with the applicant and appropriate staff or HoD /Managers to evaluate requests in terms of planning, duration and FTE levels, personnel needs, costs, space and support requirements for the applicant and potential replacement (s), and other pertinent factors.Where phased retirement is requested, the HoD /Manager will make a recommendation to their Divisional Head via the appropriate approvers. The Divisional Head will review the proposed terms and the departmental recommendation, and consider the broader interests of the University. In some instances it may be appropriate to discuss the application with the Vice Chancellor. The Divisional Head will make the final decision.If the phased retirement is approved, the Retirement Application form will be sent to HR Services to draw up a formal variation of the terms of their employment. No agreement will be final until both parties have signed this variation.If the request for phased retirement is declined then the HoD /Manager will advise the employee and review the options if appropriate.",

        "content": "Sources of advice and relevant informationVisit the Recruitment and Selection Toolkit at the University's Human Resources website for guidance on the different steps of the selection process.Contact the University of Otago recruitment team at yourcareer@otago.ac.nz for further guidance and/or discussion on any recruitment topic.All academic appointments must adhere to University of Otago's policies and guidelines: Academic Titles GuidelinesConfirmation Path PolicyConflicts of Interest PolicyM\u0101ori Strategic FrameworkPacific Strategic Framework (PDF)Equal Employment Opportunity PolicyEquity and Diversity PolicyGood Employer PolicyAffirmative Action PolicyPromotions PolicyRemuneration PolicyAcademic Authority to Appoint Guidelines (PDF)Head of Department Recruitment Process GuidelinesTravel and Travel Related Costs PolicyT\u012b K\u014duka 2030: The Sustainability Strategic FrameworkSelection CriteriaInformation about the University's academic expectations and requirements can be found in the Guidelines for Academic Titles. This information should be used in conjunction with other related supporting policies or guidelines that apply to a particular position. For example, for positions that are categorised as Confirmation Path refer to the Confirmation Path Policy. Similarly for positions with promotion and/or salary progression options, the Academic Promotions webpage, Promotions Policy, M\u0101ori Strategic Framework and the Performance and Salary Review webpage would provide essential information.The information statement for candidates and the Guidelines for Academic Titles will determine selection criteria and interview programme.Principles to be adopted in the Selection CriteriaEquity and Diversity Appointments should be on merit: Merit is defined as giving preference to the person who is best suited to the position. This normally refers to the qualifications, experience and attributes required for any given position and are related to the information statement.Equity and Diversity: The University recognises that members of equity groups are more likely than others to experience barriers to achieving their full potential and/or to be underrepresented (M\u0101ori Strategic Framework and Equity and Diversity Policy).There must be no unlawful and inappropriate discrimination in the selection process. All panel members need to be aware of the risk of discrimination in the selection/appointment process, as this has both legal implications and consequences for the diversity of the University. The Equal Employment Opportunities Policy and the Ethical Behaviour Policy outline what constitutes discrimination.Panel members are asked to be aware of unconscious bias and to focus solely on the criteria outlined in the selection criteria. Unconscious bias happens automatically and is triggered by our brain making quick judgments and assessments of people and situations, influenced by our background, cultural environment and personal experiences. Irrespective of how fair minded we consider ourselves to be, most people have some degree of unconscious bias. The University of Otago makes every effort to eliminate the effects of unconscious bias in its selection process.  Panel members are asked to find out about their own unconscious bias:Visit the Project Implicit websiteFind out more about the effects of unconscious bias in this short videoPanel members must also become familiar with, and adhere to, the University's Equal Employment Opportunities, Good Employer and Affirmative Action policies.Confidentiality and privacy The privacy of candidates will be respected throughout the selection process. Candidate information (including CVs) should be circulated only to the selection panel.If it is deemed appropriate for a wider review of CVs (beyond the panel), the Chair will determine the most appropriate method, taking into account applicant privacy and the most effective method of collating feedback. Please refer to Section 4 (h) (Role of the Head of Department and Chair) for further details.Any intention to share CVs beyond the selection panel should be made explicit to the candidates.To ensure confidentiality, no member of the panel may report the views of any other member or what transpired in the course of the panels' deliberations, or release outside of the panel any information relating to applicants in the recruitment process.The University is seeking to attract and hire the best candidates: it is important candidates have confidence and trust in our recruitment process and the care of their personal information.It is the role of the Chair to communicate with candidates. Panel members must not speak to candidates about the process: this includes speaking about other candidates, or providing them with information about the process that is underway. It is the role of the Chair to communicate with applicants and to ensure any other communication is appropriate.The Chair has overall responsibility to ensure that privacy and confidentiality is maintained.Conflict of Interest Members of the selection panel should declare any conflict of interest to the Chair before the shortlisting and interview process begins. The Chair will decide if it is appropriate for the panel member to be part of the selection process. If they continue in the selection process, the panel should be made aware of the situation and the conflict of interest should be managed. Please refer to the Conflicts of Interest Policy or contact the Recruitment team for further guidance when the situation arises. If the Chair has a conflict of interest, please contact the Recruitment team for guidance.Role of the Head of Department and ChairWhilst the Head of Department (HoD) is usually the Chair, in some circumstances the HoD will appoint a Chair.The HoD will ensure that appropriate approvals are sought for the advert and panel membership. Refer to:Academic Authority to appoint Guidelines (PDF)Screening/Pre-selection: The Chair shall convene a panel to undertake screening of applicants (including a longlisting process) in order to arrive at a shortlist of candidates suitable for interviewing.Panel: The panel would normally comprise the Chair, the PVC/Dean (or nominated senior academic leader) and at least two other academic staff members. This could include a member of staff from the Department or a member of academic staff from the wider University. An HR/Recruitment team representative can be included as part of the panel if appropriate. When selecting the panel, the Chair will consider the strategic focus, expertise required, and the need to consult with relevant stakeholders or interested groups. Careful consideration should be given to selecting a diverse panel.Senior appointment considerations: The process for senior level appointments (i.e. Associate Professor and above) is similar to that for making other academic appointments except that approval for appointments rests, at Associate Professor, with the Staffing Advisory Committee, and for Professor appointments, the Vice-Chancellor. The information for candidates' statement for senior level appointments needs to follow an approved format and should be coordinated through the Recruitment team.The Chair is responsible for ensuring the selection process is appropriate for the position: fair, equitable and designed to clearly identify the most suitable candidates. This will include: Ensuring candidate enquiries are dealt with appropriately.Facilitating the shortlisting process and recording the reasons for decisions.Managing the interview programme and assigning topics to be covered by each panel member during the interview.Welcoming the candidate and introducing all the members of the panel.Facilitating questioning, ensuring continuity and time management.Recording and summarising initial panel feedback.Facilitating the decision making process and ensuring every effort is made to reach a unanimous decision.Recording final panel decisions and ensuring that records of recruitment decisions, including shortlisting and interview notes, are stored securely for 12 months then confidentially destroyed after this period.The interview programme for an academic position will typically include an interview, presentation of a formal research seminar to staff of the Department and invited guests, a teaching demonstration, and a programme of informal activities.The Chair will determine the most appropriate method for academic staff to view CVs of those shortlisted applicants who have accepted an invitation to participate in the interview programme. This will take into account candidate privacy and the most effective method of collating feedback. Ideally CVs will be available to view in a secure location, soft copies should not be circulated. Other application details, including the application forms, covering letters and references remain confidential to the panel. Please refer to Section 3 (b)(ii)(iii) (Confidentiality and privacy) for further details.Academic staff may provide written feedback to the Chair. Feedback will be invited during the interview programme \u2013 there will be a reasonable deadline, to allow for both reflection and to keep the recruitment process progressing efficiently. Written feedback will be submitted in confidence, summarised into a single document and be relevant to the selection criteria (as outlined in the information statement) of the vacancy. The Chair will collate and circulate feedback to the panel for consideration.At the conclusion of the selection process the Chair will also seek approval for the appointment of the recommended candidate in accordance with the University's specified appointment delegations. For further information, please refer to:Academic Authority to Appoint Guidelines (PDF)In recommending an appointment, the Chair (with support from the panel) will submit a brief statement explaining why the candidate selected is the most suitable appointee in terms of the field of the job as advertised, the selection criteria, the applicant's research record, teaching experience, and qualifications. This will include recommendation of the appointment level relative to the levels in the Department as evidenced by promotion outcomes for that Department/School.For advice on providing feedback to unsuccessful candidates, please contact Human Resources.Other considerationsCandidate impression of the University: remember that candidates are also assessing us as a potential employer, and their impressions of the University and the Department will have an impact on their decision making. All applicants will be evaluating: The University as a potential employer.The research profile of the Department.Facilities relevant to the candidate's teaching and research, such as laboratories and seminar spaces.The region as a place to live for themselves and any family.Department staff and other academics in the University as colleagues and potential research collaborators.Reference checking: depending on the role and preference of the Chair, reference checking can take place prior to shortlisting, or later in the process. The common format calls for written references from three to four referees. It can help to specify to referees what aspects of candidate's performance the panel would like them to comment on when requesting the reference, and a deadline for response.Video Conference / Telephone Interviews: When all or some of the shortlisted applicants are based elsewhere, the Chair may choose to conduct short interviews via telephone or video conferencing technology (e.g. ZOOM), with all shortlisted applicants, prior to bringing applicants to the Campus for the formal interview programme. The aim of the initial video interviews is to determine candidates' motivation for their application and to clarify various aspects from their application to assist the panel with their decision-making.Campus visits for shortlisted candidates: when arranging for a candidate to visit the campus, considerations should be given to the following arrangements: Organise travel and suitable accommodation (wherever possible, pay for travel arrangements rather than reimbursing the applicant). Please refer to the Travel and Travel Related Costs Policy for more details.As a minimum, ensure transport to and from the airport has been organised. Ideally, it would be most welcoming to have the applicant met by the Head of the Department (or nominee). This is particularly important for any applicants travelling internationally to attend the interview programme.Always check with applicants for any specific travel requirements, for example dietary and disability requirements or other reasonable accommodation for travel arrangements.Provide applicants with relevant information in preparation for their visit in the form of a letter of welcome, confirming the day and time of the visit, travel and accommodation arrangements, list of expenses that are reimbursable and contact information.An itinerary for the visit including a complete schedule of events/interview programme and the names and titles of individuals they will meet. Include any social events and any dress code.Ensure there is space in the itinerary for the candidate to have some free time to relax \u2013 particularly if they may be affected by jet lag.For all applicants who will need to relocate, ensure a meeting with a University of Otago relocation and settlement support specialist is scheduled as part of the interview programme.Provide the opportunity for applicants to request any equipment/IT requirements and any accessibility related requirements they may need.Internal or local applicants should be extended comparable courtesies as external applicants e.g. information provided, invitations to social events and access to equipment/IT support.Care should be taken to ensure the interview programme is equitable e.g. wherever practicable ensuring the same composition of guests at any informal events.Any staff contributing to the selection process should be made aware of the importance of objectivity. For example, attending all candidate seminars or none at all.",

        "content": "1. Introduction\nThe appointment of suitably qualified, experienced, and independent thesis examiners is a critical element of the examination processes for graduate research degrees at any University. Independence of examiners is an important quality indicator of an institution\u2019s examination process, ensuring that examination is undertaken independently and is free of bias.A conflict of interest exists where a potential examiner has worked with the candidate on matters directly related to the thesis research. To ensure independence of the examination process, an examiner should not be nominated if there is the potential for actual or perceived conflict of interest with: the student;the supervisory team;the University;subject matter; orwith other members of the Examination panel, including the Convener.\n2. Nomination of Examiners\nThe nomination of examiners is made by the supervisory team and subsequently formally approved by the Head of School or Department. Management of conflicts of interest is primarily the responsibility of the supervisory team, using these guidelines as an initial reference. Any questions or issues related to actual or potential conflicts of interest should be raised with the relevant Dean of Head of Department in the first instance, and discussed with the Dean of the Graduate Research School as appropriate.While there is no presumption that any individual will behave inappropriately, it is not reasonable for potential examiners to make decisions about their suitability to examine (with reference to these or other guidelines). However, it is reasonable to expect examiners to declare conflicts of interest and to note these as appropriate.No conflict of interest exists in situations where a candidate attends a conference organised by a potential examiner, has informal contact with a potential examiner at conferences or workshops etc., or presents papers in a department at which a potential examiner works, or submits papers to a journal edited by a potential examiner.There is a range of circumstances which have the potential to introduce bias and compromise the independence of the examination. In dealing with potential conflicts of interest it is important to: Distinguish between major conflicts (as outlined below) which generally preclude appointment of the examiner, and minor conflicts (as outlined below) which should be declared and explained, but do not necessarily inhibit the examiner\u2019s independence; andConsider disciplinary and/or cultural factors which may arise from smaller departments or small fields/communities of study that might alleviate perceived conflicts of interest (as outlined below)In situations where there is a relatively small community of researchers (e.g., M\u0101ori or Pacifica, or area of expertise), there is a higher likelihood of a personal or professional relationship such as through network associations, research grants or publication outputs. In some instances, there may be a previous supervisory and/or examination relationship between the examiner and candidate or supervisor. In each case there may be mitigating circumstances, and it is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure there is full disclosure of the nature of the relationship to the Dean of the Graduate Research School to consider exceptional cases for approval. This process is essential to ensure the integrity and transparency of the nomination process.There may be challenges in balancing the need to find an independent examiner and the need to find an examiner with focal expertise in the field of the thesis. However, it should be noted that specific expertise within the narrow field of the thesis is not the only (nor necessarily the primary) consideration in selecting a potential examiner. An examiner\u2019s broad knowledge of the particular field of research, experience as a supervisor and as an examiner of research degree candidates, plus their broad familiarity with the expectations of the research degree (and the thesis) are all equally important considerations in the selection and nomination of examiners.\n3. Major Conflicts of Interest\nListed below are examples of different types of major conflicts of interest that may arise between the examiner and various parties including the candidate, the supervisor/advisor, the University, the subject matter itself, and another member of the examination panel (including the Convener).  It should be noted that the following list is only indicative of major conflicts of interest and should not be considered exhaustive. Conflicts with the CandidateWorking relationshipsExaminer has co-authored a paper with the candidate within the last five yearsExaminer has worked with the candidate on matters regarding the thesis (e.g., as an advisory team)Examiner has employed the candidate or been employed by the candidate within the last five yearsExaminer is in negotiation to directly employ or be employed by the candidateExaminer has acted as a referee for the candidate for employmentExaminer has held a grant with the candidate within the last five yearsPersonal and wh\u0101nau relationshipsExaminer is or was married to the candidateExaminer is a known relative of the candidate (e.g., member of their immediate wh\u0101nau)Examiner is legally family to the candidate (e.g., stepfather, sister-in-law)Examiner and the candidate have an existing or a previous emotional relationship, are co-residents, or are members of a common householdExaminer is a friend, associate or mentor of the candidateExaminer is either a legal guardian or dependent of the candidate or has power of attorney for the candidateExaminer is in a social relationship with the candidate, such as co-Trustees of a Will or godparentBusiness, professional and/or social relationshipsExaminer is currently in or has had a business relationship with the candidate in the last five years (e.g., partner in a small business).Conflicts with the Supervisor/AdvisorWorking relationshipsExaminer was a candidate of the supervisor within the past five yearsExaminer has co-supervised with the supervisor in the past five yearsExaminer holds a patent with the supervisor which is still in forceExaminer had directly employed or was employed by the supervisor in the past five yearsExaminer is in negotiation to directly employ or be employed by the supervisorExaminer has co-authored a publication with the supervisor in the past five yearsExaminer has held a grant with the supervisor within the last five years.Personal and wh\u0101nau relationshipsExaminer is or was married to the supervisorExaminer is a known relative of the supervisor (e.g., member of their immediate wh\u0101nau)Examiner is legally family to the supervisor (e.g., stepfather, sister-in-law)Examiner and the supervisor have an existing or a previous emotional relationship are co-residents, or are members of a common householdExaminer is a friend, associate, or mentor of the supervisorExaminer is either a legal guardian or dependent of the supervisor or has power of attorney for the supervisorExaminer is in a social relationship with the supervisor, such as co-Trustees of a Will or godparentBusiness, professional and/or social relationshipsExaminer is currently in or has had a business relationship with the supervisor in the last five years (e.g., partner in a small business)Conflicts with the University Working relationshipsExaminer is currently in negotiation with the University for a work contract (other than examining theses)Examiner has/had a formal grievance with the UniversityConflicts with the Subject Matter Examiner has a direct commercial interest in the outcomes of the researchConflicts with Other Examiners Working relationshipsExaminer works in the same department/school as another examinerPersonal relationshipsExaminer is married to, closely related to, or has a close personal relationship with another examiner\n4. Minor Conflicts of Interest\nListed below are examples of different types of minor conflicts of interest that may arise between the examiner and various parties including the candidate, the supervisor/advisor, the University, the subject matter itself, and another member of the examination panel (including the Convener). It should be noted that the following list is only indicative of minor conflicts of interest and should notbe considered exhaustive. \nExaminer has had personal contact with the candidate that may give rise to the perception that the examiner may be dealing with the candidate in a less than objective mannerExaminer has a current professional relationship, such as shared membership of a Board or Committee (including editorial and grant decision boards), with the supervisorExaminer has examined for the University three or more times in the past 12 months and/or five or more times in the past five yearsExaminer has received an Honorary Doctorate from the University within the past five yearsExaminer graduated from the University within the past five yearsExaminer is currently working for the University pro bono (for example, on a review)Examiner has a current professional relationship with the University (for example, membership of a Board or Committee)Examiner has a currently Visiting position with the University or has had such a position during the candidature of the candidate or in the past five yearsExaminer has a professional relationship with another examiner",

However, it's worth noting that the provided data does not explicitly mention cross-references, but rather provides examples of potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe following sections could be considered as containing unnecessary content or repetition:\n\n1. Section 4. Minor Conflicts of Interest: The section lists minor conflicts of interest, which seems to be a repetition of some points mentioned in Section 3 (Major Conflicts of Interest). Removing or consolidating this information might help streamline the policy.\n\n2. Lack of clear references to other policies: There are several instances where the policy document mentions \"these guidelines\" without providing a clear reference to another specific policy document. For instance, when discussing the supervisor's relationship with the examiner, it says \"Examiner and the supervisor have an existing or a previous emotional relationship, are co-residents, or are members of a common household.\" It would be beneficial to specify which guidelines or policies this refers to.\n\n3. Repetitive language: Some sections use repetitive language, such as when discussing business, professional, and social relationships. This repetition might make the policy more difficult to read and understand.\n\n4. Lack of clear categorization: The policy document uses different categories (e.g., Major Conflicts of Interest, Minor Conflicts of Interest) without providing a clear explanation or context for why these distinctions were made.

        "content": "IntroductionThe University of Otago welcomes sponsorships and other forms of support from alumni and friends of the University, individuals, corporations, major trusts and foundations. Such support is a vital addition to Government funding and income received from tuition fees.The University is committed to the highest standards of accountability regarding the provisions of any sponsorship agreement, including the stewardship of sponsors and any agreed benefits.Staff responsibilitiesBefore sponsorship developmentOne of the primary purposes of the University is to protect the freedom of staff and students to question and test conventional wisdom in a manner that is thoughtful, prudent, and respectful. To ensure that all forms of incoming sponsorship are consistent with this principle, they must: Not compromise the University's fundamental principles of integrity, autonomy and academic freedom.Adhere to the following principles outlined in the University's Treasury Management Policy: The University has a commitment to ethical and socially responsible investing. Therefore, any equity and bond investment made must consider social good as well as financial return.The University should not invest directly in companies that are primarily involved in the production or distribution of alcohol, tobacco or munitions, or in the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. A measured approach should be taken with materiality issues considered.Not expect the University to provide inappropriate consideration to the sponsor or anyone designated by the sponsor, such as employment in the University, enrolment in a University course of study, or a University procurement contract.Not accept sponsorships that involve unlawful discrimination, or involve terms and conditions contrary to the University's Equal Educational Opportunities Policy or Equal Employment Opportunities Policy, or promote causes that are deemed to be contrary to the interests of the University.Align to the University's commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi, guiding principles and strategic objectives.Be in accordance with all relevant University policies.It is the responsibility of the staff member seeking to initiate a sponsorship to ensure that the sponsorship complies with these requirements. This responsibility includes gaining an understanding of these guidelines and seeking support from the relevant department(s), such as the Development and Alumni Relations Office (see below), where appropriate.Managing the sponsorshipIf the above requirements are met and the sponsorship proceeds, the following rules apply: Naming rights associated with sponsorship will be determined in accordance with the University's Naming Rights Policy.Promotional use of sponsors' corporate logos and colours may be included in printed materials and content, including online content. However, corporate identification and logos should always be displayed secondary in size and position to the University's branding.All use of the University's logo by the sponsor must be approved by Marketing Services.The Incoming Sponsorship Guidelines will be provided to sponsors in the course of negotiations concerning formal agreements, and the Policies and Guidelines referred to herein will be referenced in agreements as appropriate.Sponsors may not use the University's communications as a direct sales channel for their products or services.Staff members must comply with the University's Conflict of Interest Policy.Staff and sponsors should be aware that sponsorships attract GST and is deducted from the total sponsorship amount. In-kind sponsorship is also liable for GST .The University does not accept responsibility for ensuring that sponsorship agreements entitle the sponsor to tax deductibility.University funds that are made available from time to time to supplement sponsorship funding will be allocated in accordance with established budgetary procedures.The terms and conditions governing the use of sponsorship funding are matters of public record, except for information that is confidential or proprietary.Sponsorships over $2,500The Director of Development and Alumni Relations must be informed of and approve all intended approaches at or above $2,500 before any sponsorship request is developed (refer to the definition of Development under Definitions in this document).Sponsorships under $2,500Sponsorship opportunities amounting to less than $2,500 may be developed and advanced without the approval of the Director of Development and Alumni Relations Office (DARO). DARO staff can provide guidance or support to staff with these sponsorships where time and resources permit.DARO responsibilitiesThe Development and Alumni Relations Office is responsible for: Providing strategic management of meaningful philanthropic and sponsorship relationships with the University.Developing sponsorship proposals for approved University projects or areas valued at or above $2,500.Obtaining feedback from the Communications Office and Marketing Services on potential sponsorship deliverables for sponsorships valued at or above $2,500.Ensuring required sponsorship deliverables are fulfilled for sponsorships valued at or above $2,500.Co\u2011ordinating and providing formal reports to sponsors for all sponsorships valued at or above $2,500, and for ensuring that these reports conform to University policy.Assisting the Vice-Chancellor in advising the University Council on a quarterly basis of all sponsorship agreements of $50,000 and above.Providing advice to staff on sponsorship development, where appropriate.",

Without more context, it's difficult to determine whether this reference constitutes \"unnecessary\" content.\n\nIf I had to suggest an alternative, I would propose removing the \"(see below)\" phrase and instead providing a clear explanation or guidance on where staff members should direct their inquiries for further support.

This would reduce unnecessary complexity in the document.\n\nThe other issue I noticed is that there's a subtle distinction between policies and procedures. The section \"The terms and conditions governing the use of sponsorship funding are matters of public record, except for information that is confidential or proprietary\" could be considered more as a procedure than a policy. However, this is not necessarily a structural flaw, but rather a matter of categorization.\n\n2. None other policies have been found to have significant inconsistencies or structural flaws.",

This distinction could help in categorizing policies more accurately.\n\n3.  **Lack of Clear Categorization**: There seems to be a lack of clear categorization between policies and procedures within the document. While some sections may fit into both categories, providing clear labels or instructions would help staff members understand their responsibilities and ensure compliance with university policies.\n\n4.  **Repetition of Similar Information**: Some sections contain similar information about sponsorship guidelines, such as \"Staff responsibilities\" and \"Managing the sponsorship\". While this repetition might seem intentional for emphasis, it could be condensed to reduce unnecessary complexity in the document.\n\n5.  **Inconsistent Thresholds**: The threshold for Director of Development and Alumni Relations (DARO) approval varies between $2,500 and no specific dollar amount is mentioned for sponsorships under that amount. It would be beneficial to establish a clear threshold or range for DARO involvement.\n\n6.  **Lack of Standardized Reporting Requirements**: While the document outlines specific requirements for sponsors over $2,500, such as formal reports to be provided by DARO, it does not specify standardized reporting requirements for lower-value sponsorships. Establishing these standards would help maintain consistency and transparency in sponsorship agreements.\n\n7.  **Unclear Sponsorship Deliverables**: The section \"Promotional use of sponsors' corporate logos and colours may be included in printed materials and content\" could be clarified with specific guidelines on acceptable promotional practices, such as branding requirements or restrictions on sponsored content.\n\nBy addressing these points, the policy document can become more concise, clear, and effective in guiding staff members through the sponsorship process while ensuring compliance with university policies.",

The agreement must always be accompanied by Terms and Conditions and the Employment Relationship Problem Resolution Process document.\nThe Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement allows payments to be made by submitting casual timesheets/payments requests as required. In situations where only one payment is appropriate (agreed fee, lump sum, few days work), Section F \u201cSingle payment Request\u201d can be used.\nBack to Index\n3. Time Limits and Renewals of Casual Employment\nPlease note that an agreement undertaken on this basis does not constitute a guarantee that work will be available to the employee during this period, and care should be taken that this is clearly understood. \nAll casual agreements must contain a finish date. Employees must not under any circumstances be allowed to work beyond the finish date of their written agreement. Agreements must always be signed by both parties before work commences in the position.For advice on the appropriate type of agreement and appointment procedure, please contact your Divisional Human Resources Manager or Payroll Services.Separate Agreements Required for each Position Where staff work in more than one casual job, a separate Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement is required for each different casual job entered into, i.e. jobs in different Departments or at different pay rates or involving completely different types of work.Staff employed by the University as general or academic staff on a permanent or longer fixed-term basis, and who undertake casual work in a completely separate position to their normal job that does not compromise their existing work commitments, must also have a casual employment agreement completed, in addition to Casual Staff Timesheet/Payment Requests. Where this occurs the Department's HOD/Manager should first discuss this with the Divisional Human Resources Manager.\nBack to Index\n4. Casual Staff Pay Rates\na. Rates from Established University Scales\nThe responsibility for offering casual staff employment agreements and pay rates has been devolved to Heads of Department, where the pay rate falls on the University's established pay scales. When deciding on a particular pay rate, please note the following points:\nConsult the appropriate University salary scales, notes and remuneration policy. Casual staff members must normally be paid on an hourly rate from the University's current scales. In the case of general staff positions paid on scale 1 the salary may not be above the midpoint of the appropriate level without prior approval from the Human Resources Division.Be aware of the precedent created by employing a casual staff member on a particular hourly rate. Should that person be successful in obtaining permanent employment of a similar nature at the University, they will expect a similar rate of pay. To avoid the problems that this may cause, the same remuneration policy that is used when employing permanent staff should be applied.\nb. Holiday Pay\nStaff employed on the Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement will receive 8% holiday pay as they go.\nFor budgetary purposes, allow for this 8% holiday pay and for 0.53% for the ACC Employer Levy. However, when advising casual staff of hourly rates, the holiday pay and ACC Employer Levy should not be included in the rate quoted.\nc. Off Scale Special Rates or Agreed Fees\nThe University scales are to be used where there is a specific University rate which applies to the type of work to be performed. In special employment circumstances, special rates of pay not derived from the University pay scales may need to be used for one-off employment situations. Special rates may involve a fixed sum for the work, agreed fee, or a payment per session.\nThe use of off-scale special rates of pay and agreed fees requires Divisional approval. Divisional Heads may delegate their authority to one other person in the Divisional Office. In this event, the guidelines for the delegation should be clear including clarification over the circumstances that the Divisional Head should be consulted in a decision. Human Resources/Payroll Services are to be advised in writing of any such approved delegations.\nIn seeking Divisional approval for special rates, a full justification for the proposed rate must be provided, including an indication of the estimated time involved in completing the work, the rate the calculation is based upon and any market factors involved. The approved signatory should clearly sign each contract*.\nIn establishing agreed rates for single payments, it must be borne in mind that the final payment must not equate to less than the legal minimum wage. Please note: The University applies the adult minimum wage to all employees 16 years and over as defined by the New Zealand government.\nAll enquiries regarding casual pay rates should be made to the Divisional or School Office in the first instance and thereafter to the Human Resources Division or Payroll Services.\n* Once an Agreed rate for special work has been established, (between the Division and Human Resources), it can then be used for future payments to that employee, and other employees doing the same job, without getting divisional approval each time. A copy of this agreed rate would be held by Human Resources/Payroll Services\u00a0\u00a0\nd. Public Holidays\nIn general, casual staff are not normally paid for Public holidays unless they have been required to work on the day concerned.\nPayment will only be made for a Public Holiday not worked, where it falls on a day the employee would normally have worked under an established pattern of work.\nWhere the Employee is required to work on a Public Holiday, the Employee will be paid normal pay for time actually worked plus half as much again, if the day is a day the Employee would normally have worked under an established pattern of work, they will receive an alternative holiday as provided in the Holidays Act 2003.\nIf any of these situations apply and the staff member is to be paid for a Public Holiday, please indicate this clearly on the timesheet.\ne. Hours of work\nWork in excess of 37.5 hours per week, or 40 hours for trades type positions, should generally not be worked by casual staff, and may not be worked without prior authorisation by the Supervisor or Manager. Any work in excess of 37.5 hours per week carried out under a casual agreement will be paid at the ordinary hourly rate. It is important that casual staff are provided with the appropriate breaks.\nBack to Index\n5. Time Sheets/Payment Requests\nActual working time should be recorded on individual timesheets/payment requests. Lunch breaks are not paid time but tea breaks are. Payroll Services must have received the original completed Standard Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement, the completed IR330 and (if applicable) the completed Casual Staff Timesheet/Payment Request before they can process a casual payment.\na. Time sheet Submission Deadline\nEach timesheet/payment request must be received by Payroll Services at the very latest of 12 noon on the Thursday prior to the end of a fortnightly pay period. Timesheets/payment requests received after this time, or where details have been incorrectly completed or insufficient information has been provided, will not be processed for the particular pay period.\nFor staff already employed in another position for which they are paid monthly, the deadlines for timesheets will differ. Please contact Payroll Services to ascertain the correct dates.\nPay will be direct credited to the staff member's bank account.\nb. Signing Authority for Timesheets\nHeads of Department may delegate authority for signing of timesheets to a Departmental Administrator, or other designated person in their Department. Where such a delegation is made, formal advice from the Head of Department must be forwarded to Payroll Services, stating the nature and extent of the delegation, along with the name, position and a sample signature of the designated person. The casual staff employment agreement form has a line for the details of an alternative person to be entered, who may authorise timesheets for that particular agreement (for example a research grant holder). Only staff members who hold formal delegated authority, may sign timesheets, and Heads of Department must ensure that all staff are aware of the limits of their authority, and that staff do not act outside of such limits.\nBack to Index\n6. Legal Requirements\nAll staff to whom the University offers employment, including casual staff, are required to have been: Given a written employment agreementGiven a description of the work to be performedAdvised of the reason for the fixed-term (which includes casual) nature of their appointmentAdvised of when their term of appointment will endGiven an indication of where the work is to be performedGiven an indication of the arrangements relating to the times the staff member is to workInformed of the wages payableProvided with a plain language explanation of the services available for the resolution of employment relationship problemsAdvised of their right to seek independent advice about the intended employment agreementGiven a reasonable opportunity to seek that independent adviceGiven appropriate tea breaks\nBack to Index\nNOTE: The University is required to keep copies of all documentation, including timesheets, for a period of seven years under the Employment Relations Act 2000.

Supervisors should advise on the form, arrangement, focus and length of the thesis, as well as providing advice on the suitability of the language and illustrations used in the thesis. Rather than using extensive track changes, supervisors should use comments and margin notes.

Summary\nThe University seeks to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for all staff and students.For new buildings and major redevelopments, the University's Facility Standards will be used to ensure thermal comfort.For existing buildings, it will not always be possible to meet the desired level of comfort due to the limitations of the building. In those cases the University will endeavour to provide the best thermal comfort that can practically be achieved.\n2. Target level of thermal comfort\nThe target level of thermal comfort that will allow most people doing sedentary work to be comfortable while wearing appropriate clothing for the season is: Target Levels of Thermal ComfortConditionSummerWinter Air temperature\n          18-24\u00b0C\n         Relative humidity\n          35-70%\n         Air speed\n          Slight air movement, without creating a draught.\n         Radiant heat\n          No direct exposure to uncontrolled radiant heat source or heat loss.\n         Hours for target levels\n          Occupied hours excluding extreme weather events.\n        Clothing\n          Light clothing.\n        \n          Winter clothing.\n         Source: modified from Worksafe New Zealand Information Sheet \u201cWhat you need to know about temperature in places of work\u201d to meet ASHRAE Standard 55 \u201cThermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy\u201d in University buildings. This target applies to all areas used for work, learning or research, and includes ancillary spaces used for these purposes (eg corridors containing informal learning or meeting space).It will not always be practical or cost-effective to meet these levels, so they are set as a target not a requirement.\n3. New buildings, and major redevelopments of existing buildings\nThe University's Facility Standards include provisions that will allow buildings to meet the target level of thermal comfort.All new buildings shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the University's Facility Standards.Major redevelopments of existing buildings which involve replacing building thermal elements (glazing, external walls, and/or HVAC systems) shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the relevant Facility Standards for those elements.\n4. Existing buildings\nWhere an existing building has HVAC systems, they will be operated to meet the target level of thermal comfort subject to the limitations noted in 1(c) above.Where an existing building cannot meet the target level of thermal comfort, remedial measures should be considered in consultation with the relevant Facility Manager, and could include measures such as blinds, external shades or performance coatings for windows, insulation, portable fans, glazing upgrades, improved control technology, supplementary heating or cooling etc.Thermal upgrade works will be programmed with reference to the Strategic Asset Management Plan and building priorities. Where possible, works will be undertaken within maintenance budgets for that building, but where significant cost is involved works will be subject to approval through the University's adaption or capital projects processes.No ventilation, heating or cooling machinery which is attached to the building such as heat pumps or air conditioning shall be installed unless this is approved by Property Services, to ensure safety, compliance and effectiveness.\n5. Where target level of thermal comfort cannot be met\nWhere the target level of thermal comfort cannot be met under Sections 2-4 above, people may take such measures as they can take themselves without affecting work obligations.Where those measures are not sufficient, people should discuss further options with their supervisor or manager to adjust their work to reduce discomfort.Any additional heaters, in-built fans or humidifiers should be requested from Property Services, to ensure safety, compliance and effectiveness.\n6. Health and Safety\nIn some circumstances thermal conditions can go beyond just being a comfort issue, and can create Health and Safety risks (e.g. extreme heat or cold, extremes of humidity, inability to wear correct protective equipment, inability to concentrate adequately for hazardous work).In those cases the response shall be at the discretion of the relevant supervisor or manager, with the options including relocating work to a different location or rescheduling work.Where such action is taken, the supervisor or manager must complete a Thermal Discomfort Notification (available on the Health and Safety website).\n7. Individual Requirements\nWhere an individual's personal circumstances require specific accommodation outside of the usual requirements (e.g. due to illness, a health condition or disability), the Occupational Health Team must be contacted for further assessment and the development of an action plan if required.",

This acknowledges the mauri (life force) of all natural resources, a concept which while predating modern concepts of a circular economy, can be seen as aligned with a waste hierarchy modelWaste management and minimisation across all University campuses and premises should align with the following hierarchy when addressing waste, thus acknowledging the mauri of the natural resource we have a responsibility for:Reduce, Rethink, RedesignReuse, Repair, RepurposeRecycle, Compost, Anaerobic digestion (waste broken down by microbes in the absence of oxygen)Recover value (eg. Energy) from materials that cannot be reused or recyclingTreat and disposeHealth and Safety Policy and Procedures must be followed at every point in the management of the University\u2019s waste. This may include the completion of a risk assessment to ensure consideration of aspects such as manual handling techniques.Innovation within the waste space is encouraged to promote the Waste Hierarchy.Regular reporting of waste is required.Operational Space Waste (e.g. office, kitchens, public, teaching)Waste minimisation should be considered when ordering operational supplies (including office, kitchen, trades etc): This includes rethinking the supplies that are needed to eliminate over-ordering.Orders should be grouped into batches to reduce packaging and transport associated with many small orders.Where more refillable or recyclable options are available, they should be considered first choice for purchasing giving reasonable consideration to cost.All assets should be managed in accordance with the Fixed Assets Procedure and the Waste Hierarchy. For example, the reuse/reallocation/gifting of furniture should be explored before disposal.All spaces must have: Separated waste streams which include as a minimum landfill, paper, and mixed recycling.Additional facilities for glass recycling\u00a0\u00a0where required, including kitchens, and common spaces.Additional facilities for specialised waste e.g. coffee ground bins\u00a0\u00a0as required.Clear signage and online resources to support the effective use of waste facilities.Where required, document destruction bins must be available for staff to use, or shredders must be available for use.All custodial service providers must have a clear understanding of the importance of, and processes for recycling in the areas in which they provide services.Staff and students with allocated office space should be given an induction to provide information about waste and recycling in their areas.Leased Spaces owned by the University, but not occupied by the University, must adhere to the University Waste Minimisation and Management Guidelines where practicable.Non-University owned leased spaces occupied by the University must follow the appropriate sections of the University Waste Minimisation and Management Guidelines where practicable.Organic Waste should be dealt with in alignment with the waste hierarchy Food waste should be minimised through effective ordering and recipe creation.Organic waste collections should occur were possible based on services available.Regular food waste audits should be conducted by kitchens to inform practice.Where possible, unsold/excess food should be donated to food waste recovery organisations, or other areas of need.Where possible organic gardening waste should be composted at the University facility (Dunedin).Consideration should be given to grounds design to reduce green waste from plantings that cannot be composted.Laboratory Laboratory waste must be dealt with in accordance with the health and safety guidelines (Blood and Body Fluid Exposure Policy, and the HSNO -Exempt Laboratory Compliance Policy).Departments using laboratories should consider creating laboratory waste plans to avoid excess waste being created and promote the Waste Hierarchy.Hazardous and specialised wasteHealth and safety policies must be followed for any Hazardous Waste, including but not limited to Health and Safety Policy, Asbestos Management Policy, Blood and Body Fluid Exposure Policy (Biohazard Safety Manual), HSNO-Exempt Laboratory Compliance policy and the Laboratory Biohazard Waste Disposal Procedures.Medical facilities e.g. clinics\u00a0\u00a0must follow section 3a and for any non-hazardous waste, sections 2a-2f should be considered.For new products containing refrigerants, the Design and Facility Standards (available from Campus Development) must be followed to reduce and eliminate the end disposal waste of greenhouse gases (such as hydrofluorocarbons).Existing items (e.g. Heat Pumps and refrigeration units) containing refrigerants (hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons and chlorofluorocarbons) must follow the relevant regulations for disposal.The Waste Hierarchy as described above should be applied to E-Waste and batteries, while complying with the Asset Procedures. This may include: reuse of products across the University (preferable), repurpose to students, schools, and community groups, or if neither reuse or repurpose is possible, then recycling should occur.No E-Waste or batteries are to be placed in the general waste due to the environmental and fire risk implications of E-Waste in the landfill collection and disposal.Residential Colleges and UniflatsSustainability and the Waste Hierarchy should be considered in all aspects of campus living.Furniture across the Residential Colleges and Uniflats should be managed in accordance with the Asset Management Procedure and the Waste Hierarchy.All aspects of section 2 should be considered where practicable.Food waste should be avoided by ordering what is required, re-serving excess portions when appropriate, consideration in menu planning decisions, and donating to food recovery organisations or other appropriate recipients.Single-Use items such as disposable plates and cutlery should be discouraged, and where present they should be subject to Actionable Recycling.Users must be provided with adequate disposal instructions for Actionable Recycling to take place.All common spaces should have recycling and rubbish options available as per Section 2.Responsible waste behaviour should be part of all student\u2019s induction at all Residential Colleges and Uniflats.Construction and Trade Services WasteWaste should be considered in all aspects of construction projects.All projects should have a waste minimisation plan that follows the Waste Hierarchy to reduce the environmental impact of the build, including monitoring and measuring their waste to ensure diversion targets are met.Where possible, items should be reused or repurposed, including offering unused products to community groups where practicableWaste should be sorted into recyclable materials: The following materials should be sorted for recycling, depending on what is practicable: MetalsPlasterboardUntreated woodPVC pippingE-waste (including batteries)Other where available in locationsEventsWaste should be considered when organising conferences or onsite Events.All Events and conferences must have facilities to effectively collect separated waste streams, supported by clear signage or communication to support their effective use.Paperless or reduced paper is preferable.Single-use items (including conference favours) are discouraged.All Event holders will be provided with resources on how to effectively sort their waste in the Event location (ensuring Actionable Recycling).All Events must have a waste reduction and management plan.Food outletsWaste must be considered at all university food outlets in accordance with Section 2, which should include ordering supplies to eliminate over ordering, grouping batches to reduce packaging and transport, and focusing on purchasing refillable or recyclable options.All campus outlets must be single use cup free.All assets should be managed in accordance with the Assets Procedure and the Waste Hierarchy.Separated waste streams must include as a minimum landfill, glass, and mixed recycling.Food waste must be treated as per Section 2.Waste must be considered in the selection of all packaging, including eliminating all single use plastic items and substituting items which are Actionably Recyclable.All outlets must support \u201cuser brings\u201d packaging options where health and safety allows.Premises leased by non-University occupants operating as food outlets and food trucks must follow these guidelines were practicable.ProcurementWaste should be considered during procurement processes to ensure both contractors and the University follow the Waste Hierarchy.Contractors ordering materials on behalf of the University should be asked to: Rethink the supplies that are needed to eliminate over ordering,group orders into batches to reduce packaging and transport associated with many small orders, andwhere practicable, select more refillable or recyclable options as first choice for purchasing.Custodial Services contractors should consider the Waste Hierarchy during the removal of waste from buildings. If excessive contamination occurs, building users must be notified.Contractors must abide by the University Guidelines for Waste Minimisation and Management when on site.Emergency Waste Management PlanIn the case of an emergency where Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) protocols are enacted, specific waste management processes and actions may be required which do not comply with these guidelines.In such situations, waste management resources should be directed to supporting the emergency relief effort and enabling a safe return to usual practice, while complying with health and safety requirements such as appropriate protective equipment.",

This will be updated following review. \n          \n             15 April 2020 \n          Purpose succinctly describes the reason for the policy document. It should not provide commentary on the importance of the matter addressed, nor a justification for approving the policy document (these matters can be addressed in a covering memorandum when approval is sought).Scope describes the people, areas or processes the policy document applies to (e.g. \u201cUniversity-wide\u201d, \u201cthese procedures apply to all staff of the University\u201d, \u201cthis policy applies to all final examinations at the University\u201d).Definitions cover technical terms, terms which are used in a specific way within the policy document and/or acronyms used in the policy document.\u00a0\u00a0Terms not used in the policy document and commonly understood terms (defined in the normal way) should not be included in the definitions.\u00a0\u00a0Where possible definitions should match definitions in other policy documents, on the University terminology webpage, or in other existing documents. It may be helpful to decide on terms to include in the definitions section after content is drafted.Content contains the main contents of the policy document, normally divided into clauses and sub-clauses, and formatted as specified in clause 2 below.Contact provides the position that may be contacted for more information on the policy document.\u00a0\u00a0This is normally the Responsible Officer, but in some cases may be another staff member whose work is related to the matter covered.\u00a0\u00a0Where possible, a role-based email address should be used for contact, rather than a name-based email address.Related policies, procedures and forms provides links to University policies and any other internal or external documents that may be relevant to the users of the policy (please include hyperlinks to all related documents available on the web). Documents which are unlikely to be helpful and/or accessed should not be included.\u00a0\u00a0If the list of related documents is long, this can be divided into sections (e.g. University policies and procedures, Other University resources, External resources, etc.)Consultation should list all parties formally consulted with in preparing or reviewing the policy document.\u00a0\u00a0Parties that have been given the chance to comment but have not provided feedback should also normally be listed.\u00a0\u00a0These details are for the information of the Approval Body and are not included when the policy document is published in the Policy Library.Keywords should include several words relating to the policy to assist with internet searches.\u00a0\u00a0These will be used as metadata when the policy document is published in the Policy Library.All new or significantly amended policy documents must contain an Implementation and Communication plan, including: Person responsible, who will coordinate the Implementation and Communication Plan (often the Responsible Officer).Communication strategy for communicating the policy to the wider University and other interested parties.Other actions/tasks to allow implementation of the policy (e.g. upgrading IT systems).Resources, including any monetary costs, in order to implement the policy.Completion date for completing implementation and communication.  The date of the policy coming into effect can be delayed after approval to allow implementation activities to be completed (see clause 1(b) \u2013 \u201cDate Policy Took Effect\u201d \u2013 above).\n2. Drafting policy documents\nPolicy documents should be written in clear, concise and unambiguous language, and formatted so as to be easily readable.\u00a0\u00a0For policies and procedures, policy writers should aim to say what needs to be said with the minimum amount of text necessary (guidelines may include more detail).\u00a0\u00a0Jargon should be avoided.Policy writers should consult and apply the University Writing Style Guide.Policy writers should use template or sample policy documents available in the Policy Resources section on the Policy Library webpage.The contents of a policy document should be organised into numbered (e.g. 1, 2, 3) clauses or sections.\u00a0\u00a0Sections should be labelled to allow users to easily find the information they are looking for.Within each section, sub-clauses should be represented by letters (e.g. (a), (b), (c)).\u00a0\u00a0Each sub-clause should relate to a single idea and link to the topic of the section concerned.Where necessary, additional points can be listed under a sub-clause using small roman numerals (e.g. i, ii, iii).\u00a0\u00a0Bullet points may be used for clear lists of items, but the use of roman numerals is normally preferable.\u00a0\u00a0See also the University Writing Style Guide on bullet points/lists.For referencing purposes, text which is not in a numbered or lettered clause or sub-clause (as per sub-clauses 2(d) to (f) above) should be avoided.Consistent spacing and tabbing should be applied to enhance readability.Once drafting is complete, spelling and grammar checks should be run and the policy document manually proofread for errors and unclear or ambiguous language.\n3. Initiating new policy\nBefore initiating a new policy document consideration should be given as to whether a formal University-level policy is needed.\u00a0\u00a0The proposed policy Sponsor should be involved in these discussions.\u00a0\u00a0Questions that might be considered include: Is the matter addressed of University-wide significance?\u00a0\u00a0More local issues can be dealt with by departmental or Divisional policy.Is the matter addressed likely to be of ongoing significance? Policy should not normally be used to address transitory matters.Will a policy document have some tangible impact?\u00a0\u00a0Policies which have little real impact are discouraged.Will a policy document only describe operational processes?\u00a0\u00a0Unless they need to be formally communicated and established across the University, operational processes should not normally be expressed via University policy documents.Is there another more appropriate way to address the matter at hand, e.g. via communication with relevant parties, operational changes, etc.If a policy document is appropriate, is there any existing policy that could be amended to deal with the matter at hand, or is a new policy document needed?Different approaches may be appropriate for determining the initial content of a policy document: For technical policy documents, or policy documents arising from clear legislative or regulatory requirements, it may be appropriate for a single staff member to determine the initial policy content.Where the initial direction of a policy document is clear, but input from a range of areas is needed in the initial stages, a single staff member may work in informal consultation with a range of relevant staff.For matters which require expertise from a number of areas and/or where the initial direction of the policy document is not clear, a formal working group to determine content may be appropriate. For consistency and efficiency a single member of the working group should take primary responsibility for drafting initial content.Consideration should be given to whether a policy document should be classified as Policy, Procedures, Guidelines or a Code of Practice.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to taking into account the definitions of each of these types of document (see \u201cDefinitions\u201d above) the following may be considered: Policy is considered the highest level of the policy documents and is most appropriate for expressing a University position on a matter and/or detailing responsibilities of various parties (e.g. Heads of Departments).Procedures are particularly appropriate when detailing a specific course of action or process.Guidelines are appropriate for providing advice and/or for outlining a more general course of action.\u00a0\u00a0Compliance with guidelines is expected, but in exceptional circumstances justifiable variations from guidelines are permitted.Codes of Practice, which are less common, provide expected standards which must be complied with and normally relate to a specific domain (e.g. Responsible Practice in Research). A final determination on the right classification for a policy document may be made after initial content is drafted (content may help guide the classification).Where drafted policy content has a combination of policy, procedure and guideline aspects, a decision may be made on whether multiple documents are needed (e.g. a policy and associated guidelines) or whether a single document will suffice. Ease of use by those accessing the policy document(s) should guide this decision.A single document is often preferable for simplicity, unless this makes the document too long or complex.It is acceptable to have a policy which also includes procedural details and/or associated guidance.\n4. Review of policy documents\nPolicy review should consider: whether the policy is achieving its purpose and is still neededwhether the policy reflects the current University context and/or current University practiceany lessons learnt since the policy was initiated or last reviewedany changes to related policies, regulations, statutes, legislation or other documentswhether the policy is well understood, andwhether the policy is clearly written and formatted in accordance with these guidelines.Policy review should be supported by objective evidence where possible, which may include feedback sought and received from policy document users, and statistics on access to the policy document within the Policy Library (contact policy@otago.ac.nz for this information).Where policy review leads to significant changes to a policy document, consultation on the amended document should take place as per clause 6 below.Completed policy reviews should be sent to the Policy Management Group, regardless of whether the review recommends changes to the existing policy document or not.\u00a0\u00a0This should be accompanied by a completed Policy Review Coversheet, available in the Policy Resources section on the Policy Library webpageAdditional information on policy review is available in clause 5 of the Policy Framework.\n5. Amendment of policy outside of formal reviews\nFor editorial amendments and administrative amendments which are required outside of a scheduled policy review, Responsible Officers should contact policy@otago.ac.nz with an explanation of the reason for the change and the amendment required.\u00a0\u00a0Such changes can be approved under clauses 4(a) and (b) of the Policy Framework.Minor amendments which are required outside of a scheduled policy review should be sent to the Policy Management Group for approval, with an explanation as to why the changes are required. Consultation should take place as appropriate to the extent of the changes (see clause 6 below).Where major amendments are required outside of a scheduled policy review, thought should be given to fully reviewing the policy at that point. For major changes consultation (clause 6) is strongly recommended and formal approval (clause 7) is required regardless of whether a full review is conducted.Minor and major amendments outside of a scheduled policy review should only take place where there is a reasonable case for making the changes immediately. Otherwise, they should be deferred until the next policy review.\n6. Consultation\nConsultation allows the policy writer to test for broad acceptance and understanding of the proposed new or amended document and to identify any relevant matters which may have been overlooked in initial drafting.Groups to consult with will vary depending on the matters addressed, but could include: Academic Divisionsother University campusesspecialist academic areas (e.g. Summer School, Distance Learning)groups that can offer specialist advice on relevant matters (e.g. Planning and Funding, Human Resources, the University Library)staffstudents (often via OUSA )external stakeholdersM\u0101oriequity groupsrelevant committees, andrelevant senior managers, andthose with operational responsibilities under the policy document (e.g. ITS , administrative units).It is usually preferable to consult widely for new and significantly amended policy documents, but consulting with groups with little connection to the matters being addressed should be avoided.Consultation materials should include a covering memorandum or equivalent communication explaining the reason for the policy document, highlighting any important points and, in the case of amended policy, detailing key changes.Where an existing policy document has been amended, changes should be clearly indicated: for less extensive amendments, the use of tracked changes is recommendedfor more extensive but still limited changes, highlighting amended text and including the current policy for comparison is recommended, orfor comprehensively rewritten text, presenting both the amended and current policy document is recommended, with key changes highlighted in a covering memorandum.Sufficient time should be given for parties to respond to consultation requests (four to six weeks is standard).Where consultation produces significantly different viewpoints, a focused meeting with key parties may be an effective way to choose an appropriate approach.\n7. Approval of new and amended policy documents\nNew and significantly amended policy documents being sent for final approval must (in order): be sent to the policy Sponsor for endorsementbe sent to the Policy Management Group for endorsement, and thenbe sent to the appropriate Approval Body for final approval.Responsible Officers should take account of relevant committee meeting dates in planning for implementation of a policy document.Materials sent for approval should include a covering memorandum explaining the reason for the policy document, highlighting any important points and, in the case of amended policy, detailing key changes (this may be based on the consultation memorandum \u2013 see clause 6(d) above).Following step 7(a)ii above, the covering memorandum should also note that the policy document has been seen and endorsed by the Policy Management Group.\u00a0\u00a0Where the Policy Management Group has recommended amendments it should be noted that the Group's recommendation(s) have been incorporated (for which no explanation is required) and/or detail any substantive recommendations that have not been incorporated, with a brief explanation as to why not.Where an existing policy document has been amended, changes should be clearly indicated: for less extensive amendment, the use of tracked changes is recommendedfor more extensive but still limited changes, highlighting amended text and including the current policy for comparison is recommended, orfor comprehensively rewritten text, presenting both the amended and current policy document is recommended, with key changes highlighted in a covering memorandum.The Responsible Officer should be prepared to attend any relevant committee meeting to speak to the proposed policy document and answer any questions.Following approval the Responsible Officer must: make any changes required by the Approval Bodyprovide the Secretary of the Policy Management Group with the finalised copy of the policy document (email policy@otago.ac.nz) (the Secretary will coordinate the updating of the Policy Library), andensure completion of the Implementation and Communication Plan (see 1(k) above).",

        "scope": "The guidelines apply to all areas of the Dunedin campus and properties unless indicated otherwise.",
        "content": "Overview of Sustainable Campus Grounds Maintenance PrinciplesRespect for te taiao (the environment) is integral to he tirohaka M\u0101ori (a M\u0101ori perspective) and should be upheld in all grounds maintenance activities.When planning grounds maintenance, the following must all be considered: minimising any negative impact, enhancing biodiversity, respecting heritage value, and supporting the health and wellbeing of the university community.Sustainable grounds maintenance includes, but is not limited to, the scope and frequency of maintenance, cost management, diversion of waste from landfill, minimisation of chemical use, energy and water use, plant specific maintenance requirements, recording and reporting, responsiveness to non-compliance, and the process of reviewing both compliance and guidelines.Scope and frequency of the maintenance programmeThe Campus Services (Grounds) team within the Property and Campus Development Division will complete the following tasks as part of the ongoing maintenance of the Dunedin Campus grounds: Lawn mowing consisting of approximately 38 cuts per year based on temperature. During September and December lawns are mowed weekly, between January and May lawns are mowed fortnightly, and between June and August lawns are mowed once per month.Lawn care is completed as and when required, which is managed by the Team Leader Campus Services.Garden maintenance is completed weekly.Moss treatment of paths and paved areas completed in Autumn or as requested.Rubbish/litter collection is done on a daily basis during semester and three times per week during semester breaks.Tree care and arborist activities should be minimal at early stages of tree growth, but as trees mature, they will get a form prune every 5 years, depending on the weather, growth and other risk factors.The grounds are inspected weekly by the Team Lead, Campus Services (Grounds) who can adjust the schedule as and when necessary.Sustainability requirementsTo ensure the University meets its goals for sustainable campus grounds maintenance, the following requirements have been set:Diversion from landfill When practicable, green waste that will easily compost within 12 months is diverted to the University\u2019s green waste composting facility in Sawyers Bay.Food waste from campus operations, that has been processed into soil improver, will be added to the green waste compost mix to further enhance the nutrients recovered and brought back to campus as compost.All other green waste such as leaves which do not readily break down in compost, is put into our green waste skips and transported by our waste management provider.All green waste will be measured and recorded so that it can be monitored and reported on within the University\u2019s annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory.Where compost is required on existing grounds or developing new features, compost from our Sawyers Bay facility will be considered first choice subject to availability and specific requirements.Minimisation of chemical use Chemicals are only used if necessary and in the context of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) where multiple measures are used in a coordinated manner, subject to separate legislative compliance and auditing.Where suitable, organic mulch will be considered as part of weed suppression.Energy and water use Wherever possible electric mowers and other tools are used rather than fossil fuelled tools.Where fossil fuelled tools are necessary it will be at the discretion of Team Lead of Campus Services (Grounds).Irrigation is minimal due to the Dunedin climate and there will be no irrigation in Winter, Autumn and Spring.The minimal amount of water used in Summer is from the city mains.Irrigation water use is reported within total water use in the University\u2019s annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory.Plant specific maintenance requirements Plant selection will consider minimisation of maintenance and replacement.Where possible plant selection and maintenance will support native biodiversity including lichens, bryophytes, invertebrates and vertebrates.Where appropriate food producing plants will be considered as a contribution to food security in the University community.Biodiversity and food security Where possible plant selection and maintenance will support native biodiversity including lichens, bryophytes, invertebrates and vertebrates.Where appropriate campus grounds maintenance should support No-Mow Zones, where lawns are allowed to grow without mowing, thus supporting greater biodiversity in that area.From time to time No-Mow Zones may need to be cut and reseeded, such as when invasive weeds need to be controlled.Where appropriate food producing plants will be considered as a contribution to food security in the University community.Climate resilience Plant choice and landscape design should consider anticipated changes in climate such as increased drought intensity and frequency, more severe and more frequent storms, and higher peak rainfalls.These considerations should include but are not limited to increased shaded areas to provide resilience in heat, increased porous areas to absorb rainfall in flood events, and risk assessment of potential damage by and to vegetation in higher winds.RecordingAll maintenance requirements fall into Corrective or Preventive Maintenance depending on the type of work request.All work requests will be recorded within the Property and Campus Development Division\u2019s Integrated Work Management System, Property +.Grounds maintenance conducted by contractorsFrom time to time, grounds maintenance may be conducted by contractors rather than University trades staff, such as in the first period of commissioning a new building, before final hand over to the University.Consideration of these guidelines is essential when procuring and managing contracts for this type of work to ensure a consistent approach across campus.Review processThe Team Lead of Campus Services (Grounds) will review the guidelines after one year of implementation then every three years to ensure it is fit for purpose and that any lessons learned have been incorporated into the document.The results of the review will be shared with the key stakeholders including Property and Campus Development, and Toit\u016b te Taiao (The Sustainability Office).Emergency grounds maintenanceIn the case of an emergency where Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) protocols are enacted, specific grounds activities and processes may be required which do not comply with these guidelines.In such situations, grounds maintenance resources should be directed to supporting the emergency relief effort and enabling a safe return to usual practice, while complying with health and safety requirements such as appropriate protective equipment.",

        "scope": "These guidelines apply to all appointments of Research Funded Permanent Staff.",
        "content": "1. What is this category of Employment?\nStaff may be appointed to this category of employment where their employment is dependent on the continuation of sufficient research funding, as determined by the University.\nAlthough ongoing funding for the position is not certain, the employment will be permanent i.e. not fixed-term*. However, because both the staff and their Department will be well aware of the inherent uncertainty around continuation of the funding and therefore the role, the procedures for ending or altering employment due to the ending or reduction of funding are simpler and quicker than standard management of change procedures.\nThis category can apply to academic and general staff.\n *Fixed-term appointments are those where the employment is for a fixed term, for a specific purpose, with an end date specified. For more details on fixed-term appointment, please contact the Human Resources Division for advice. \n2. Who can be appointed to this category?\nPeople should be considered for this category if at the time of appointment:\nThey have been performing the same or similar research funded work within the same Department, on fixed-term agreements, for four or more years duration; orIt is the Department's assessment that the position is expected to be funded for the foreseeable future\n3. Are the terms and conditions different for this category?\nTerms and conditions such as salary, leave, and superannuation are the same for this category as for other categories of permanent staff. The only differences are around the provisions that relate to funding ceasing to be sufficient to keep the position\n4. What happens if the research funding ceases to be sufficient to keep a position(s)?\nIt is important for Principle Investigators and/or Heads of Department to consult with their Divisional HR Manager or Advisor immediately if they become aware that positions may be at risk due to the cessation of funding. This will enable an appropriate process to be put in place, which generally will consist of the following steps:\nIf circumstances arise that could result in a research funded position becoming surplus to the University's needs, staff and the Union(s) will be advised and two weeks will be provided for consultation about the implications of this change.If, following the consultation period, the University decides it is necessary to end the employment of research funded staff, they will be provided with one month's notice of this.During the notice period, options will be explored with them such as retraining and redeployment.If redeployment does not occur, the person's employment would end by way of redundancy.\n5. Do people employed in this category receive redundancy compensation?\nStaff employed in this category, who are made redundant, will receive compensation in accordance with the terms of their employment agreement.\n6. What happens if, as a result of a redundancy situation, a person is redeployed to other roles?\nNormally if a person is redeployed to another permanent role anywhere in the University, no redundancy compensation will be payable.\nIf the redeployment is to a fixed-term position and payment of redundancy compensation (at the end of that fixed-term) is reasonable in the circumstances, the HR Director may approve the payment of redundancy compensation and will determine the conditions related to this.\nIf, as a result of a reduction in funding a person agrees to reduce their hours of work, redundancy compensation will be payable, on a pro rata basis.\n7. Who meets the cost of any redundancy compensation?\nThe \u201cPolicy\u201d regarding the funding of redundancy payments for this category is:\nIn the Division of Heath Sciences, the costs will be split 1/3 Division, 1/3 School and 1/3 Department.In the other Divisions, the costs will be split 2/3 Division and 1/3 School.\nIn the case of redeployment to a fixed-term position (where redundancy compensation has been agreed), that also involves a transfer to another department, the basis for cost sharing for any payments will also be discussed between the Departments at the time and agreed and documented before the transfer is made.\n8. How long can a person remain employed in this category?\nTechnically a person can remain employed in this category indefinitely, however after a period of years it may be reasonable for a person to transfer to permanent employment. This will be by recommendation to the HR Director by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (on advice from the Head of Department). It is recommended that the status of people in this category is reviewed after six years of employment in the research funded permanent category.",
        "q1_response": "Based on the provided policy data, the following policies appear to contain unnecessary content:\n\n1. The reference to cross-references to other policies in section 7 (\"Who meets the cost of any redundancy compensation?\") specifically mentions that for redeployment to a fixed-term position (where redundancy compensation has been agreed), that also involves a transfer to another department, the basis for cost sharing for any payments will also be discussed between the Departments at the time and agreed and documented before the transfer is made.\n\nWhile this section does provide relevant information about the process of transferring departments, it seems like an added layer of detail not directly necessary for understanding the overall policy.",
        "q2_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified two policies that contain parts that are actually procedures, not policies:\n\n1. The Research_Funded_Permanent_Staff_Guidelines policy.\n2. q1_response (the evaluation of the policy by an unknown author).\n\nHowever, if we only consider the original policy records, then there is only one policy that contains parts that are actually procedures, not policies:\n\n1.

        "q3_response": "After reviewing the policy data, I have identified the following policies as containing inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. None of the policies explicitly state who is responsible for ensuring compliance with these guidelines.\n\nAll other policies are free from major structural flaws and only contain minor redundant information",
        "q4_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, here are my observations:\n\n**Redundancy or incorrect structure:**\n\n* Section 5 of the policy states that redundancy compensation will be payable if a person is redeployed to another permanent role. However, in section 8, it is mentioned that \"Normally\" redeployment to a fixed-term position does not result in redundancy compensation. This inconsistency needs clarification.\n* In section 7, there are two different methods for cost sharing between the Division, School, and Department. While this may be necessary for specific departments or divisions, it would be better to have a single, consistent method throughout the policy.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n\n* Consider having a separate procedure document that outlines the process for reviewing an employee's status after six years of employment in the research funded permanent category.\n* The policy could benefit from clearer language around who is responsible for ensuring compliance with these guidelines. This could be achieved by designating specific individuals or departments as responsible for implementing and monitoring the policies.\n* Some sections, such as section 8, may contain unnecessary details that are not directly relevant to the overall policy. These can be removed to improve clarity.\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe policy appears to be well-structured and clearly outlines the guidelines for research funded permanent staff. However, there are a few areas where the language could be improved, and some consistency issues need attention.",

This suggests that it might be better structured as a procedure manual instead of a policy document.\n\nThere are no clear-cut redundancy issues with the 'Resources_for_Graduate_Research_Candidates_Guidelines' policy, as both instances of the redundant sentence serve a similar purpose. However, it would be beneficial to consolidate or remove one instance of this sentence to make the policy more concise.\n\nAs for structural flaws, the policy document contains procedures instead of rules or principles, which might not be ideal.

        "scope": "These guidelines apply to all University of Otago workplaces.",
        "content": "1. Introduction\nElectricity is a recognised hazard in the workplace and can lead to direct (e.g. electric shock) or indirect injury (e.g. from resulting fire, etc.).Electrical equipment can become faulty and regular inspections and testing can reduce the chances of faulty equipment leading to a hazardous situation.The testing of portable electrical equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2010 is a recognised reasonably practical step to meeting the requirements of the HSWA.\n2. What to test\nNon-specialised appliances Electrical equipment that is portable or frequently moved that is connected by a flexible cord to a power supply. Examples of this are kitchen appliances, overhead projectors, lights/lamps, heaters, computers etc. Cord extension sets, electrical portable outlet devices (EPOD's/multi-boxes), flexible cords, portable isolation transformers and RCD's (portable type, socket outlet type) also require testing.Specialised electrical equipment Each Department has a responsibility to identify specialised equipment. For example, medical equipment that attaches to patients. Once identified this needs to be referred to a specialist testing company or registered electrician to be tested.Where an appliance requires testing, but may be susceptible to damage by the testing process the manufacture instructions need to be obtained and adhered with.\n3. When to test\nThe standard requires testing of portable electrical equipment at the following times: Prior to initial introduction to service. If the equipment is new, AS/NZS 3760:2010 requires that this equipment be inspected, tested and tagged on entry to service;Before return to service after a repair or servicing, which could have affected the electrical safety;Prior to each hire of the equipment (for hire equipment, inspection only) and additionally tested at not greater than monthly intervals; andAs per table 2 of the standard (summarised from AZ/NZS 3760:2010).Type of environment and/or equipment (including cord extensions and EPOD's). Testing interval for each type of environment: Workshops - 6 monthsLaboratories (chemical laboratories), teaching spaces, tea rooms and office kitchens - 12 monthsOffice environment where equipment flexible cords are subject to flexing in normal use (e.g. OHP that is frequently moved around) - 12 monthsOffice environment where equipment is not subject to flexing of cords in normal use - 5 yearsResidential type areas (e.g.: accommodation) - 2 years.Construction and demolition sites - refer to AS/NZS 3012 for time frames and testing regime requirements. This is not the complete table. To view the complete table, please refer to AS/NZS 3760:2010 or contact Health, Safety and Wellbeing.\n4. Prioritising Equipment\nIt is recognised that some departments have a significant number of portable items for testing and that the initial testing will take some time for completion. Priorities for testing may need to be identified by the Department, depending on the degree of risk. Risk factors for consideration include: the environment the equipment is being used in e.g. wet areas, or equipment on stainless steel benchesthe age of the equipment (old=risk)equipment that is frequently moved, plugged and unpluggedequipment that is used by workers or students on a frequent and regular basis; andequipment that has high usage, including hiring to other departments and field work.This list is not exhaustive and departments are responsible for identifying the electrical equipment, documenting the regime for testing, and providing sufficient resources to achieve the plan.In addition to the testing regime, all workers should visually check electrical equipment prior to use and report any deficiencies. The visual check should include: obvious damage or defects to connectors, plugs, extension outlet sockets such as cracks, splits, burns, etc.flexible cords are anchored to equipment, plugs and cord extension socketscord sheaths are not cut, twisted or damaged so that the inner core is visibleno insulation tape has been used to cover wirescontrols in good working ordercovers, guards, etc. are secured and in working ordercheck that the ventilation inlets and exhausts are unobstructed.Any deficiencies identified by a visual inspection should be isolated for electrical testing and repaired if required. Mark the item with a DANGER - DO NOT USE tag and remove from the environment.All University of Otago workers must visually check equipment prior to use and report all faults or damage to electrical equipment to your DHSO or Technical Manager. Under no circumstances is a person to repair the electrical equipment, unless they are a registered electrician. All faulty or failed tested electrical equipment shall be removed and a permanent label or DANGER: DO NOT USE tag must be attached to prevent use.\n5. Who can test equipment?\nThe standard requires a competent person, who has acquired through training, qualification, experience or a combination of these; has the knowledge and skill to perform the testing task correctly. The University defines a competent person as one or more of the following: A registered electrician, or registered technician with electrical certificationA worker who is designated by the Head of Department or Support Service Manager to be an electrical tester, who has completed the necessary 'Competent Person' course within the last 2 years.A central testing meter is available for hire from Health, Safety and Wellbeing.\n6. Tester Responsibilities\nTested equipment must be clearly marked with a durable, non-reusable, non-metallic tag. The tag must identify the name of the person or company who tested the equipment, and the test or re-test date;To maintain documentation of the testing regime; andTo clearly label any items that does not pass the test. This equipment must be clearly marked or removed from the work area, and arrangements made to have the equipment repaired or destroyed. The label shall state ONLY REGISTERED ELECTRICIANS OR CERTIFIED SPECIALIST CAN REPAIR EQUIPMENT.\n7. Documentation\nWhere records of test and inspection are kept, the following should all be recorded: a register of all equipmenta record of formal inspection and testsa repair registera record of all faulty equipment.Regulatory requirements may require documentation to be kept in some cases. Refer to: AS/NZS 3000 (Electrical Installations)AS/NZS 3003 (Electrical installations - patient treatment areas of hospital and medical and dental practices)AS/NZS 3551 (Technical management programs for medical devices)AS/NZS 3012 (Electrical Installations - construction & demolition sites)AS/NZS 4249 (Electrical Safety Practices - film, video and television sites)In addition, records should be kept when the item in question is likely to need retesting within its prescribed lifetime.\n8. Medical Equipment\nMedical equipment (any equipment that attaches to patients/clients or animals) is specialised and has specific requirements. All medical equipment is to be tested by a certified specialist or registered electrician. Refer to The standard (New Zealand Electrical Code of Practice) NZECP 12.\n9. Equipment brought on site\nPrivately owned and/or manufactured item of equipment that is brought on site for demonstration or private use, must be tested for electrical safety prior to use. A tag needs to be applied and records maintained of the testing.\n10. Heaters\nNo portable bar type heaters may be used on site within the University.",

        "scope": "The Guidelines apply to all staff and students of the University of Otago.",
        "content": "PreambleWhere recordings of lectures and other teaching sessions are concerned, two questions should be considered: How can we take advantage of the ability to record our teaching sessions to support and enhance our papers, teaching and learning? To guide a response to this question, this document outlines principles underpinning good practices related to lecture recording at the University of Otago.Should lectures be recorded? This question is best answered at the Department / Programme / paper level. It is intended that the principles and practices outlined in this document will contribute to, and inform, local discussion and decision making.It is important to note that lecturer recording is optional at the University of Otago, but that the decision to record or not to record should be founded on departmental discussion. It is important that staff and students are clear about the rationale behind decisions concerning the recording of teaching activities.Research has shown the potential benefits of lecture recordings to student learning. However, there are still concerns that the provision of lecture recordings to students might alter the nature of students' engagement with learning in negative rather than positive ways.Wider concerns about the place of the lecture within any paper, and the changing value placed on 'the lecture' by teachers and students, point to broader challenges that are related to a myriad of factors including the evolving nature of teaching and learning at university, felt in many higher education contexts across the world.At Otago, an ongoing exploration of implementing institution-wide lecture recording protocols across all papers has revealed that decisions to record are at the discretion of the Department, Programme, or Division. This arrangement enables decision-making about recordings to be made at the level where it makes most sense.It is important that the issue of the gradual decline in the numbers of students attending lectures in person that was occurring before the pandemic, is separated from the focus of this document, which is about the thoughtful and deliberate use of lecture recordings. The relationship between declining lecture attendance and lecture recording is not a simple causal one. It cannot be assumed that recording lectures is the only reason for declining numbers of students attending lectures in person, in real time. While the nature of student access to lectures through the provision of recorded lectures does have an impact on engagement, a lecture, whether recorded or in-person, is only one component in a whole system of interacting and interdependent components that make up a whole learning environment.Based on the assumption that the ability to record teaching and learning events is possible, this document focuses attention on presenting a set of guiding principles and practices to inform discussion and decision-making about how to use recordings in ways that will capitalise upon the advantages they can have for teachers, learners, and the enhancement of the learning environment.PrinciplesRecorded lectures are resources that teachers and students can utilise to enhance engagement and support active learning and promote equitable access for diverse students. A lecture or a lecture recording is one resource and, like resources available to students in a library, teachers cannot assume that the lecture or its recording will, on its own, provide sufficient support for students to succeed in their learning.Lecture recordings can be used as supplementary learning materials or, as in situations such as a pandemic, they can be critical resources for supporting emergency and remote learning.For distance and online students, lecture recordings may provide the mainstay of teaching and thus, in some situations, be core to student learning.Lecture recording supports accessibility and inclusion for students with vision impairments; dyslexia and other learning difficulties; autism spectrum disorders; anxiety; and other disabilities, as well as note-takers where these are provided by Disability Information and Support.There are various recording types, including, for example, class lecture recordings, student activities, teacher-self recordings, voice-over audio recordings, recordings where patients or guest lecturers are involved. Each type of recording requires that any intellectual property rights and associated privacy concerns be addressed.The provision of recorded lectures can be used to guide students towards directing their own learning in ways they know suit them best. Teachers play a critical role in directing and guiding students' use of recorded lectures to help students get the most from the resource.Active student engagement in learning is encouraged when teachers integrate recorded lectures appropriately within learning activities.Lecture recordings that contain third-party copyrighted material need to acquire appropriate copyright permission. Special attention should be given to adhering to legal requirements concerning intellectual property rights, academic freedom and privacy legislation, policy and regulations.Both teachers and students have responsibilities where the storage, access and distribution of recordings are concerned.See details in the Recording of Lectures and Other Teaching Activities Policy and the practical considerations outlined in the Copyright at Otago webpages. Recording of Lectures and Other Teaching Activities PolicyCopyright at OtagoThe introduction of new technology, including lecture recordings, into any aspect of teaching does have an impact. Monitoring possible effects that the introduction of any significant change to a paper on student engagement and teaching processes is important. This includes the introduction and use of lecture recordings.Teachers can obtain analytics about how students engage with lecture recordings and use them as evidence of learning uptake and paper evaluation.Interpretation of that data should be undertaken with consideration of the student, the particular paper, and the wider teaching and learning context.Practice guidelines for staffKnow how to make and use recordings Participate in training in the use of Echo360, including how to use the editing features and how to set up student access for your students enrolled in your papers Echo360 help for Otago staffEngage with staff at HEDC to discuss best practices in using recordings to enhance teaching and learning, and through participating in TELT Show Case sessions or TELT Master Classes.If you plan to use closed captioning or transcription, be aware of the language limitations of the system you are using. For example, closed captioning is usually set to a specific language. Additionally, te reo M\u0101ori will not be translated as te reo and this may cause offence. Moreover, there is a rangatiratanga issue here.Inform your students Provide explicit guidance to students about how to use recordings effectively and appropriately in your paper. Recordings will be more effective and supportive of student learning if they are made and used with thought and deliberate planning.In the Course Outline for your paper, include information about: how lecture recordings will be used to support learning.details about access to the recordings.when recordings will be released.where to find the recordings within Blackboard / Moodle / equivalent or Echo360 and length of time they will be available.Proposed template for course outline (DOC)When planning learning activities that make use of lecture recordings, calculate a realistic workload time and share that with your students to help guide them in how much time to spend on the activity.If the decision is that recordings of some or all the teaching sessions in a paper will not be made, ensure that you understand, and can explain, the rationale behind the decision to your students. In your explanation, draw attention to the nature of the activity and its connection with the learning outcomes. For example: Small group work that involves discussion and free-flowing interaction and focused activity, do not lend themselves to creating useful recordings. When the purpose and intent of the learning activity is to generate active engagement in this way, a recording will not facilitate the kind of engagement that is required for learning by a student who watches the recording without direct participation.Teaching sessions that highlight sensitive or personal information or deal with topics that could trigger adverse reactions from students are not suitable for recording. In these instances, careful/expert and responsive facilitation by a lecturer is vital, and cannot form part of a recording.If the decision is that recordings of some or all the teaching sessions in a paper will not be made, acknowledge that students may miss classes due to work, family or health reasons and note that alternatives will be available. Explain also that the provision of alternatives does not directly translate into making/providing recordings. This is especially the case when there is no commitment made at the start of the semester that regular recordings of certain kinds of teaching sessions will not be made.Plan your recordings Before each lecture, inform students that the lecture is being recorded. Let them know about the placement of cameras and whether they will appear on the recording or not.Always use a microphone, and check to ensure that it works before you commence your recording.Ensure you know which aspects of any lecture are recorded, e.g. the slide presentation and your voice, your image, the students' images etc. Knowing this will influence how you make use of the recording as a resource. For example, you may ask students to undertake a learning activity that makes use of written notes that you add to a whiteboard during the lecture; however, if the recording has not picked up those notes, then students watching the recording later will not be able to undertake the task.If you plan your recordings to be used by distance students, then make sure that you record yourself speaking along with the slide presentation, at least at some point within the recording. Seeing their lecturer / tutor as they teach is especially important for students who will never meet their teachers in person or see their face in a live session.If you write notes as you speak during a lecture, make use of a document camera, as this will ensure that the students present in the live lecture as well as those watching the recording will see the notes, as you write them.If you use material created by someone else, make sure that you are using it appropriately, within the terms of the license for its use. Copyright at OtagoPlan when you will use the \u201cpause record\u201d button if parts of the lecture would be inappropriate to record (such as sensitive topics or small group discussions). You can also review the recording later and delete sections using the editing facilities in Echo360 before making the recording available to students.When students ask questions or are invited to speak during a lecture, remember to repeat each question/comment into the microphone before responding, and/or provide the student with the microphone to ensure that what is said is recorded audibly.You can help students to focus on the key areas for learning, by planning your recordings in ways that draw attention to essential details and minimise those of less importance. Editing recordings afterwards can achieve the same effect.Capitalise on the advantages of recordings Just as you would use textbooks or other kinds of resources, integrate recordings as another resource within your teaching plan. Plan learning activities that direct students to make use of recordings in ways that engage them actively, not only with the content of the recording but also with other students, to build their conceptual and practical knowledge.Take advantage of the self-paced nature of recordings: students can slow down, freeze, pause, speed up, fast-forward, and rewind recordings. Include prompts, either within the recording itself or within the description of the learning activity that makes use of the recording, to direct students' attention to video sections of particular importance and thus assist students in making the best use of the recording for their learning.Evaluate the impact Just as you would with any aspect of your teaching, reflect regularly on the possible impact of lecture recording or the absence of it on teaching and on learning. Some effects may be seen in areas of interaction and communication but also across broader aspects of the learning-teaching processes you structure within your paper.Be sure to include the experiences of students with disabilities and students for whom English is not a first language.Make gathering feedback from students and others, such as tutors, about their experiences of lecture recording an explicit part of your formal and informal teaching and course evaluation plans.Practice guidelines to help you structure your advice to studentsTailor the following to provide explicit guidance and advice to students about the use of recordings within your paper.Preparation, planning and getting ready for learning: A recording of a lecture or other session, such as a tutorial within any paper, is a learning resource.Try to attend your live lectures and use the recordings to supplement your learning and review.Use recordings to revisit information or explanation you missed or do not understand. A recording is not a substitute for class attendance.As with all learning resources, a lecture recording complements a lecture but does not replace it, so you cannot rely only on the recordings if you want to succeed in the paper.If you plan to use lecture recordings as one component of a disability support plan, discuss the plan with your lecturer so they are aware of your needs and can help you make the best use of the recordings.Look through the Course Outline for your paper to determine if lectures and other sessions will be recorded. If recordings are to be made, the Course Outline will also describe how you will be expected to use them, where to find them, when you can access them and how long the recordings will be available.If the Course Outline informs you that recordings are not to be made of some or all teaching activities, take note of the explanation about why this is to be the case. Ask your lecturer about alternatives should you miss classes due to work, family or health reasons.Watching recordings: If you cannot attend a live lecture, your Course Outline may have advice about when you should plan to watch the recording after the recording is released. If there are no direct guidelines about this in your Course Outline, then make sure that you watch the recording within a week of it being made available.If you are watching a recording because you were not able to be at the live lecture, watch it at normal speed and make notes, as you would in the live lecture. You can then use your notes when you go back to the recording later to review or engage in any learning activity that has been set.Watch the recordings or parts of the recordings with a study group and talk about them with the group. Learning together can enhance your understanding. If you are asked to undertake a learning activity using sections of the recording, consider working on the task with friends. (Of course, if the task is an assessment task that has to be undertaken individually, this approach would not be appropriate).Making the most of recordings to support your learning: To help with your revision or undertake an activity that your lecturer has instructed you to work on, make good notes during the live lecture and review them as you watch the recording.Use recordings to enhance your learning from the lecture. If you find you are having trouble understanding a concept or some other aspect of the recording, use the recording as a basis for asking for help from your lecturer, tutor or other students.Use the recordings to help you to focus your attention on what is essential. For example: pause the recording while you make notes;run the recording at a slower speed to hear or watch details that you may miss when running it at normal or higher speeds;freeze the video so that you can look closely at a diagram or set of points on display;rewind sections of the recording to help you to review ideas and other essential points, especially if there are some ideas that you have trouble understanding;fast-forward through sections you are confident about or to quickly find sections your lecturer has said are of particular importance or needed for a planned learning activity.Reflection and review: Be ready and willing to share your thoughts with your lecturer, tutor or Class Rep about how helpful or otherwise the recordings of the lectures are for your learning.Further readingBelow is a list of further reading regarding recording of lectures and how to use lecture recordings effectively: Cardall, S., Krupat, E., Ulrich, M.

The weight given to any factor will be measured against the duration of the leave and the resulting demands that the absence may place on that area. Factors that may be considered include:     \naccompanying a partner employed at the University who is undertaking research and study leave;\nWork experience, visiting fellowships or undertaking study, etc. in order to update or broaden skills and experience relevant to their current position;\ncompassionate grounds such as personal or family illness;\n\n\nLeave without pay of more than one year will be granted only in exceptional circumstances.\nFor the purpose of determining service based entitlements all periods of leave without pay are deemed to interrupt but not to break service.\nApproval of Leave without pay is made as follows:     \n\nTimeframe\nApproval required\n\n\n\nUp to 12 months\n\nDivisional Head (on recommendation of Head of Department) except for Health Sciences Division\nDeans (for Health Sciences Division)\n\n\n\n12 months and over\nStaffing Advisory Committee (on recommendation of Divisional Head, Dean (if applicable) and Head of Department)\n\n\n\n\nThe Application Form, or a letter which provides the same information, is required by the Divisional Head or Staffing Advisory Committee.\nFor leave without pay approved for less than 12 months, send the original of the application form to the Human Resources Division.

        "scope": "These guidelines apply to University of Otago Heads of Departments and staff engaged with or with financial oversight of externally funded research; and to University of Otago Heads of School, Heads of Programmes, Deans, Divisional Pro Vice-Chancellors and professional staff engaged in the support of externally funded research.\nThe guidelines support or supplement the information contained in the Administration of Externally Funded Research Policy and the Administration of Externally Funded Research Procedures, and are to be read in conjunction with those documents.",
        "content": "General PrinciplesIndirect costs, most generally for indirect salaries and overheads represent costs borne by the University in paying salaries, infrastructure and operational costs necessary to support the research activities for which external funding has been supplied.The Research and Enterprise Office is responsible for communicating the cost of overhead recoveries to funding bodies, and the University is accountable for the ways in which the funding is disbursed within the University in order to support the project(s) for which the funding was received.Research proposals should be costed as accurately and comprehensively as possible. Salary and overhead costs are real and amounts received to meet these costs should not be redeployed to directly support research activities that were not costed in the original research grant application.According to current University financial management principles, all revenue is recognised within the Cost Centre where it is generated, including the indirect cost recoveries for externally funded research.It is acknowledged that externally-funded research that does not contribute overheads within a Cost Centre is still important. It can help to support the wider strategic objectives of the Cost Centre and University, including enhancing the reputation of the University, supporting postgraduate research, and allowing pilot data to be generated for fully-costed research grant applications.Externally-funded research should not compromise academic freedom or critic-and-conscience responsibilities of our staff or students.Maintaining strategic funds within Cost Centre budgets is encouraged, and can help contribute to seeding or supporting research activities at departmental and divisional levels.Allocation of strategic funds within a Cost Centre or division, some of which may be derived from externally-funded research activities, should follow fair and transparent processes that are aligned with the strategic priorities of the Cost Centre, Division and University. Hence grant holders should not expect to receive direct funds from overheads or indirect salary recoveries.Indirect Salary RecoveriesIndirect salary recovery (ISR) revenues account for the time spent on specific externally-funded research activities for staff who are in continuing employment in roles that require research. This will include, for example, academic staff with duties that include teaching, research and service, as well as those employed on research-only contracts. The use of revenues derived from indirect salary recoveries shall follow the following principles:As Indirect Salary Recoveries are cost-recovery for salaries already committed, funding should not to go directly to the individual staff member, including as additional salary.Indirect salary recoveries are recognised as revenue in the Cost Centre where the staff member is employed, with an expectation that such revenue is a necessary component of full-cost-recovery research required to sustain a productive research environment in the unit (department, centre, school, division etc.). Direct 'buy out' from other activities for the funded staff member should therefore not be the first call on these funds when the staff member has capacity within their normal workload to undertake the research.When the total indirect salary recovery for an individual staff member exceeds their normal research time allocation, indirect salary recoveries should be used for direct 'buy out' of time from an allied activity. In such cases, the buy-out plan should be agreed and recorded with the Head of Department before applying for external funding.It may be strategic for the Cost Centre to 'buy in' additional teaching or support for a staff member or team's allied activities, allowing the particular time needed to undertake an externally funded research project to be dedicated. For example, 'buy in' may be used to support routine marking or assessment activities, or help with routine course coordination or administrative activities, to free up time to dedicate to fulfilling the contract with the research funder. Such arrangements need to be specified in writing and approved by the HoD prior to the application for research funding.At the discretion of the Head of Department, other 'buy in' or 'buy out' arrangements may be required to allow the externally-funded research to proceed, for example: if the research requires commitment at times that were incompatible with delivery of certain components of normal teaching (e.g. requiring a semester free of teaching commitments for fieldwork or other time-sensitive activities on the externally-funded project); if time needs to be protected for other necessary research activities outside the externally-funded project (e.g. maintaining long-term discipline-focused research or scholarship); and/or buy-out is required for the reallocation of teaching or other duties within the department's workload model to allow the externally-funded research to proceed.Overhead RecoveriesThe overhead recovery components of externally-funded research projects are calculated using a methodology that globally accounts for the real costs to the University of providing infrastructure, staffing and other support that is not directly costed to the project.Overhead recoveries are revenues earned principally to cover additional participation fees allocated through university and divisional cost drivers to the Cost Centre from the research activity itself. For example, some cost drivers are related to staff or student numbers, so additional staff or students funded through the activity will result in additional participation fees. Some other cost drivers are also directly related to the amount of external research funding received by a Cost Centre.Overhead recoveries also account for costs borne within a Cost Centre that are not directly allocated through internal cost drivers, as well as to contributing to the revenue needed to support indirect costs of research supported by funding received without overheads (such as funding received from charitable organisations).For commercial research or research that is funded with a profit margin built into the overhead recovery rate, the net profit after the application of overheads for internal cost drivers, is available for use at the discretion of the Cost Centre head, with any such use being subject to all other University financial policies and procedures.For large-scale activities (such as CoREs, NSCs, HRC and MBIE programmes) the overheads may be of such a nature that application to directly support staff or costs that would otherwise be allocated through cost drivers may be permissible (e.g. direct payment of space charges, facilities costs or the contribution to salaries of dedicated administrative staff allocated to support the activity through the relevant shared service), but will require agreement by the relevant Academic Divisional PVC and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) at the time of application for the funding.Strategic Funds to Support ResearchMany forms of university revenue, in addition to externally-funded research revenue, contribute to support research activity; this includes PBRF revenues, philanthropic donations, student tuition fees (to support the research-informed nature of the teaching) and student achievement component (SAC) funding from government. All of these income sources contribute to strategic funds that should be maintained over and above the direct- or indirectly-attributable costs of the activities themselves.Principles that should be considered when applying strategic funds to seed and support research are: All strategic research funds should be allocated through an open, fair and transparent process within the Cost Centre, School or Division. Allocation processes can be a mix of mechanisms that reward successful grant recipients, encourage early-career researchers to establish themselves for future grant applications, enhance M\u0101ori or Pacific research and seeding new collaborative or community-engaged research activities.Strategic fund allocation mechanisms must always link to departmental, school, divisional and university strategic imperatives. Strategic fund allocation policies, procedures must include diverse perspectives and decisions must be recorded and available for dissemination to Heads of Department, PVCs, Divisional and University Research Committees.Related policies, procedures and formsAdministration of Externally Funded Research PolicyAdministration of Externally Funded Research ProceduresExternally Sponsored Graduate Research ProceduresFinancial Delegations PolicyFinancial Delegations ProcedureFinancial Monitoring and Control PolicyResearch Consultation with M\u0101ori PolicyResponsible Practice in Research \u2013 Code of ConductSchedule of Financial Delegations\n\n\n                .register-container {\n                    display: flex;\n                    gap: 50px;   \n                }\n                .button--colour-primary-b {\n                    gap: 5px;   \n                }\n            ",

Principles\nAssessment of student performance at the University of Otago follows four principles: Assessments will centre on essential knowledge and skills.Assessment will be criterion-referenced; each student's work will be judged on its own merits with grades awarded on the basis of demonstrated achievement against established learning outcomes and standards.All internal assessment will have a formative component and inform learning.The workload associated with assessment requirements will be reasonable and the tasks will be fully described at the start of the paper to give students time to fit them in alongside their other commitments.\n2. Assessment Arrangements\nMost University papers will include a mix of internal assessment(s) and a final examination, but this pattern may be varied as appropriate to the learning outcomes of the paper (see also clause 4).Every University paper should include sufficient formative assessment to provide students with feedback to inform their learning.In each paper, students should receive specific, clear, and early information about what they need to do to pass the paper or to obtain a grade. The information should include details about the assessment criteria, format, timing, percentage weight and focus of each assessment, and should be available in the paper outline, on the learning management site and/or in other documents made available at the start of the paper. A summary of assessment should also be available to students considering enrolling in the paper, for example via a list of assessment tasks with percentage weightings in the paper supplementary information on the University website.Where an internal assessment test is held outside the scheduled meeting times for a paper (for instance, a single evening test for two or more lecture streams), the date, starting time and duration of the test should be announced at the first class and in the paper outline.Internally assessed work should not normally be due between the start of the last teaching week and the first day of examinations (except for a low-weight laboratory report from the previous week being submitted early in the last teaching week).If a paper has no final examination and all summative graded assessment is internal, then it may be reasonable for students to hand in the final assessment during the last week of teaching. It is recommended that, in these circumstances, an assessment task be worth less than 20% of the final grade, though that may be higher in postgraduate papers (e.g., where the final assignment is a culmination of the learning objectives, for example in the case of a research proposal).If a paper has no final examination, an internal assessment task may be submitted at any time during the examination period but with a deadline of the last day of examinations. Any final assessment must be marked and available to students before the deadline for confirming examination results for the relevant semester.Announced assessment arrangements in each paper may be changed only after consultation with students and approval by the Head of Department.Where changes to assessment arrangements impact a paper such that the content changes by 25% or more, a new paper proposal is required and should be submitted to the Academic Committee as appropriate. Significant changes to assessment arrangements that do not require a new paper proposal should be notified to the Head of Department and then to the relevant Divisional Academic Board.Procedures for Student Assessment in Te Reo M\u0101ori Refer to M\u0101ori Language Policy \u2013 Ng\u0101 Kaupapa m\u014d te reo M\u0101ori\n3. Penalties for Late Submitted Assignment\nUsing a late submission penalty is at the discretion of the paper convenor. Where used, information setting out the use of a late submission penalty must be included in the paper material provided to students.Where a late submission penalty is used, the standard penalty shall be 5% of the maximum mark per day late or part thereof. For example, if submitted up to 24 hours late, reduce available marks by 5%; 24-48 hours late, reduce available marks by 10% etc. Examples applying this Schedule include: An assignment is marked as 17/20 (20 marks being the maximum available marks). If this was submitted one day late, this mark is reduced by 5% of 20 (-.05 x 20 = -1), meaning that the final awarded mark is 16/20; if submitted two days late, the final awarded mark is 15/20 (-.10 x 20 = -2); if submitted three days late, the final awarded mark is 14/20 (-.15 x 20 = -3) etc.An assignment is marked as 25/40 (40 marks being the maximum available marks). If this was submitted one day late, this mark is reduced by 5% of 40 (-.05 x 40 = -2), meaning that the final awarded mark is 23/40; if submitted two dates late, the final awarded mark is 21/40 (-.10 x 40 = -4); if submitted three days late, the final assigned mark is 19/40 (-.15 x 40 = -6) etc. Penalty calculatorAll penalty timeframes are inclusive of weekends, public holidays, and university semester breaks and closure timesLate submitted assignments, without prior approved extensions, will not be accepted after the feedback on the assessment task has been returned to any student by the marker. Timeframes for returning marks should be provided to students in the course outline.Assignments submitted after seven days of the deadline, or after feedback is returned if this is less than seven days, also will not be marked.Requests for time extensions should normally be applied for prospectively (before the submission deadline), unless there are mitigating circumstances preventing that request being made (e.g., unable to submit the request due to hospital admission, sickness etc). Information regarding the extensions process should be included in the course outline. Approving retrospective extensions is at the discretion of the marker.\n4. Emphasis Given to the University Graduate Profile\nAssessment tasks should be aligned with the relevant graduate attributes in the University Graduate Profile.Assessment in all papers should give substantial weight to deeper learning (the development of conceptual understanding and skills in applying knowledge to new situations), while not neglecting to give credit for learning core factual material.In addition to short-term goals, assessment in all papers should give explicit emphasis to long-term goals such as synthesis of knowledge and the development of written and oral communication skills, research skills and thinking skills, thus better equipping graduates for lifelong learning.\n5. Relative Weights Given to Summative Internal Assessments and Final Examinations\nThe weights given to different summative assessment components included in final grades should reflect the stated learning outcomes of the paper. This is the central requirement for validity of the grades.The proportion of marks awarded through internal summative assessment should be in accord with the previous guideline 4(a). Given the diverse goals and teaching arrangements of different papers, this proportion can be expected to vary widely (up to and including one hundred percent summative internal assessment).Adjustment of internal summative assessment marks through the use of 'plussage' procedures may be appropriate for some assessment components in some papers. These components should be clearly identified in paper outlines.Only where good academic reasons exist should a specified level of result in the final examination be required to pass a paper. Students must be informed in the paper outline and in the first class should this requirement be part of the summative assessment.\n6. The Use of Terms as Mandatory Course Requirements\nTerms requirements, detailing minimum levels of attendance or experience required before a final examination can be sat or a final grade awarded, can be enforced where there is a clear pedagogical rationale. The requirements must be communicated clearly to all students to whom they apply. Students must be informed in the paper outline and in the first class should this requirement be part of the assessment.All summative assessment components included in final grades must reflect performance on paper objectives. It is not appropriate to give grading credit for attendance at class sessions.Where terms requirements are in force, procedures for monitoring compliance with the requirement should be thorough, with fairness further ensured through proper early warning and appeal procedures.\n7. Feedback on Student Work\nAssessment during the semester (including drafts of thesis chapters) should be returned with feedback as soon as practicable after the work was submitted, and normally no later than three teaching weeks after the day the work was due.In addition to receiving a grade, students should receive a clear indication of the strengths and weaknesses of their work, normally accompanied by guidance on how to perform the task or a similar task better, (excluding the final thesis copy for submission).Where one summative assessment task in a paper is dependent on another, the second task should not normally be due until at least one week after feedback has been provided on the first.If the internal assessment task is relevant to preparation for the final examination, feedback should be provided at least one week before the final examination.All internal assessment not relevant to the final examination should be marked and available to students before the day of the final examination.Feedback timeframes may vary in papers less than a standard semester in length (e.g. Summer School papers), but the principle of providing students with feedback in a timely manner so as to inform subsequent assessment tasks, including the final examination, should be adhered to.\n8. Summative Assessment of Group Work\nPerformance on group tasks is an acceptable component of student final grades. The percentage contribution from group tasks should be justifiable in terms of the objectives of the paper.If more than thirty percent of a final grade is associated with group tasks, before individual grades are finalised the teacher(s) should take account of additional information about the contributions of individuals to group task results.Instructions for students about how to successfully complete group tasks, expectations of the group, and conflict resolution procedures, should be available in the paper outline, on the learning management site and/or in other documents made available at the start of the paper.\n9. Oral Assessment\nOral assessment should be used selectively, where the oral format is particularly suited to the skills and students being assessed.Where oral assessments are to be used, students should be given clear information at the start of the paper about the purpose, nature and scope of the assessment. They should also be given organised opportunities to practice the skills involved.Formally arranged oral examinations should normally involve at least two examiners.\n10. Student Workload\nThe number of internal graded summative assessment tasks in each paper should be kept to a minimum consistent with the educational objectives for that paper.Departments and schools should attempt to spread the assessment load for students taking popular combinations of papers.\n11. Monitoring and Moderation Procedures\nStaff are encouraged to consult appropriate peers when setting assessment tasks and deciding how to grade student responses to tasks.Paper co-ordinators should ensure that tutors and demonstrators receive guidance and training for their assessment activities, and that these activities are monitored for consistency of standards and quality of feedback provided.Where two or more staff share marking of an assignment or examination question, efforts should be made to achieve consistency and monitor its attainment.Where students are offered a choice of examination questions, the comparability of marks awarded for the different options should be monitored, evaluated, and where necessary adjusted.Departments and programmes should develop coherent approaches to assessment, put in place processes to ensure that assessment is appropriate and matched to expected learning outcomes, and examine assessment practices across their papers.Departments and professional schools should review obtained grades in papers before finalising marks, making adjustments where appropriate. While marks should not be fitted to pre-determined grade distributions or pass rates, it may be appropriate to treat mark/grade distributions as one factor to be considered when finalising marks.External moderation prior to the finalisation of marks is required for papers (including research projects and dissertations) that contribute to final year Honours, Postgraduate Certificate, Postgraduate Diploma, Master's, and Master's coursework programmes.The Academic Committee will monitor the appropriateness of assessment arrangements in the design of new and significantly altered papers.\n12. Academic Staff Development\nHeads of Departments should ensure that all academic staff are familiar with the University of Otago Teaching and Learning Plan (and Divisional and Departmental plans) and these guidelines before beginning teaching and assessment, or designing new papers.Heads of Departments should ensure that all tutors or demonstrators receive training before undertaking assessment of student work.The Higher Education Development Centre (HEDC) will provide opportunities for new and established academic staff members to discuss assessment practices and enhance their assessment skills and procedures.HEDC will arrange sessions that will help staff become familiar with the provisions of these guidelines and their justification.",

Overview\nThe primary focus of establishing a jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme is to facilitate co-operative research and/or scholarly collaboration between the University of Otago and a domestic or international partner institution.\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that these programmes are not provided simply to facilitate national or international study for postgraduates.The process for applying to establish a jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme is rigorous and best started well in advance of a student's intended commencement date. Departments are required to discuss the proposed programme extensively with the department in the proposed partner institution(s).Normally, a Memorandum of Understanding would be established with the partner institution(s) prior to any jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme being developed. This process is facilitated by the International Office, and the discussions may take several months.A Candidature Agreement must be developed in consultation with the Graduate Research School (for doctoral candidates) or Divisional Offices (for Masters' candidates). Given the liaising that needs to occur between institutions, several weeks should be allowed for this process.\n2. Areas of responsibility\nThe International Office facilitates discussions regarding establishing Memoranda of Understanding with proposed international partner institutions.The Graduate Research School, in consultation with relevant Divisional and Departmental Offices, facilitates discussions regarding developing Candidature Agreements for doctoral candidates.The Divisional Offices, in consultation with the Graduate Research School, facilitate discussions regarding developing Candidature Agreements for Master's candidates.\n3. Eligibility\nApproval for jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programmes will only be given for cases where it can be clearly established that a strong collaborative link with the partner institution(s) already exists or is actively being developed.Prospective candidates must satisfy the usual criteria for entry to the University of Otago postgraduate programme, and must apply for admission in the usual way.\u00a0\u00a0Both international and domestic candidates are eligible to participate in the jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programmes.\n4. Funding\nFor candidates whose lead institution is the University of Otago: Candidates must enrol and pay tuition fees at the University of Otago for each year of their study, even if they are studying at a partner institution in a given year.Candidates may be enrolled for a degree or under another enrolment status at partner institutions, and may be charged administrative and/or tuition fees by those institutions. If the partner institution is a New Zealand institution, the candidate cannot be formally enrolled at the partner institution.International and domestic candidates can stay up to half-time at a partner institution, but see (iv).To be eligible for PhD domestic fees at the University of Otago, international candidates, New Zealand permanent residents and Australian citizens intending to study overseas must spend no more than one year at the international partner institution, and only for research-related reasons (i.e. research activities they cannot conduct in New Zealand).Both international and domestic candidates will be able to apply for postgraduate scholarship support through the University of Otago.The University of Otago receives Student Achievement Component funding and PBRF completion funding.For candidates whose partner institution is the University of Otago: Candidates will enrol for a Certificate of Proficiency, and be recorded in the University's Visiting Student System (\u201cSojourn\u201d).Candidates may be charged administrative fees (if applicable) as well as tuition fees.Candidates are not eligible for postgraduate scholarship support through the University of Otago.International candidates will be covered by the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International StudentsThe University of Otago will not receive any Student Achievement Component funding for international candidates.The University of Otago will not receive any PBRF completion funding.\n5. Enrolment, administration and examination\nCandidates wishing to be enrolled at the University of Otago in a jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme must apply for candidature in the normal way and will be enrolled in the relevant course code.Candidates' programmes of study will be administered in accordance with the University of Otago regulations governing the particular programme and any specific arrangements laid out in the candidature agreement.The examination arrangements must meet the University of Otago requirements, and the candidature agreement should cover any additional requirements the partner institutions may have and ensure that the procedures for examination are clearly understood by all parties including the individual candidate.\n6. Graduation and degree certificate\nCandidates graduating from a jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme are only allowed to attend graduation at the lead institution and may only receive one award certificate from the lead institution. The student transcript there may contain a statement saying that this degree was taught in conjunction with the partner institution.Providing notification to the Graduation Office, any supervisor(s) from the partner university can attend the graduation ceremony as part of the academic staff.\n7. Application process\nHeads of Department/Schools are encouraged to informally discuss proposals with the Dean of the Graduate Research School. Given that the main requirement for approval of these programmes is that they serve to form a viable and desirable link, it is best to seek advice from the Dean of the Graduate Research School and the Director of International (if for an international partnership) as to the viability of the proposal prior to approaching another institution. Following these informal discussions, if the partnership looks viable, a formal application may be lodged.For partnerships with overseas institutions, the formal application must include: a proposal to establish a partnership (unless this is already existing);a copy of the MOU between the institutions; and,a candidature agreement.For partnerships with New Zealand institutions: a candidature agreement.",

Instead, it appears to be part of a larger set of policies related to graduate research degrees and coursework masters' degrees.\n\n2. **Inconsistent scope**: The scope of the policy seems inconsistent across different sections. For example, in Section 1 (Introduction), the scope is limited to \"jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programs.\" However, in Section 6 (Graduation and degree certificate), the scope expands to include \"degree programs\" without specifying whether it's exclusively joint programs.\n\n3. **Unclear policy hierarchy**: The policies do not clearly outline their relationship with other relevant policies or procedures. This makes it difficult to determine which policies supersede others or have priority in case of conflicting requirements.\n\n4. **Repetition of similar information**: Sections 4 (Funding) and 5 (Graduation and degree certificate) contain similar information, such as the requirement for candidates to receive an award certificate from the lead institution. This repetition can be confusing and may be unnecessary.\n\n5. **Lack of clear decision-making process**: The policies do not outline a clear decision-making process for establishing jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programs. This makes it unclear who is responsible for making decisions, how those decisions are made, and what factors influence those decisions.\n\n6. **Insufficient consideration for appeals or exceptions**: The policies do not provide clear procedures for appealing or seeking exceptions to the rules or guidelines outlined in the policy. This may leave room for confusion or disputes among stakeholders.\n\n7. **Lack of review or revision process**: The policies do not outline a clear review or revision process, which is essential for ensuring that policies remain relevant, effective, and up-to-date.\n\n8. **Inconsistent language usage**: As mentioned earlier, there is inconsistent language usage throughout the policies.

Appointments will be made using the approved role descriptions.The Guidelines outline the criteria and level of Support Fund and FTE relief to be applied across all Divisions.Divisional Associate Dean positions will be funded by the Division.\n2. Appointment Process\nAppointment of a Divisional Associate Dean is approved by the Vice-Chancellor on the recommendation of the Pro-Vice-Chancellor.When recommending a Divisional Associate Dean appointment, the Pro-Vice-Chancellors should consider the following: the standardised generic role descriptions for Divisional Associate Deansthe Division-specific tasks and responsibilities, andthe FTE allocation appropriate for each Divisional Associate Dean role based on: the extra tasks required for a Divisionthe size of the Division and hence the quantum of work requiredthe extent of the administrative support from the Division for the role.Divisional Associate Dean appointments should be for an initial 3-year term. A further term or terms can be awarded. However, the total tenure of a Divisional Associate Dean will not normally exceed six years.Succession planning should, where possible, commence at least six months before the next Divisional Associate Dean commences.\n3. Associate Dean FTE allowance and FTE\nThe Pro-Vice-Chancellor will, in consultation with the relevant Academic Head to determine the type and extent of support and/or FTE relief.This will normally take the form of a specific reduction in the appointee's normal FTE to allow a reasonable allocation of time to perform their Divisional Associate Dean responsibilities.\n4. Departmental FTE Relief Principles:\nFTE relief is the amount of time a Divisional Associate Dean is allocated to undertake their Associate Dean role. This normally leads to an equivalent reduction in FTE in their normal academic role.Considerations for determining whether the departmental FTE will be reduced and if so, the extent of reduction will include: their current FTEthe breakdown of their teaching, research & service.Up to 0.2 FTE of a Divisional Associate Dean position will normally be considered as constituting the majority of the person's service component, except for professional service. This means the Divisional Associate Dean will do minimum service work for the home department.The freed-up departmental funds are to be used by the department to backfill the department's service requirements.The Division will fund the provision of FTE relief for Divisional Associate Dean positions.The relief funds can be used by the Head of Department to compensate for the reduction in departmental FTE. Examples include back filling the Divisional Associate Dean's service and teaching or funding research assistance.Where the Divisional Associate Dean is required to continue their departmental service, the Divisional Associate Dean will be given appropriate up to 0.2 FTE relief from teaching or research by the home department. That relief will normally be a 50/50 split between teaching and research.Where Divisional Associate Dean roles are more than 0.2 FTE, the released funds should be used by the home department to allow relief from departmental teaching and research (normally 50/50 split). Departmental service is expected to be a minimum.The minimum Research is 0.2 FTE and minimum Teaching is 0.2 FTE (unless specified in an employment contract).\n5. Divisional Associate Dean Support Funds:\nThe appointee to a Divisional Associate Dean role will be considered for an allocation of funds (\u201cthe Support Fund\u201d) to support their teaching and research activities.The use of the Support Fund will be determined after discussions between the Divisional Associate Dean, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor and the Head of Department.The Pro-Vice-Chancellor will approve the amount and usage of the Support Fund.The Support Fund will be scaled depending on the FTE.The Divisional Associate Dean will report annually on the usage of their fund to the Pro-Vice-Chancellor.The Support Fund cannot be paid as income to the Divisional Associate Dean.",

However, it would be beneficial to clarify what exactly is excluded from this scope (e.g., are certain areas within buildings still subject to these guidelines?).\n\n3. **Overly broad definitions**: The policy defines \"commercial activities\" broadly, stating that they will normally only be approved where they are part of an event meeting specific criteria (2(a) and 2(b)). However, the policy does not provide clear guidance on what constitutes a commercial activity in this context.\n\n4. **Lack of standardization**: The locations suitable for private use include multiple options, but it would be helpful to have a more standardized or list-based format for specifying these areas, rather than relying on parenthetical comments.\n\n5. **Unclear conflict resolution process**: While the policy mentions that conflicts with other activities may lead to the University's needs taking precedence, it does not provide clear guidance on how such conflicts should be resolved or escalated.\n\n6. **Potential for ambiguity in risk assessment**: The policy references a risk assessment process, but it is unclear what specific factors or criteria would be considered when evaluating the potential risks associated with an event.\n\n7. **Limited clarity on approval process**: While the policy mentions that approval may be granted or denied based on various factors, it does not provide clear guidance on how to initiate or follow up on these requests.\n\n8. **No apparent standardization of communication channels**: The policy references multiple departments and individuals (e.g., Property Manager, Vice-Chancellor, Registrar), but it is unclear what the standard protocol is for communicating with these parties or escalating concerns.\n\n9. **Lack of clarity on fees**: While the policy mentions that commercial activities may be charged a fee by the Property Management Unit, it does not provide clear guidance on what this fee would cover, how it would be calculated, or when payment would be due.\n\nThese are some potential inconsistencies or structural flaws in the provided policy data.",

        "content": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Overview\nThe University of Otago encourages publishing during candidature for a doctorate, and the inclusion of published material and/or work submitted for publication in theses where appropriate. Such published material must have been prepared during the candidate's enrolment in the research degree.If candidates are planning to include published material in a thesis, they should discuss the most appropriate format for this with their supervisors. Practices differ across academic disciplines and it is important to obtain advice from experts within the relevant discipline.Two formats are commonly used for including published material in a University of Otago thesis: a hybrid thesis format, whereby published material is inserted either wholly or partially as chapters or sections in the thesis (usually with modification \u2013 see 2(a) below; ora thesis with publications appended, whereby published material is not included in the body of the thesis but is appended to the thesis in an unmodified format.For the PhD and professional doctorates, the University of Otago does not offer a formal \u201cthesis by publication\u201d option, whereby the thesis is composed solely of a portfolio of publications.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thesis requirements\nThe thesis must be an integrated and coherent body of work. It may be necessary to alter the format of published materials for inclusion in the thesis, including standardising formatting and/or deleting duplicated material.Publications included sequentially may need to be linked by short bridging sections.If the hybrid thesis contains multiple publications, candidates need to ensure that they have: provided an introductory chapter to the thesis that gives some background context and rationale for the research, as well as describing the structure of the thesisdemonstrated their ability to critically engage with the literature, which may mean including a chapter (or substantive sections) critically reviewing the literaturecarefully considered their research design and justified choices of methodology and methods where necessary, which may mean including a chapter (or substantive sections) on research designsynthesised and discussed the findings from the publications, which may necessitate including a discussion chapter (or substantive sections).Where published material is included, the thesis must include a \u201cCo-authorship Form\u201d placed after the thesis abstract.It is expected that for any published material presented in the body of the thesis, the candidate will be a lead author.It is the candidate's responsibility to ensure that any published work (or parts thereof) included in the thesis comply with copyright provisions and that any guidelines with regard to self-citation are followed.\u00a0\u00a0More information on copyright is available on the University of Otago Library Thesis Information webpage.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examination of the thesis\nThe inclusion of published material in a thesis does not guarantee a pass in the degree for which the thesis is submitted. The thesis must stand on its own merits and will be assessed as a single document. Examiners may require changes to any part of the thesis regardless of whether that material has been previously published or not.All aspects of the thesis including publications and appendices are examinable and may be raised at an oral examination. For example, if a co-author of an included publication conducted some analyses, the candidate may be required to answer questions regarding those analyses.",

        "content": "1. Overview\nThese Guidelines outline the criteria and amount of the Allowance and Support Fund to be applied across all Divisions.Each Head will be allocated a specific package based on the number of FTE staff employed in a calendar year who directly or indirectly report to that Head.The allocation is based on the principle that leading a larger department places greater demand on the Head's time.\n2. Allocation Structure\nThere are four levels of FTE ranges (Bands). Each has a different package as outlined in the table below. Band Level FTE rangeAllowance Support Fund Total Package\n           1 \n        \n           0 to 9 \n        \n           $10,000 \n        \n           $15,000 \n        \n           $25,000 \n        \n           2 \n        \n           10 to 24 \n        \n           $10,000 \n        \n           $20,000 \n        \n           $30,000 \n        \n           3 \n        \n           25 to 49 \n        \n           $15,000 \n        \n           $25,000 \n        \n           $40,000 \n        \n           4 \n        \n           50 plus \n        \n           $15,000 \n        \n           $35,000 \n        \n           $50,000 \n        Decisions on which band level a Head is placed in will be based on the FTE figure relevant to that Head for the previous calendar year.After each calendar year the FTE will be re-calculated, the package reviewed and altered where appropriate.Where a Head is responsible for two or more departments, the FTE of those departments will be totalled up and Allowance and Support Fund will be allocated accordingly. The Head will not normally receive a separate package for each department.The Allowance and Support Fund will be allocated as a proportion of the Head's total FTE.The University may from time to time review the FTE ranges for each band.Heads who were appointed prior to the implementation date of these guidelines will either retain their current package or receive an increase if the Allowance and/or Support Fund rates are higher in the Band relevant for their department.If there is a significant organisational change to a department during a year, the FTE and Allowance and Support Fund will be re-assessed. Where there is a current Head then the principles in (g) above will apply.\n3. Allowance\nThe Allowance is taxable income paid directly to the Head. It is excluded from superannuation.\n4. Support Fund\nA Support Fund is provided to support the Head's research.\u00a0\u00a0The Head may use this Support Fund within the criteria outlined below.Heads must submit a Support Fund budget plan to the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or Dean in Health Sciences) annually, for approval of how the Support Fund is to be used.The Head will make a case to demonstrate that the use of the Support Fund will be of benefit to their research programme. Examples of how the Support Fund may be used include: Provision of research assistance or teaching relief, such as short-term employment of a research assistant or teaching fellow for high workload periods or specific one-off tasks/projects.Purchase or rental of equipment that would not normally be available to the Head that would provide time release.Attendance at conferences and courses both within New Zealand and internationally.Visits to overseas universities and institutions to keep up to date with trends in the academic area.It is acknowledged that use of the Support Fund will vary across Departments and Divisions depending on circumstances and requirements of each individual Head.The Support Fund cannot be used to supplement existing Departmental budgets for general purposes or as a source of discretionary funds.Pro-Vice-Chancellors and Deans in Health Sciences will be required to ensure equity and consistency in the ways in which Support Funds are managed.Once the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or Dean in Health Sciences) has approved how the Support Fund will be used, the Head may use the Support Fund within that agreed plan.The plan and expenditure can be altered at any time during the year following agreement between the Head and the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Dean in Health Sciences.Unspent Support Funds do not carry forward into the next calendar year, i.e., they will not accrue from year to year.",

Each degree will be either a terminating qualification or provide two pathways, one terminating and one that can be a route to PhD study.Inclusion of a research component is not mandatory.

However, without explicit words like \"see policy X\", it's subjective.\n3. **Inconsistent formatting**: The policy data is structured consistently, but some content appears to be formatted as separate lines or indented text. Consider using a consistent formatting style throughout the document.\n4. **Lack of clear categorization**: Some policies appear to contain procedures or guidelines that could be categorized differently (e.g., \"Guidelines_for_the_Introduction_of_Coursework_180_point_Masters_Degrees\" and its associated responses). Consider creating separate categories for different types of policies (e.g., Guidelines, Procedures, etc.).\n5. **Unclear scope**: The scope of the policy appears to be somewhat ambiguous. For example, what constitutes \"a maximum of three semesters\"? Consider adding more clarity or specificity to this section.\n6. **No clear exit criteria**: While there is a mention of an \"exit qualification\" for programs exceeding one calendar year in duration, there is no clear outline of what this entails or how it will be implemented.\n\nOverall, while the policy data appears well-structured and easy to follow, there are some areas where redundancy, inconsistency, and potential for improvement can be addressed.",

The most common postgraduate cohort undertaking such travel are doctoral and, to a lesser extent, masters' research students. It is possible that some coursework masters' students and postgraduate certificate or diploma students could undertake travel overseas for research-related purposes, and if so, they should follow these guidelines.",

Ensuring necessary compliance\nFor research overseas as part of doctoral or master's study, students must seek approval from the Graduate Research School (for doctoral students) or, for master's students, from the Divisional or Departmental Office as appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0The Change of Research Details form should be completed and returned to the appropriate office for approval. Change of Research Details form (PDF)In order to get approval for overseas research, postgraduate students must complete, and have signed by their supervisor and Head of Department/School, a copy of the Postgraduate Travel Overseas Research and Safety Plan. Once completed, the Plan must be uploaded to the student's file in eVision.In order for international PhD students to continue to pay domestic tuition fees, they are allowed to be temporarily overseas for research-related reasons for up to one year in total during their doctoral study.\u00a0\u00a0Note that writing-up of the thesis is not normally a valid research-related reason for being overseas.If required, ethics approval must be in place before collecting any data overseas. Note that it may be necessary for approval to also be obtained from the host institution and/or local agency.If appropriate, consultation with M\u0101ori must be undertaken before collecting any data overseas.\n2. Ensuring necessary travel documentation is obtained\nThe student should have a passport which is valid for more than six months after they return to New Zealand.The necessary visas should have been obtained for the research.Any access agreements to land/buildings/spaces must be obtained prior to data collection.The relevant authorities in the host country should be informed of the study and researchers should comply with any local requirements, for example, research permit, ethical review, research sponsor, etc.\n3. Consideration of travel safety issues\nIn the Postgraduate Travel Overseas Research and Safety Plan, possible risks should be identified and categorised, and the steps being taken to mitigate them outlined. These should include risks in the fieldwork as well as risks associated with accommodation and food.Where relevant, details should be provided of any safety equipment that is to be taken into the field.Students should be aware that they always retain the right to withdraw from all or part of any fieldwork activity, without question, when they consider their physical, emotional and/or cultural safety may be compromised.\n4. Contact details\nIn the Plan, details should be provided for how often and by what means (e.g., email, telephone, Skype or face-to-face meetings) the student will make contact with their supervisor and/or departmentEmergency contact information for the student must be entered.Contact details for any local support should be given\n5. Consideration of medical issues\nAny relevant existing medical conditions should be outlined in the Plan, together with how travel/fieldwork might impact on them and how these will be managed.If appropriate, students are advised to consult Student Health or their personal doctor at least two months before travelling to check on appropriate medications or inoculations.Any recommended immunisations should be detailed, together with commentary regarding whether they will or will not be obtained (and if the latter why not). Note that the immunisations will not normally be paid for by the University.\n6. Ensuring travel insurance is obtained\nThe level of risk for the travel both in terms of safety and medical reasons must be ascertained prior to departure: For travel to a high risk country, permission is required from the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor. The application should include the security advice recommended by ISOS , together with an explanation of how those risks will be mitigated.For travel to an extreme risk country the approval of the Vice-Chancellor is required.It is mandatory for students to have insurance when travelling overseas on University business (including research activities). Where students' activities are covered by a University grant, the grant is to be used to meet the insurance costs. Three options are available: Corporate Travel Insurance PolicyStudentsafe OutboundUnder some specific circumstances, international students who are insured under Studentsafe Inbound University may have limited cover while undertaking short-term study or research activities in Australia, Bali, Lombok, the Islands of the South Pacific, or in their country of origin. International students who intend to use their Studentsafe Inbound insurance to cover their overseas study activities are advised to check the policy wording to understand cover or discuss their eligibility and understanding of this cover with International Compliance Services.",

        "name": "Seismic_Guidelines",
        "scope": "These guidelines apply to all University-owned and leased properties covered by the Seismic Policy as managed by Property Services.",
        "content": "These guidelines support the Seismic Policy to enable risk-based decisions to be made in respect of the built environment. This document is intended for use by the University of Otago (University), Property Services Division (PSD), and Campus Development Division (CDD) staff and consultants\nThe guidelines cover:\nProcuring new buildings for acquisitionSeeking a seismic assessment of an existing building as instructed by the relevant Territorial Authority under the EPB MethodologyUndertaking due diligence of a building for business case purposes i.e., plans to undertake a capital project, improvement, demolition, or upgradeSeeking a seismic assessment to occupy a buildingTarget strengthening requirements of existing buildings, or parts of buildings, where required\nGeneralThe University owns, occupies, and operates a large property portfolio in New Zealand and accordingly has a risk based, strategic asset management approach to its portfolio. As the University is a long-term owner-occupier for a significant portion of its property portfolio, the University adopts a holistic approach to achieving the appropriate balance regarding the level of design specification, maintenance requirements, refurbishment and upgrading within the overarching framework of the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC). This applies to resilience, costs, and speed of repair in response to a seismic event.These guidelines advise:The level of seismic resilience to be achieved in new buildsHow to quantify and ensure sufficient seismic resilience in any property acquisition (owned or leased)How to quantify and increase the seismic resilience of existing propertiesNew buildingsEarly decisions in the design of new buildings can greatly improve or detract from the building's seismic performance Well-conceived, well-designed and well-constructed buildings will perform better than other code compliant buildings.The University requires the design of all new buildings to consider whole of building seismic performance. This includes structural, non-structural, and seismic restraint considerations. The whole design team must agree and adopt a 'whole of building' seismic performance approach and agree on appropriate design parameters. The project specific approach adopted is to be agreed with the Seismic Assessment Steering Group. Once agreed, these design parameters become performance requirements in addition to those of the NZBC.Site Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment The University requires design teams to consult with the NZBC and/or NZ Standards and to consider undertaking a Site-Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment for all major projects. This is to ensure the design incorporates the latest seismic hazard information, and an appropriate amount of future proofing. The New Zealand National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) is subject to major updates, so specific seismic hazard assessments will need to capture and apply the key components of the latest NSHM at the time the Site-Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment is completed.Importance level The minimum requirements for Importance Level (IL) of the Building Act are to be met. The importance level is to be agreed with the Seismic Assessment Steering Group at concept design stage.Regularity At concept stage the architect is required to work with the structural engineer to conceive a structurally 'regular' building to improve seismic performance. The University requires building configurations with a continuous lateral load-resisting path with little or no irregularities and seeks buildings with regular distribution of mass and stiffness in plan and elevation. Where irregularities are unavoidable, during the concept design phase the design team must present to the University the reasons why such irregularities are unavoidable and the mitigations for review and approval.Limit states, ductility and displacements It is recognised that NZBC compliant buildings are designed to deliver life safety and basic amenity but not necessarily asset protection. At concept stage the design team is to agree Limit state performance, global ductility and building flexibility. When considering these parameters, secondary structure, fa\u00e7ade, seismic restraint, and ceiling/partition performance and costs are to be considered. Generally, the University prefers low ductility systems that are detailed for ductility for capacity design principles, and low displacement designs.Low damage design Low damage design concepts and philosophy are to be considered by design teams and the University at briefing stage. Guidance on low damage design can be found in the MBIE low damage design project or the Ministry of Education requirement for Service Limit State 2 (SLS 2) load cases in the structural and geotechnical requirements document.Peer review All significant capital works projects require an independent peer review. The peer reviewer should be engaged early to agree the concept/preliminary design. The scope of the peer review is to include both a regulatory review to support building consent and conformance with the University's performance requirements.Non-structural elements including building services In addition to meeting mandatory requirements, a holistic approach to the restraint of services and non-structural elements is required from the design team. This is to ensure that efficient restraint provisions and seismic clearances are included from the onset and that for the completed building, damage and remedial work requirements following a seismic event, are reduced to a practicable minimum. To this end design teams shall, during the briefing and concept design stages, consider the following: The location of main services routes/corridors, both horizontal and vertical and their coordination with structure and architecture to facilitate efficient (potentially common) restraint provisions and to ensure adequate spatial allowance including necessary seismic clearances.How and from what structural elements, services and other non-structural elements will be supported and restrained.How differential movement between services and penetrated elements can be reduced, especially where services penetrate fire separations, to reduce damage and remedial work requirements following a seismic event.Ensuring that restraint provisions do not prevent the operation of antivibration measures and allow for necessary thermal expansion and contraction (of heating pipework for example). Restraint of building services and other key equipment shall meet the University's business continuity and asset protection requirements. Some University facilities will be \u201cmission-critical\u201d or have a post-disaster function dependent on the avoidance of serious damage, or the ability for timely return to service, of key building services plant and systems. For other facilities with high-value central plant or scientific/healthcare equipment, the consequence of serious equipment damage in a relatively minor seismic event will far outweigh the additional cost of restraints with enhanced seismic performance. The types of systems and equipment, and the appropriate serviceability limit states, shall be identified in the adopted project specific approach the Seismic Assessment Steering Group.Seismic assessmentsSeismic assessments are to be of appropriate complexity and accuracy to fulfil the purpose. Seismic assessments must only be carried out by suitably qualified and trained CPEng structural engineers. When considering the type of assessment required figure 1 below should be used.The University would rather invest in appropriate building upgrade costs (including necessary design analysis) rather than sophisticated assessments that give a degree of accuracy not necessarily warranted at assessment stage.Figure 1.Image descriptionAssessment methodology Where assessments are in response to a territorial authority request for earthquake prone building status then the MBIE's chief executive methodology must be used (Red Book). In other situations, the University may require other methodologies to be used. Generally, this will be the NZSEE \u2013 Seismic Assessment of Existing Buildings (yellow book) but could be other recognised systems such as FEMA P58. Where a methodology outside of the MBIE guidelines is used this should be agreed in advance with the University.Initial Seismic Assessment (ISA) Where the consultant is confident that an ISA will pick up the issues/potential issues with a building and that the score is sufficiently accurate, ISA s maybe carried out. Noting figure 1 above the effort, cost and reliability of an ISA is a continuum. The consultant is to make efforts to access drawings when completing an ISA .Detailed Seismic Assessment (DSA) Where the building warrants a more thorough analysis, a DSA is to be undertaken.Peer review Seismic assessments that give unexpected results, indicate a score that triggers a significant occupancy review or indicate a significant re-strengthening project are to be considered to have preliminary status until they have been independently peer reviewed. An independent peer review shall be determined by the Director Campus Development or Director Property Services on a case-by-case basis.Occupation assessmentIt is policy to act responsibly with respect to safety of life for students, staff, and visitors to the University. The University Seismic Policy requires buildings with a rating less than 20 per cent to have a risk assessment carried out. This risk assessment will inform decisions on occupancy. The occupancy/risk assessment is to include:Importance Level If the activities that occur within the building are driving the Importance Level (IL), then the IL can be reduced when undertaking an occupancy assessment. This is in order to undertake an occupancy assessment on life safety risk rather than post-disaster operations. This will be determined by the Seismic Programme Steering Group.Hazard description/collapse description The Occupation Assessment is to provide more commentary on the Assessment Outcome information required in both the ISA and DSA Assessment Summary Report Template obtained from the EQ-Assess website: Templates \u2013 EQ-Assess Specifically identified structural weaknesses and locations are to be identified. The mode of failure and physical consequences statement is to describe how the weakness will fail, which areas will be affected by failure/falling objects and any likely subsequent failures/vulnerabilities as a result of this failure. This commentary is to be presented to the Seismic Assessment Steering Group in writing and also presented orally to ensure it is fully understood and allow questions so informed decisions to be made.Hazard management options In addition to hazard identification, the Occupation Assessment is to give options to control the hazard. The University wants to understand the options to ultimately eliminate the hazard but pragmatic short-term options that allow reduced or limited occupancy via engineering controls must be considered. Options may include staging of strengthening works to deal with issues that can be readily and quickly rectified, barricading off an area, limiting use of the building if that lowers the importance level or providing temporary propping/restraint to elements. The University requires this information to be presented in a table similar to below: Engineering statement of structural weaknesses and location Mode of failure and physical consequence statement(s) Hazard control options Type of control (eliminate, substitute, engineering, etc.)\n                Weakness 1\n              \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n                Weakness 2\n              \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seismic strengtheningWhere the seismic programme indicates strengthening is required on non-heritage buildings, the following guidance will be considered:Seismic strengthening work will be focused to provide the best overall improvements in life safety for students, staff, and visitors to the University. PSD will develop a programme to improve the seismic performance of the property portfolio. This will be endorsed by the Asset Management Committee and used to inform the Long-Term Capital Plan for the University.All strengthening work shall be considered in conjunction with the Strategic Asset Management Plan and Long-Term Capital Plan and other planned maintenance or alterations to the building.Seismic strengthening shall achieve at least 67 per cent NBS but aim for 100 per cent where practical. Exceptions to the 67 per cent NBS target can only be made in accordance with the University Seismic Policy.Strengthening shall address any severe structural weaknesses (SSW) as defined by the MBIE guidelines. Any proposed strengthening should not alter the load distribution such that other elements become critical at less than 67 per cent, or other Critical Structural Weaknesses (CSW) are introduced.Urgent strengthening work may target 34 per cent NBS as an interim strengthening step where appropriate.Where a significant capital investment is proposed, seismic strengthening shall be independently peer reviewed in accordance with the University Seismic Guidelines.Where a significant capital investment is proposed, a site-specific seismic hazard study should be undertaken to ensure future proofed outcome.Where building parts (e.g., chimneys, parapets, etc.) constitute a seismic risk, these may be strengthened or removed in isolation ahead of a comprehensive strengthening scheme. Guidance such as the MBIE \u201cSecuring parapets and facades on unreinforced masonry buildings\u201d should be considered. Loads should be transferred to the primary lateral system in such upgrades. Where a staged upgrade is proposed, the consultant team shall ensure the University understands the short, and long-term performance.Where seismic strengthening is undertaken, a post completion DSA or \u201cfinal\u201d assessment will be provided by the Structural Engineer to the Project Manager, confirming the level to which the building was strengthened, noting this may differ from the design target.Heritage buildingsAll heritage buildings are to have their heritage status considered in seismic strengthening designs.Strengthening designs should aim to minimise any potential heritage loss and should aim to create the least visual impact on the building. Technology or techniques yet to be developed may provide a better solution in the future.The durability of strengthening elements should match the likely life of the building where elements cannot be easily removed or replaced.Where the building is on the New Zealand Heritage List, the University shall engage a Heritage Architect to prepare a conservation report to inform the strengthening, with consideration given to likely strengthening techniques. A resource consent will likely be required in most cases.Where the building is identified as a \u201cCharacter-Contributing Building\u201d within the Dunedin City Council (DCC) District Plan (2GP) consultation with the DCC is required to confirm the protected building parts and approach to strengthening. A resource consent may be required.ReferencesFEMA P-58-1: Seismic Performance Assessment of Buildings, Volume 1 \u2013 Methodology, Second EditionThe Seismic Assessment of Existing Buildings \u2013 EQ-AssessDealing with earthquake-related health and safety risks: information for PCBUs and building owners \u2013 Worksafe",

        "scope": "Applies to all staff and students who produce scholarly outputs or other works with high potential for consumption and reuse by the public or other researchers. Predominantly this will apply to peer-reviewed research publications, particularly journal articles, but may extend to any element of the academic endeavour, including theses, books, book chapters, monographs, conference proceedings and other works, such as software, data, teaching resources, information sheets or other written outputs.",
        "content": "PreambleOpen Access is one element to be considered alongside many others in an overall research and publication strategy. Aligning with the University's Open Access Policy, the following guidelines are intended to provide staff and students with a practical framework within which to achieve the maximum reach and impact of their scholarly work.These guidelines may be applied to any element of the scholarly work of staff and students, though it is expected that they will apply mainly to research publications, i.e. scholarly articles or monographs. However, other work to which these guidelines may apply includes research data, teaching resources, conference papers, software, and so on.Consider potential issues relating to open access at the outset of researchFor some researchers, releasing information and data from their research openly is a fundamental principle and they will build this thinking into their project planning, research data management, ethics application, permissions sought from participants, and so on. However, all researchers need to be aware that, in certain disciplines, funders and publishers are increasingly requiring that research outputs and data be made available openly as part of the research publication. Sometimes this practice is 'encouraged' rather than required but, in some cases, it is mandated as a condition of publication. In other cases, the best publication venue for research may be Open Access-only, in which case APC cost may be a factor that should be considered from the outset.Alongside any considerations about intellectual property, openness should be considered when contracts or MOU s are developed at the beginning of a research project. For example, for researchers doing work with a high level of public utility or interest it may be important to ensure that contractual terms will allow dissemination of research outputs in the ways researchers need or want, especially where that research is funded from outside the university or is a collaboration with other groups or organisations.Open Access and ethicsIn terms of research ethics, where there is a possibility that research outputs may be made available openly (including anonymised data) best practice dictates that it is incumbent upon the researcher to make human participants aware of this possibility. Any significant change that is made in a research project that falls outside the parameters set in the ethics approval process may require new approval being sought from participants. High standards of ethical behaviour in the treatment of research data and other materials is not affected in any way by these guidelines and such considerations may preclude the availability of making research outputs open.Notwithstanding the above, release of data and other outputs is entirely possible where researchers follow best practices for cleansing and anonymisation of data and other information gathered as part of research.Publication of research outputsRetain rights in formal publications Staff and students are encouraged to retain rights that allow deposit or other open use of their work; transfer to a publisher should only be done where necessary. Specifically, authors should favour publishing agreements where they retain copyright in their work and simply provide a licence to publish to the publisher. Where a copyright transfer is the option provided by a publisher the following considerations should be made, bearing in mind that contracts are negotiable: Do I have a licence to use my work as I wish? For example: Can I deposit it in a repository? Can I share it on my own or departmental website or via social media? Can I use it for teaching students? Can I develop it further and incorporate it into future publications or use it in my own future research?Is there an embargo period?Can I have rights revert to me after a period of time defined in the agreement?Will other people be able to access and/or use my work in ways that I would like, e.g. community groups, other researchers, students, government agencies?Use stable, non-commercial repositories for Green OA \u201cGreen OA \u201d is where a version of a work is made freely available via an institutional research repository or a similar repository, such as a discipline-specific archive or pre-print server. Very often the version of a work used in the Green method is a pre-publication version, such as either an initial draft (sometimes known as a \u201cpre-print\u201d) or version that incorporates changes based on feedback from peer-reviewers (a \u201cpost-print\u201d or \u201cAuthor's Accepted Manuscript\u201d). However, some publishers' policies allow the final version of record to be deposited, often after the observance of an embargo period.General points: Stable, non-commercial repositories should be favoured. OUR Archive should be the default for most Otago authors, since the University is committed to maintaining this resource; it is also indexed by Google Scholar and other indexing services. However, specific repositories may be more appropriate where this is the norm in a particular discipline.Staff and students are responsible for ensuring they comply with publishers', funders' or other requirements to ensure deposit in OUR Archive or other suitable repository of research outputs is legal. This may include stipulations about which version (if any) of a work may be archived or embargo periods that must be observed before a work is made openly accessible. The Sherpa/Romeo database provides information on publisher copyright policies and self-archiving. Sherpa/Juliet provides the same for research funders' policies.Commercial academic networking sites are widely-used and offer a popular means of providing access to research outputs for people who do not have access through institutional subscriptions. It is recommended that these be used in addition to, rather than instead of, stable non-commercial repositories since commercial sites have proven to be unstable in the long-term and may be bought out by competing interests.Gold Open AccessEvaluation of Gold OA publishers As with any kind of publication, authors must evaluate the quality of a potential venue for publishing their work. This can have important consequences for career, reputation and promotion. Most scholars will be familiar with attempts by \u201cpredatory publishers\u201d to attract researchers into paying for publication, often in publications without any peer review or editorial services. Such services are better thought of simply as low quality publications, just as there are low quality non-open access publications. Regardless of the business model of a publisher, due diligence should be exercised in evaluating a possible venue for publication. Consult the checklist available at thinkchecksubmit.org for evaluating the practices and policies of a journal.Free Gold OA versus APC -funded OA There are many considerations for a researcher when deciding where to submit work for publication. All things being equal, an open access pathway should be preferred to a closed one. As outlined in the Open Access Policy, free Gold OA should be favoured where this is an option and once other factors are considered.General points: Gold OA does not always involve payment of a fee or APC . Check the journal's policy on waivers. Many journals and publishers offer waiver of APC s, for example where authors have contributed to peer-review or editorial work.Paying for Gold OA is a decision for the relevant cost centre, where factors other than access to the work determine that paid Open Access is the best choice, such as publication in an APC -only journal with a high reputation.Hybrid OA \u2013 where a publication is not open access but offers the option to make individual pieces of work freely accessible for a fee \u2013 is, generally speaking, not supported by the institution as it is likely that the University already pays a subscription fee for access to the journal. Nevertheless there may be occasions where other factors determine that Hybrid OA is appropriate, such as a high-impact piece of work that may garner significant media and public interest.Resources: The University of Otago Library provides useful information about Research Publishing and Impact.The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group provides a factsheet on APCs:AOASG Factsheet no. 1: Article Processing Charges (PDF)The Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) provides a whitelist of open access publishers that meet a set of criteria in terms of policies and publishing practices.Other materialsFor teaching materials, staff should always consider how their work might be licensed. By default, all-rights-reserved will apply to their work but many staff do no label their teaching materials in any way at all. Doing so \u2013 whether this is with an all-rights-reserved notice or an open access licence or something else \u2013 helps their students to understand what they may or may not do with material and encourages them to treat others' intellectual property with due respect.LicensingThe Creative Commons Attribution licence is the licence that facilitates the widest possible reuse, provided proper attribution is given. The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group provides a factsheet on Open Licences.AOASG Factsheet no. 2: Open Licences (PDF)Staff and students must ensure that applying an open access licence is appropriate, i.e. they cannot apply an open licence to third party copyright materials that are not open to use. Such work may be included but must be specifically marked as the copyright of others. Similarly staff and students are responsible for ensuring that they follow licences imposed by others, e.g. proper attribution or share-alike reuse, if reusing material made available by others under an open licence.It is also important to comply with funder and government agency requirements to make results of work publicly available where appropriate.FormatsStaff and students who wish to release work openly in digital format should consider use of non-proprietary formats so as to facilitate reuse by people but also machine-readability for search engines and other automated processes.Common formats include Comma-separated Value (.csv) for spreadsheet or tabular information or Extensible Markup Language (.xml) for written documents. Where proprietary formats are commonly-used, such as Portable Document Format (.pdf), making additional copies available in alternative formats may help to ensure maximum accessibility and potential for reuse.NZGOAL provides advice on choice of file formats for many different types of data and information.NZGOAL Guidance note 2: File formatsResourcesThe University of Otago Library provides useful information about Research Publishing and Impact.NZGOAL \u2013 the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (Version 2).thinkchecksubmit.org provides a useful checklist of things to evaluate the practices and policies of a journal.The Sherpa/Romeo database provides information on publisher copyright policies and self-archiving.

        "name": "Guidelines_for_Email_Communications",
        "scope": "These guidelines apply to all staff employed by the University, and all Approved Persons who are approved to send or receive email communications on behalf of the University.\nThese guidelines do not apply to students, other than those students who are also staff employed by the University.",
        "content": "Sending and respondingThe University acknowledges that the use of email can increase pressure on workplaces through the large number of emails sent to some staff and the desire for an immediate reply. Staff are not expected to respond to emails outside of their normal work hours, except in exceptional circumstances.Consider the most appropriate channel(s) for your communication depending on your audience, content/message, time frame, etc. Email may not be the appropriate form of communication for some matters \u2013 especially for urgent requests for information or assistance to University service/support areas such as AskOtago. Please consider contacting these areas by phone or Teams for issues requiring an urgent response.The use of shared mailboxes is encouraged for certain staff roles (e.g., Heads of Department, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Directors etc.) and areas that provide services in response to email. The shared mailbox helps support functional continuity for managing requests/communication sent via email. Where appropriate, staff using a shared mailbox should identify who is sending the email (e.g., Pro-Vice-Chancellor or EA). Further information about shared mailboxes can be found in the AskOtago knowledgebase.It is recommended that you do not: open unexpected attachments from unknown or even known senders.follow web links within an email message unless you are certain that the link is legitimate. Following a link in an email message executes code, which can also install malicious programs on your computer.complete forms sent via a web link from an unknown sender. This is to mitigate the risk of identity theft.Contact AskOtago immediately if you suspect you have been the victim of an email scam/phishing attack.Consider the appropriate person(s) to whom a message is to be sent. Sending emails to a number of people can lead to uncertainty as to the responsibility for action, double handling, wasted time, lost information, delayed responses and general frustration.When sending emails, it is recommended that the 'To' field is used for those people who are required to take some action in the matter and that the 'Cc' field is used for those people to whom the email is sent only for information purposes. Alternatively, it may be helpful to include an appropriate note in either the subject or at the beginning of the message where an email is being sent for information purposes only. This can be done either by stating that the message is \"For your information\" or \"No action is required on your part\".Ensure that your message is going to the intended recipient(s) by checking the email address is correct (especially if just the recipient Display Name is showing). This is particularly important when using an address book that includes staff and student names, and where individuals have more than one email address listed. There are also instances of more than one individual having the same name, so it is important to check you have selected the correct person.Message contentMembers of the University community are strongly encouraged to use personal and professional courtesies and considerations in email messages.The University strongly encourages the use of te reo M\u0101ori in at least the greeting and closing parts of the email message. More Information can be found on the University website, and in Ng\u0101 Kaupapa m\u014d te reo M\u0101ori \u2013 the M\u0101ori Language Policy.Before forwarding/including others in an existing communication, ensure that the content of the full message trail is appropriate to be sent to the recipient(s).Ensure that special precautions are taken when handling sensitive information (e.g., health or HR information), including: attaching appropriate information security measures to the email communications in accordance with the University\u2019s Information Framework and Information Security Policy;anonymising Personal Information if possible;encryption of Personal Information when appropriate;password protection on files that are attached to emails when appropriate.When sending or forwarding to external organisations emails containing information or attachments classified as confidential or restricted, the email should be signed and encrypted using an approved encryption method. These can include Microsoft Office password protect, and the encryption feature in WinZip. Passwords should be provided to the recipient using another form of communication, such as phone or text message.It is helpful to use a disclaimer to make clear the purpose/intention of a message, where relevant. For example, disclaimers can be used to highlight the presence of confidential and privileged information or to make it clear that the sender is not representing the University. See the following examples: \u201cThis message contains information that may be confidential and privileged. Unless you are the addressee (or authorised to receive the message for the addressee), you may not use, copy or disclose to anyone the message or any information contained in the message. If you have received the message in error, please advise the sender by return email and delete the message.\u201d\u201cThis email contains the thoughts and opinions of [your name] and does not represent the official University policy.\u201dSettingsAn email signature should be used to identify yourself clearly when communicating as part of your role with the University. Just as University business cards follow a consistent format, so too should email signatures, to present a visually coherent and on-brand message to those we communicate with. It is recommended that the University Email Signature Generator be used to create your email signature.For information security reasons, University staff email accounts must not be set up to forward messages to student email accounts or non-University email accounts.Staff are encouraged to create a \u201cPersonal\u201d folder within their email account to store messages of a personal nature.It is recommended that Staff away from work for longer than one working day should create an Automatic Reply/Out of Office message to let the sender know if they need to take any additional action (especially if the staff member will not be checking mail regularly). For example, it may be helpful to include the contact information for another staff member who can respond while the person is away.In situations where people have similar/identical known and last names, the Display Name field can be updated to include information to help distinguish between people (e.g., by adding your department/team or position title to your name information). Contact AskOtago to have this done.LeavingUpon leaving, a staff member (in consultation with their manager, as appropriate): should set up a personalised Automatic Reply/Out of Office message to let senders know that the account is no longer in use and whether their message has been forwarded. It can also let the sender know where to send both University and personal messages. If a personalised Automatic reply is not set up, the default one will be applied automatically when the email account is disabled (35 days after the staff member\u2019s end date in the HR System).can request that an internal forward to redirect incoming messages be set up (e.g., to a manager or colleague). Contact AskOtago to have this done.must not set their emails to automatically forward to a student email account or any non-University email account.should unsubscribe from email lists and distribution groups where appropriate.Email lists / distribution groupsThe University has a variety of established staff and student email lists. For some, membership is automatic depending on criteria such as your department/team, campus and/or that you are a staff member or a student. For these lists, it is likely that only approved senders will be able to send messages to members of the list. For others, membership will be voluntary (e.g., an area of interest, department social list, etc.) or indirect (e.g., the all-depts list).In all cases, care should be taken to ensure messages sent to a list are of relevance to list members and to check that a reply to a list message will go to where you intend it to (especially if the list is set up to automatically send replies to the list rather than the original sender).In some cases, it may be important to keep the email addresses that are included in an email list private. When this is the case, the sender should use the \u201cBcc\u201d field, ensuring that the sender is the only person who can see who is a member of the list.",

University Responsibilities\na.\tHuman Resources Responsibilities\n\nEnsure that staff with management responsibilities are aware of the requirements.\nProvide advice to Departments so that they can identify valid fixed term employment situations and provide an appropriate reason.\nEnsure that the reason in the employment agreement meets the standard required to be valid.\n\nb.\tDepartment Responsibilities\n\nEnsure that it is a valid fixed term employment situation i.e. that it is reasonable to conclude that the employment will end on the date specified (or at the end of the event specified) for the reason specified, and that the reason is valid.\nSeek advice where there is any doubt as to the validity of the fixed term employment situation.\nSeek advice if the nature of the employment changes.\nAdminister the employment effectively in line with University policies; ensuring that an annual leave plan is agreed and that the staff member has opportunity to participate in University processes including training and development, performance reviews and salary reviews, as appropriate.\nEnsure that communication to the staff member is consistent with the fixed term nature of their employment, i.e. ensure that the staff member is not given any expectation of ongoing employment, verbally or otherwise.\nAdminister the end of the employment effectively, providing information, including outstanding annual leave, to the Human Resources prior to the payroll cut-off for the staff member's final pay.\nWhere appropriate, support the staff member to seek new employment or career opportunities and provide opportunity for the staff member and the Department to provide feedback to each other about the employment.\n\nc.\tDivisional Heads (Deans in Health Sciences)\n\nEnsure that Heads of Department are aware of their responsibilities.\nEnsure that recommendations for fixed term employment are valid and the information provided to Human Resources meets these guidelines.\nSeek advice, or ensure that the Head of Department seeks advice, where there is any doubt as to the validity of the fixed term employment situation.\n\n\n2. Examples of Genuine Reasons for the University of Otago\nSometimes positions are clearly only available for a fixed period of time, and therefore the employer needs to clearly explain this to potential employees. It is a legal requirement that the employee understands the reason for the fixed term nature of the work he/she is agreeing to and how the employment agreement will end.\nIn the University of Otago context, genuine reasons based on reasonable grounds can be broadly defined as:\n\nAdditional staffing for peak workload periods (including seasonal work)\nProjects of a specific and limited duration (including research projects)\nCovering for staff members on leave\nCovering for staff members undertaking alternative duties\nCovering vacant positions until the recruitment process is complete\nUniversity student development opportunity positions\n\nReasons must be clear, detailed and specific to the employment situation for each fixed term appointment. Please seek advice from your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor on the reasons for fixed term employment, or on whether a position should be fixed term. Listed below are some examples of how genuine fixed term reasons can be applied in different limited duration work situations. The hiring manager can draft a fixed term reason specific to the employment situation using these examples as a guide, or contact Human Resources for assistance. The draft reason is reviewed by Human Resources then used in the letter of offer. The Head of Department/ Manager is responsible for ensuring that the reason provided fits exactly with the situation in each case.\n\na.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Additional staffing for peak workload periods (including seasonal work)\n\nto assist with a (define additional/peak workload e.g. backlog of filing/ university enrolments). Once the majority of the (e.g. enrolments) has been completed, which will be no later than the end date, the University will no longer require additional assistance.\nto teach the (topic name) component of the (course name). The lectures and tutorials will take place in (specific timeframe e.g. the 3rd and 5th weeks of Semester 1). Once the lectures and tutorials have been completed, the University will no longer require additional assistance.\nto provide additional teaching assistance on (course name). This assistance is necessary to meet the needs of an unexpectedly high number of students enrolled in this paper this (Semester/Year).\nto teach, examine and mark the (course name) for the University's Summer School.\nPlease note: Where a peak need situation becomes an ongoing need, it no longer fits the criteria for fixed term employment.\n\n\nb.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Projects of a specific and limited duration (including research projects)\n\nto undertake (define tasks/processes) within the (name of funded research project) project which are required to be completed by the end date in line with the project schedule and funding agreed with (name of funding source).\nto complete the (project name e.g. department website review) project and implement the recommended improvements. The project is to be completed by the end date.\nto undertake (define tasks/processes) of the (project name) project which are scheduled to be completed by the end date in line with the project schedule.\n\nPlease note: \n\n\n\nIt may be useful to attach a copy of the project plan or other relevant documents.\nIf there the work may be completed earlier than the end date provided, you may wish to include an early termination clause such as: \u201cShould the project be ahead of schedule, or the project requirements change, for any reason, the employee may be given one month's notice of termination.\u201d \nIf the employee is likely to undertake work outside the core aspects of the role, you may wish to include a statement such as: \u201cIn order promote collaborative research in this field and to support your academic development, you may be required to support teaching delivery, supervision of postgraduate students, preparation of future grant applications or to contribute to related projects. This does not affect the reason for the position, or the fixed term nature of the employment. \u201d\n\n\nc.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Covering for staff members on leave or reduced hours\n\nto provide cover for the position while the incumbent is on (parental) leave. The incumbent is expected to return from leave by the end date of this agreement. The position will end when the incumbent either returns from (parental) leave or resigns. If that return or resignation date is prior to the end date of this agreement, the employee will be given (one month)'s notice of termination.\nto provide additional staffing made necessary while a staff member is working reduced hours for an agreed period of time. Once the staff member resumes normal hours, which will be by the end date of this agreement, there will be no further need for this support.\nPlease note: Please provide the name of the staff member, the date that has been agreed for the staff member to return to work (or to normal hours), and any other information relevant to the proposed end date of the fixed term appointment. \n\n\nd.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Covering for staff members undertaking alternative duties\n\nto provide coverage for an academic staff member who would usually lecture in this area and who has been released from teaching and administration duties in order to allocate time during the academic year to focus on (specify as appropriate). The dates for this fixed term agreement are set to allow for sufficient time to prepare for the academic year and to complete end-of-year academic requirements such as marking. Once the academic staff member resumes normal duties, there will be no further need for this support.\nto provide additional staffing made necessary due to a staff member being released from normal duties to undertake additional work required to (specify e.g. complete project). Once this additional work is finished, which will be by the end date of this agreement there is no further need for this support.\nPlease note: Please provide the name of the staff member who has been released from duties; and confirmation that either:\n\n\nthe agreement to release the staff member ends on a date that is consistent with the end date of the fixed term agreement; or\nthe additional work that the staff member is doing ends on a date that is consistent with the end date of the fixed term agreement\n\n\ne. Fixed Term Reason Examples: Covering a vacant position until the recruitment process is complete\n\nto provide cover for the position while the position is advertised and filled. When the successful candidate is appointed, and a handover period has been completed, the position will end. This process is expected to be completed by the end date of this agreement.\nPlease Note: You may wish to include an early termination clause such as: \u201cShould an earlier appointment be made, the employee will be given (one month)'s notice of termination.\u201d\n\n\nto cover a vacant position while the Department undertakes a review of its requirements. The review will be completed by the end date of this agreement, at which time the Department's requirements will be known and, if a position is required, it will be advertised accordingly.\nPlease note: For this type of situation, the Head of Department/Manager must be able to clearly show evidence that the review is planned and has a timeframe that is consistent with the end date of the fixed term agreement. \n\n\nf.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: University Student Development Opportunity Positions\nThe University of Otago has positions which are specifically created to enable University of Otago students to gain practical work experience during, or immediately following, their degree. These include Tutors & Demonstrators, Assistant Lecturers, Residential Assistants, Dental House Surgeons and may include other specific positions as agreed by the Head of Department and Divisional HR Manager.\ni. Tutors & Demonstrators\nto provide an opportunity for students attending the University of Otago to develop their academic knowledge and experience. The function of this position is to provide support for students as a tutor or demonstrator and undertake specific duties associated with the provision of (specify papers) during the academic year. Once the semester is finished there is no further need for this support. The parties agree that it is important that as wide a range of students as possible have this experience, and accordingly the employee's employment will end at the conclusion of the semester without further notice, and the position may be offered to a different student for the following semester. For the same reasons, this Agreement will end earlier, with notice, if the Employee ceases to be a student.\nii.\tResidential Assistants\nto provide an opportunity for students attending the University of Otago to make an important contribution to their College by working with their peers, whilst obtaining some financial assistance with the cost of study. It is an opportunity that with support and training assists students to develop their leadership and organisation skills, further extending the range of educational experience. In so doing students contribute to the special student culture that is distinctive to Otago's tertiary Institutions. The parties agree that it is important that as wide a range of students as possible have this experience, and accordingly the employee's employment will end at the conclusion of the academic year without further notice, and the position may be offered to a different student for the following academic year. For the same reason, the parties agree that this agreement will end earlier, with notice, if the employee ceases to be a student.\niii.\tAssistant Lectureship\nto provide an opportunity for PhD students attending the University of Otago to develop their academic knowledge and experience. The employee will be required to undertake supervised teaching and research duties in addition to their PhD studies. The parties agree that it is important that the Department is able to continue to offer this opportunity to successive post graduate students so that they can have also have the opportunity to gain this experience. Accordingly the employee's employment is fixed term and will end on [e.g. the planned PhD completion date (which is the end date of this agreement)]. For the same reason, the parties agree that this agreement will end earlier, with notice, if the employee ceases to be a student.\niv.\tDental House Surgeons\nto provide the opportunity for recent Otago Dentistry graduates to undertake a dental internship to gain further experience in teaching and clinical experience and to further prepare them for their career, although it does not guarantee that the recipient will be appointed to an academic or clinical position in the future. The parties agree that it is important that this development opportunity is made available to a wide a range of appropriately qualified graduates each year, and accordingly the employee's employment will end at the conclusion of the specified period without further notice, and the position will be offered to a different student in the next intake.\n\ng.\tNote for the preparation of offer letters\n\nThe draft fixed term reason that you provide will be reviewed by Human Resources, and edited in consultation with you as appropriate. Once finalised, the reason will be used within the letter of offer, normally within the following paragraph:\n\u201cThis employment agreement is for a fixed-term commencing {start date} and ending on {end date} without further notice. The reason for the fixed-term is {fixed-term reason}. We do not expect your employment to continue beyond the end of the fixed term because of this reason. Nothing contained or implied in this agreement is intended to create an expectation of an employment relationship continuing beyond the end of the specified term. No express or implied promise of continuing or subsequent employment will be binding on the University unless it is made expressly and in writing.\u201d\nIf the guidelines request that additional information is provided to justify the fixed term reason (for example, the name of the staff member on leave whose position is being covered by the fixed term appointment), please note this information on the recommendation to appoint form (Academic / General). In some cases it may be useful to attach relevant documents (for example, a project plan).\n\n\n3.\tConsiderations in Defining the Fixed Term Reason\na.\tIn defining the fixed term reason, the Head of Department needs to consider:\n\nThe likelihood of the employment ending before the end date specified and an appropriate notice period if this were to occur. Some of the example reasons provided include the arrangements for giving notice to end the employment should it be necessary before the date specified.\nWhether there is more than one reason e.g. \u201cwhere the person will cover 0.3FTE of the Department Administrator's position while she is on reduced hours until 3 December and will provide administrative support to the Project Manager until the project is completed on 5 January\u201d. Where there is more than one reason for ending the position, this must be clearly stated in the agreement.\nWhether the hours of work will vary over the term of the agreement. Where this is likely, the reason should include arrangements for varying hours of work.\nWhether the type of work will vary over the term of the agreement, or where there is an expectation that the employee will undertake work outside the core position. This should be clearly stated to avoid any confusion, and to ensure that the fixed term reason is valid.\nWhether there is a history of fixed term reasons for the position or employee that may create doubt about whether it is reasonable to conclude that the employment will end. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\n\nIt is important to remember that a fixed term employee has no right or claim over any future work, project, fixed term employment or permanent employment. Where the Head of Department's assessment is that a successful candidate for a fixed term position should be employed for any similar work in future, and that similar work is likely to be available in the future, a permanent appointment should be considered. (If the position is research funded, please refer to the Research Funded Permanent Staff Guidelines.)\nPlease seek advice from your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor on the reasons for fixed term employment and on whether a position should be fixed term. This will help minimise any delays in the recruitment process. \nb.\tPotential Employees Who Are Only Available for a Fixed-Term\nThere may be situations where potential employees only want to commit to a position for a set period of time. Please note that this does not change the permanent (or longer term fixed term) nature of the position, nor does it alter the requirement to advertise that position. An offer can include a statement such as:\n\u201cAlthough the position is available on a (a permanent basis/ until date), your employment agreement has an agreed end date of (end date) due to your request and availability. The end date may be reviewed at any time up to (specify e.g. two months) before the end date, on your request.\u201d\n\n4.\tConsiderations in Making a Fixed Term Appointment\na.\tRemuneration and Budget Considerations\nThe University's remuneration policy applies to fixed term staff members. A staff member's remuneration is likely to increase during their employment due to either negotiated increases or salary reviews. The Head of Department is responsible for ensuring that potential salary increases are considered before approving the appointment. The Department is responsible for covering any additional costs. Please seek advice from the Manager, Promotions and Remuneration if you have any queries.\nb.\tAdvertising\nA genuine reason based on reasonable grounds for the fixed term must be provided before a position can be advertised.\nPositions of more than 12 months must be advertised. In exceptional circumstances you can request this be waived. Prepare a memo summarising the case and attach it to the recommendation to appoint form for the approval of the Director of Human Resources. An exceptional circumstance might be where the potential employee is a named Principal Investigator on a successful research grant application.\nFixed term positions of less than 12 months can be advertised as appropriate. A contestable selection process should normally take place, however it is appreciated that, from time to time, there is an immediate need to provide a staffing resource.\nImportant Note: Close relatives and close friends of staff members in the Department or Section concerned cannot be considered for appointments that have not been advertised. If a close relative or friend of a staff member is being considered, the staff member currently in the employ of the University should not justify the need for the appointment, select the appointee, or directly supervise them. Please refer to the University's Ethical Behaviour Policy or contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for assistance.\nc.\tAcceptance\nA signed acceptance will be required from the employee, which will include a declaration that they understand the reason for the fixed term agreement and how their agreement will end, prior to commencing work. Employees must not start work before signing their fixed term agreement.\nApproving named individuals on grant applications\nWhere an individual who is not a current permanent employee of the University is named on an application for a research grant, and the grant is successful, the individual is likely to have an expectation of employment with the University at the remuneration level specified in the grant. Therefore, when approving grant applications, the Head of Department, Dean and Divisional Head must:\n\nEnsure that it would not be practicable to advertise to enable suitably qualified persons to apply for the position.\nEnsure that the individual is suitable for employment at the University of Otago. This includes appropriate employment reference checking.\nEnsure that the proposed level of appointment and remuneration are consistent with University policies and maintain relativities in the Department, School and Division.\n\n\n5.\tWhat Happens if Changes to a Fixed Term Appointment are Necessary?\nIn any employment agreement, the University of Otago normally commits to set hours of work, remuneration and the end date. However, change is sometimes necessary. If you need to change the employment agreement, the change could be negotiated and agreed with the staff member or, in some cases, the management of change process may be required. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\na.\tExtension\nIf the progress of the work is not as expected, it may become necessary to extend the period of employment to enable the work of the original fixed term position to be completed. The nature of the employment and the reason for the employment ending must be the same as the original fixed term agreement, and the reason for the extension justified. Short extensions may be used up to a maximum of 3 months beyond the original fixed term end date. Extensions can be requested by memo. Human Resources will send formal advice of variation to the staff member.\nAn extension cannot be used if new or different work is available for a fixed term, and a current fixed term employee would be able to do this work. Nor can an extension be used if similar work is available for a new period of time and then ending for a different reason. Continued employment cannot be achieved by extending or changing the current fixed term employment in these situations. A new fixed term position would be created and the Head of Department would need to consider an appropriate advertising and selection process before appointing to that position. This new appointment would be requested using normal process.\nThe Head of Department must ensure that any extensions or new offers are agreed in writing before the end of the current fixed term employment. No employee should continue to work beyond the end date of their fixed term agreement.\nb.\tHours of Work\nIf the progress of the work is such that it is necessary to increase, decrease or change the hours of work, and an agreement with the staff member is reached, the University's change of hours form should be completed, approved by both parties and sent to Human Resources for processing. Otherwise, please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\nc.\tNature of Work\nIf the requirements change during the fixed term agreement, there must be documented variation to the employment agreement, or a new fixed term agreement. This could occur if a project does not go as planned, if the work is completed earlier than planned, or if there is an urgent need for their skills in another area. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\nd.\tEarly End of Employment\nA need to end the employment early could occur if a project does not go as planned, if a key staff member leaves and the University is unable to continue the work, or if the work is completed earlier than planned. The ability to end a fixed term agreement early depends on the wording of the agreement. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\n\nAppendix 1: Fixed Term Employment and New Zealand Employment Legislation\nThe Employment Relations Act 2000 (section 66), requires that a fixed term Employment Agreement must be for \u201cgenuine reasons based on reasonable grounds\u201d, that the employee must agree to those reasons and that those reasons and the way the Employment Agreement will end be recorded in writing as part of every fixed term Employment Agreement.

In the event of adverse weather conditions (such as snow, ice or floods) it is expected that the University will remain open and staff are expected to undertake all reasonable and safe steps to attend and work. It is expected that any staff member who is prevented by adverse weather conditions from getting to work or who will be significantly delayed, will, in all cases, phone their Supervisor/HOD/Dean at the earliest opportunity to explain their absence.\nStaff who are unable to attend work because public transport is not operating, and they are not able to walk (because the distance is unreasonable) or drive (because the roads are impassable), will not have a deduction taken from their annual leave.Staff are expected to come to work as soon as conditions permit (for example, once buses are operating after snow), otherwise the day should be treated as an annual leave day or as leave without pay.Staff who do not attend work, in a situation where the Supervisor assesses that they could reasonably have done so, albeit later than normal, will take the day as annual leave or leave without pay.Staff who are at work and feel that they live in a location where it may be difficult to get home if the weather deteriorates, may leave work with the agreement of their Supervisor/HOD/Dean without any deduction of annual leave.Staff who have dependants who must be cared for, and where that situation has arisen because of adverse weather conditions, may take domestic leave, this being a debit against their sick leave.If a dependant child's school opens late, the staff member will be expected to arrive at work as soon as practicable after school starts and no leave deduction will be made.Where possible, staff should anticipate an adverse event and make alternative travel or work arrangements.\n2. Among the key factors for Supervisors/HODs/Deans to consider in determining whether staff absences are appropriate are:\nIs it safe to get to work?Are the Northern and/or Southern motorways closed (in Dunedin)?Are the buses running?Are early childcare institutions and schools closed/closing?The degree of effort exercised by staff and whether they have made attempts to make alternative travel or work arrangements.",

        "name": "Laboratory_Animal_Allergy_Prevention_Guidelines",
        "scope": "All University of Otago animal facilities",
        "content": "1. What is Laboratory Animal Allergy (LAA)?\nLaboratory animal allergy (LAA) is an inappropriate immune response to otherwise harmless proteins (allergens) in the urine, saliva, fur, and skin cells of laboratory animals such as rats and mice. LAA affects 10-50 per cent of individuals who are exposed to these allergens. Symptoms include sneezing, running nose, eye inflammation, skin rash and, most seriously, asthma. In addition to a reduced quality of life for affected individuals, both employees and employers suffer due to absence from work and potentially, job loss. The allergenic proteins implicated in LAA are carried on microscopic dust particles that can remain airborne for considerable periods of time, and, unless contained, can migrate throughout a laboratory or animal facility. They can also be carried around a facility on clothing and hair. Although individuals who work directly with laboratory animals are most at risk of developing LAA, the migratory ability of the allergens means that LAA can also affect susceptible individuals who have no direct contact with animals. Some individuals have a greater chance of developing LAA than others, since risk factors include the amount of daily allergen exposure and the presence of pre-existing allergies. It is not currently known whether there is an acceptable upper limit for levels of laboratory animal allergens; the aim of LAA management must therefore be to reduce the levels to as low as possible.\n2. Guidelines for prevention of LAA\nThe Health and Safety in Employment Act (1992) and regulations, require the identification of significant hazards, and management of these hazards by the hierarchy of elimination, isolation or minimisation. LAA is considered a significant hazard, and therefore consideration of elimination of exposure to animal allergens is the first step. The University is managing the hazard controls through the required elimination, isolation and minimisation, as explained below.\n2.1 Engineering controls \u2013 working towards elimination\nThe primary engineering control to be applied is ventilation and extraction of the animal allergens to reduce the amount of airborne allergens, thereby reducing exposure. The air levels of allergens is also monitored, however, there is no international standard on the minimum safe exposure (workplace exposure standard) for animal allergens.\nRoom ventilation: the rate of room extraction, delivery of fresh air and downdraft created is designed to remove allergen loading in the air. The ventilation rates are based on international best practice guidelines at 10\u201315 fresh air changes per hour, with the animal rooms at negative pressure so that allergen laden air is not re-circulated to non-animal areas. The ventilation rates are monitored annually.\nIndividually ventilated cage systems: exhaust ventilated cages, or individually ventilated cages, remove the air from the cages (the direct source) and vent it straight outside, without re-entering the room. This greatly reduces the air borne allergens. The University of Otago will consider the installation of individually/exhaust ventilated cages as a part of the upgrade process of animal facility areas.\nCage change ventilation: The cage emptying, or dumping, generates large volumes of airborne allergens. To reduce the hazard, cage dumping stations are used with an extraction unit directly behind the waste receptacle. This unit drags the air from around the operator, across the dumping space, and then vents it to the outside away from the breathing zone. It is important that any cage changing is done with a cage dumping station and for the individual to wear a P2 mask.\nUnfortunately, engineering controls cannot completely eliminate the source of animal allergens \u2013 the animal dander and urine may contact the skin during handling, and manipulation of animals requires close contact. The methods of isolation and minimisation must also be applied through the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and administration (reducing time with the animals).\n2.2 Isolation and minimization: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nConventional facility with open shoe box cagingTaskHead coverScrubs/gown/lab coatGloves*P2 maskEntering facility only\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aHandling rodents\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aChanging cages\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aRemoving soiled bedding\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\nVentilated Cage Facility (EVC or IVC)TaskHead coverScrubs/gown/lab coatGlovesP2 maskEntering facility only\u00a0\u221a\u00a0\u00a0Handling rodents\u00a0\u221a\u221a\u221aChanging cages\u00a0\u221a\u221a\u221aRemoving soiled bedding\u00a0\u221a\u221a**\u221a\n*Must include a non-latex option **gloves more resistant to puncture (e.g. nitrile) may be required to reduce the risk of injury/exposure during the handling of soiled bedding.\nTo ensure the maximum protection for staff, PPE should be put on before entering the animal rooms and removed on exiting. All used PPE should be disposed of in appropriate receptacles prior to exiting the facility and should not be carried into non-animal areas such as laboratories, offices or public rooms. However, face masks can be reused; and stored in plastic bags between use.Risk of splash: where the work has a risk of splashing the face, as cage washing, a face shield or goggles must also be worn.\nMinimisation includes the wearing of appropriate PPE to prevent the allergens contacting the skin, or entering the breathing zone.\nConsistent use of PPE is essential in preventing/reducing exposure to allergens and these are readily available at the entrance of animal facilities. PPE that prevents skin contact and inhalation of animal allergens helps to reduce personal exposure and risk of sensitization as well as reduces the spread of allergens throughout the facility.\nThe required PPE for entry into animal facilities with conventional caging is:\nLong\u2013sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubsHair covers/bonnetsP2 respiratory masks\nWhere the animal facility has an individually ventilated caging system, the requirements are:\nLong-sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubs\nThe required PPE for entry into animal facilities with conventional caging is:\nLong\u2013sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubsHair covers/bonnetsP2 respiratory masks\nWhere the animal facility has an individually ventilated caging system, the requirements are:\nLong-sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubs\nThere are circumstances where additional PPE is required, regardless of the caging system:\n1. Direct skin contact\nWhere the work involved requires direct skin contact (such as handling/picking up the animals) with the animals, including surgery, the following items are required in addition to the above:\nGloves (including an option of non-latex alternatives)\n2. Soiled bedding\nEmployees working with animals and/or soiled bedding must wear gloves (e.g. nitrile) and disposable lab coats or other coverings (e.g. scrubs). Gloves less prone to puncture (e.g. nitrile) along with proper animal handling and restraining techniques help to reduce the risk of bites. Hand washing and showering after exposure to allergens helps to dramatically remove allergens.\nGloves (including an option of non-latex alternatives)\n3. Risk of splash\nWhere the work has a risk of splashing the arms or face, and high risk activities such as cage changing:\na face shield or goggles must also be worn.\nTo ensure the maximum protection for staff, PPE should be put on before entering the animal rooms and removed on exiting. All used PPE should be disposed of in appropriate receptacles prior to exiting the facility and should not be carried into non-animal areas such as laboratories, offices or public rooms.\n2.2 (i) Supply of PPE\nPPE is provided in the Biomedical Research Facility (BRF) for authorised users. Other facilities are required to provide suitable PPE at departmental cost.\n2.2 (ii) Care of PPE\nPPE must be located close to the entrance/exit of the facility. On entering the facility, you must remove your jacket, etc, and then wash your hands before putting on a gown and head covering. If you are required to handle animals during your visit (rather than just sight observation) you must wear gloves. The facility will have somewhere to store the clothing items \u2013 either by hooks or lockers. Shared gowns are acceptable, providing they are not visibly contaminated. Your mask is an individual item (see below).\n2.2 (iii) Gloves\nGloves should be readily available with an option of non-latex gloves. Gloves need to be put on before handling any animals and disposed of immediately after removal. Hand washing is required before putting gloves on and on removal, particularly as you exit the facility.\n2.2 (iv) Gowns\nLong sleeves are required to provide protection to the forearms from dander and urine, and should be cuffed. There are a couple of options here: either cloth gowns are provided by the facility, stay within the facility and are laundered on site to the recommended temperature or laundered by a professional service. No gowns or animal facility clothing is to be taken home. Disposable gowns may be used and are for single use only and disposed of at exiting the facility.\n2.2 (v) Hair covers\nHair covers are to prevent the retaining of animal allergen particles in the hair which are then transferred to non-animal areas. Individuals wearing burqa or veils for religious reasons must ensure complete coverage.\n2.2 (vi) Respiratory protection/P2 masks\nAll respirators/masks must meet the requirements of AS/NZS 1715 to ensure an adequate level of protection. Surgical or dust masks do not provide any protection against airborne animal allergens and must not be used. A Particulate 2 or n95 mask is required to prevent the inhalation of animal allergens. These masks are available in single use disposable \u201cduck bills\u201d similar to a surgical mask. These masks may be with or without a valve. The following masks are available from New Zealand Safety.\nAll P2 masks are required to be fit tested \u2013 once the mask is on, cup both hands over the respirator and inhale sharply. If air flows around the edges readjust the nose piece and straps and repeat the process. If the mask does not fit correctly, it will not protect you. If you have facial hair, these types of mask will not provide you with protection as you will not be able to achieve a proper fit. Please see the H&S team to advise you on a correct fit.\n\nAbove \u2013 single use disposable P2 mask\nThe following masks may be reused, however as soon as the mask becomes wet it must be disposed of. If you are reusing these masks, they must be stored in a sealed plastic bag between uses and remain in the animal facility. Valve masks tend to be more comfortable and cooler to wear.\n\nMask 2200 \u2013 disposable with no valve\n\nMask 2400 \u2013 this mask also has a charcoal filter to remove odours/fumes if you are using hazardous substances\n\nMask 8822 with valve\n\nMask 2700 - valve, cotton with no latex and neck string\n\nHalf face rubber mask (8002) also available in silicon. These masks are fitted with replacement particulate cartridge filters. These masks are much cheaper and it is one per person. \n2.2 (vii) Air-fed respirators\nAir-fed respirators or positive air pressure respirator (PAPR) may be required to reduce exposure if you suffer from allergies to a species you work with. These respirators supply clean filtered air through a mask to the wearer, eliminating animal allergens to the breathing zone. Such respirators must be trialed and purchased in consultation with the H&S office. These respirators require full fit testing and on-going monitoring.\n3. Health surveillance\nHealth surveillance or monitoring is a part of the minimisation process \u2013 as the allergen cannot be completely eliminated from the environment and some exposure is possible then the potential health effects from the exposure must be monitored.\n3.1 Identifying those requiring surveillance\nAll staff and students who will be handling animals or exposed to the animal housing environment are enrolled in the health surveillance programme. All animal related appointments, such as technician staff, are enrolled in the health surveillance programme.  Staff and students identified on Animal Ethics approvals through the Animal Ethics Committees who are required to complete module 1, are automatically notified to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). OHS will email the health questionnaire to the individual on receipt of the notification, and then follow up with the questionnaire programme. New staff employed in animal facilities or housing should have the hazard of LAA clearly defined in their job description. Once the appointment has been made, the details of the position and individual are to be forwarded to OHS for enrolment in the health surveillance programme.\n3.2 Pre-placement health assessments\nWhere the position/job description clearly identifies that the position requires monitoring based on the criteria above, then pre-placement assessments will be required. The position descriptions must be sufficiently detailed for people with a pre-existing allergy to make an informed decision on whether to apply.\nAs it is potentially damaging to the health of people with pre-existing conditions to be exposed to animal allergens, it is a condition of employment that a satisfactory health clearance is obtained by H&S before the individual starts work. This includes the transfer of staff between positions. Please contact the H&S office (extn: 5034) for further information.\n3.3 Register of potentially exposed staff and students\nIt is mandatory for those potentially exposed staff and students to have health surveillance in order to detect the early signs of LAA and take action to reduce the risk of a severe allergic reaction and of long-term respiratory impairment.\nThose identified as potentially exposed staff and students will be recorded in a confidential health information system through the H&S office that meets the requirements of the Health Information Privacy Code 1994, and the Privacy Act 1993. All files are held securely with access restricted to the medical staff within the H&S team. Staff and students may request access to their individual records at any time, and access by any other person outside the Medical H&S team will not be permitted without the written consent of the individual.\n3.4 Health surveillance programme\nThe health surveillance system will generate an email for the individuals to complete an on-line health questionnaire. If certain questions or a combination of questions generates a health trigger, the individual and the H&S Team will be notified. At this stage, further health monitoring may be required through a referral to a Respiratory Physician for appropriate testing.\nIf further monitoring identifies asthma type reactions, a report will be forwarded to the individual, and to the H&S team. If the H&S team is required to notify your employer, manager or PI of your fitness to work, this will be completed with your approval and to the consent guidelines. No personal medical information will be disclosed without signed consent from the individual concerned.\nIf the results demonstrate an allergy to laboratory animals, the OHS team may advise that you are removed from working with animals until test results are available, and full assessment has been made. With mild cases of sensitivity, it is possible to maintain individuals in their work with suitable personal protective equipment. Where this is not possible, suitable redeployment may be required.\n3.5 Diagnosed cases of LAA\nWhere LAA is diagnosed, the ACC processes of determining a work related illness will be initiated. The decision on the claim and entitlements will follow the ACC policies and procedures. Staying at work or returning to work will be managed by the ACC Case Management team.",

        "name": "Guidelines_for_a_PhD_with_Practice_Research",
        "scope": "These guidelines apply to PhD candidates intending to submit a PhD with Practice Research.",
        "content": "Admission Expression of intent PhD with Practice Research applicants should indicate their wish to use a Practice Research methodology in their initial research proposal prior to admission into the University of Otago PhD programme. A brief, provisional description of processes/outputs potentially to be submitted for examination (e.g., performance, exhibition, design, novel, film, carving etc) should be identified, and an indication should be given of resources anticipated to be required for the research. A conceptual framework for the praxis should also be outlined. If the project is to involve any collaboration with other artists, it is important to detail the role of the candidate and the roles and nature of any contribution being made by others.PhD research is concerned with the production of epistemic insights (\u201cnew knowledge\u201d). Creative practices may not in themselves constitute research, regardless of aesthetic excellence or critical reception. In a PhD with Practice, candidates are required to undertake an investigative inquiry that leads to substantial new insights, effectively shared. The submission of a practice for examination must be accompanied by the submission of \u201ccomplementary writings\u201d (exegesis) which located the practice in a conceptual framework and a lineage (practice review). Together, the practice and complementary writings (exegesis) constitute \u201cthe thesis\u201d, evidencing the research inquiry and its findings and, accordingly, the written component is shorter than that required of an ordinary thesis (typically, c. 30,000 \u2013 40,000 words).From the perspective of te reo M\u0101ori practitioners and researchers, intellectual rigour can be measured through the conveyance of knowledge in oral and written forms of te reo M\u0101ori. Various oral art forms, such as karanga, whaik\u014drero, waiata and haka, are means through which expertise in m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori can be delivered in te reo M\u0101ori and consequently assessed for its validity and strength of an argument. Such a M\u0101ori centred practice component might form a significant component of a PhD.Note: please consult the relevant academic unit for further guidance on using a M\u0101ori centred practice component for a PhD with Practice Research.Only in exceptional circumstances would candidates registered for a PhD by thesis be permitted to change their registration to PhD with Practice.Prior training and experience PhD with Practice Research applicants will be required to demonstrate expertise, advanced training and/or professional experience in the discipline(s) involved in their proposal. Advanced training may be understood as a postgraduate degree or diploma; professional experience may be understood as at least two years of employment and/or professional productivity in the relevant field(s); expertise in M\u0101ori oral art forms is demonstrated by the practice of such oral forms over an extended period of time, and by the acknowledgement of such expertise by others (in the M\u0101ori world it is for other people to speak of someone\u2019s knowledge and expertise).Supervisor selection In addition to the University of Otago requirement that a primary supervisor will hold a PhD or have equivalent academic status, for PhD with Practice Research at least one of the supervisors will have relevant experience or standing in the field of practice or practice research.Quality of PracticeSince the primary criterion, as for any PhD, is a significant contribution to new knowledge or epistemic innovation in the area of practice, the quality of the practice, and its documentation, must be sufficient to the purpose. Any claim to the originality of the practice per se must be demonstrable either, in itself, or through explication of process and location in a lineage in the complementary writings.Exegesis (typically 30,000 \u2013 40,000 words, maximum 50,000 words)The exegesis is required to do more than merely describe the practice (process/product). Though findings may be manifest in the practice itself, they may not be self-evident to the viewer or the examiner on first view. Hence, it is necessary to accompany submission of a practice with a document that serves additionally to make the insights explicit. This exegesis outlines the methodology (Practice Research; Practice as Research; Artistic Research; Practice-led Research) and documents the process of investigation with critical reflection on it. It presents the conceptual framework and context of the project, including articulating and evidencing a research inquiry.An exegesis may typically be comprised of: Introduction \u2013 outlining the project, its origins and questions, contribution to knowledge and significance to the field/s; details of any contributions to the creative work made by collaborators.Methodology \u2013 articulation of the research methodology and methods and materials being utilised.Context/Conceptual Framework \u2013 a section on the context of the practice, including such matters as physical, traditional Indigenous, historical, artistic contexts as well as conceptual frameworks for the project.Location in a Lineage \u2013 a review of similar practices facilitates the identification of what is new about the submitted practice.Documentation of Process and Analysis \u2013 a detailed discussion of the project, closely analysing and reflecting upon how the project was conducted and how the different elements were drawn together in the project and to what effect, attributing, where required, the contribution of any collaborators.Conclusion \u2013 elucidating the new insights, recounting the findings and future research directions.Bibliography or references.Confirmation of CandidatureConfirmation of nominated practice research At the progress meeting considering confirmation, candidates must confirm their wish to pursue PhD with Practice Research and seek confirmatory approval from the Academic Head (HoD), and the Graduate Research Committee. Confirmation will require demonstration of satisfactory progression in all aspects of the inquiry.Content of review In addition to the normal expectations during the provisional period for a PhD candidate, it is expected that a candidate intending to present a practice will have: clarified the intended examinable format of the practice (as discussed in the examination guidelines below) within their completed research proposal;completed a draft of the methodology section of the exegesis, outlining how the investigative inquiry will lead to substantial new insights from their process/practice in a PhD research context.Criteria for progression The decision of the Academic Head (HoD) and the Graduate Research Committee to approve a PhD candidate\u2019s suitability for a PhD by Practice submission at, or following, a progress meeting will be informed by: the candidate's demonstrated ability to engage in a PhD with Practice Research;the candidate\u2019s progress within their provisional year; andthe Academic Unit\u2019s capacity to provide resources for the research, supervision and examination processes required by the candidate\u2019s research proposal.Submission and ExaminationSubmission formats Candidates for PhD with Practice Research will normally present in one or more of the following three formats: as printed material integrated into the bound exegesis document;as a digital recording in a portable format bound into the front of the exegesis document;as a live performance or exhibition (to be documented and included in the exegesis document).Examination Under standard PhD regulations, the thesis (practice and exegesis) will be examined as an integrated body of work in respect of its substantial new insights. The examiners may require minor amendments to the thesis, or may require the thesis to be revised and resubmitted. In making their determination, the examiners of a PhD with Practice Research may require amendments to either the practice and/or exegesis submission.Where amendments or re-examination is required for a PhD which includes a live performed practice or exhibition, the Convener of Examiners must be consulted to determine the feasibility of restaging the live performance or exhibition for examiners. Where this is deemed not possible, examiners will be referred to audiovisual documentation of the resubmitted performance or exhibition. See also the Regulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).Examination of live performance/exhibition Where the practice involves live performance or an exhibition, examiners should normally experience the work \u201clive\u201d and also be given access to any video recording of the event/s. While the research process might incorporate (and make reference to) several performances or exhibitions, only one live performance/exhibition can require the attendance of the doctoral examiners. The costs associated with bringing examiners to such an event (if separate from the oral examination visit) will be borne by the Academic Unit in which the student is enrolled. The event should be considered as independent of, though possibly temporally adjacent to, the oral examination. It is expected that the normal protocols determining that examiners do not confer on the candidate\u2019s work would be observed at any such event. It is expected that the submission of examiners\u2019 reports, the oral examination and the recommendation of the Convener of Examiners will otherwise follow the normal schedules and protocols for PhD examinations (not be guided by the timing of examiners viewing of practice at live events).Attribution It is the candidate's responsibility to attribute correctly the contributions to creative work made by collaborators. This attribution should include commentary in the introduction of the thesis (and elsewhere as appropriate) regarding the nature of any collaboration and the respective roles of the candidate and any collaborators (in this work).Copyright It will also be candidate\u2019s responsible to obtain any necessary third-party copyright or performers\u2019 permissions for: any subsequent public dissemination of recordings;presentation on any publicly-accessible digital archive. This permission should be obtained through media release forms or other relevant contracts.Documentation All productions, indigenous practices or exhibitions being presented for examination must also be recorded (and documented). It will be the candidate\u2019s responsible to organise such recordings in liaison with the school, programme or department where appropriate.If a live production or exhibition is presented for examination as a digital recording, the candidate is expected to articulate their role in the digital recording and editing process within their written thesis. The digital recording should also be at least 4K definition or a similar high standard.The candidate will be expected to gain the permission of any co-producers of the digital recording of the work.",

        "name": "Guidelines_for_Graduate_Research_Supervisors",
        "scope": "These Guidelines have been developed specifically for supervisors \u2013 both internal and external \u2013 of doctoral and master's thesis candidates at the University of Otago, but could be applied to supervision of other research students.",
        "content": "1. Supervisor requirements\nTo supervise a graduate research candidate, an academic should be appropriately qualified. For doctoral candidates, supervisors should normally have a doctorate, and for master's thesis candidates, they should have a master's degree or higher qualification. Where this is not the case, the academic will need to demonstrate to the Graduate Research Committee (for supervision of doctoral candidates) or the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of their division (for supervision of master's research candidates), that they have recent research experience and a publication record of a suitable standard.New supervisors may be a primary supervisor for doctoral candidates, providing a colleague who has supervised a PhD to completion at Otago takes on 33 per cent of the supervision load. The more experienced colleague must provide mentoring support for the new supervisor.Regarding supervision of doctoral candidates, a primary supervisor who has supervised to completion before can be a sole supervisor provided they are supported by a Departmental Advisory Committee.\n2. Expectations\nSupervisor-candidate expectations should be discussed early in candidature and a formalised agreement is recommended (a student-supervisor agreement is mandatory for PhD candidates). Expectations/agreements should be reviewed from time to time to ensure currency and relevance.Academic, supervisory and other issues that may affect progress should be talked through candidly and constructively by supervisors and candidates; this particularly applies in the early phases of work.The supervisory relationship should be an open, honest and professional interaction between candidate and supervisors, based on mutual respect, trust and good-will.The supervisory arrangement should be viewed as an evolving partnership, in which an initial candidate/supervisor relationship develops towards increasing equality as the project reaches its culmination in the production of the thesis.Supervisors and candidates should adhere to the Ethical Behaviour Policy.Supervisors and candidates should adhere to the Intellectual Property Rights of Graduate Research Students Policy.Staff should be aware of the potential for conflict of interest in a supervisory relationship and should familiarise themselves with the relevant sections of the Ethical Behaviour Policy and Conflicts of Interest Policy.Supervisors and candidates should discuss the use of data and findings from thesis research to clarify who has access, and how data might be shared and stored.Prior to embarking on publishing of graduate research results, supervisors and candidates should discuss authorship credit and author order. For example, the Vancouver Protocol could be followed.Supervisors are encouraged to complete checklists regarding admission, candidature, and submission requirements: Sample checklist for supervisors of doctoral candidates (DOC)Sample checklist for supervisors of master's thesis candidates (DOCX)\n3. Collegiality\nThe supervisor should: assist in integrating the candidate into the academic and social life of the departmentprovide a collaborative research environment and encourage open communicationensure that meetings with co-supervisors and/or departmental advisory committees operate in a constructive manner, andbe sensitive to cultural, political, gender or religious issues relating to the research topic or the candidate.\n4. Academic advice\nThe supervisor should: hold regular formal supervision meetings - usually at least fortnightlybe available, within reason, at other times to provide assistance when particular difficulties ariseencourage the candidate to adopt an independent approach to learningensure that the candidate is involved in setting the timetable for the research and reviewing progress of the researchprovide full, prompt, honest and informative feedback in a timely manner (usually within three weeks) to the candidate on work in progressremain conversant with the issues and the literature relating to the candidate's researchprovide reliable and well-informed guidance in all matters of sound research practice, andaccept that, in some aspects of the topic at least, the candidate's level of knowledge might eventually exceed that of the supervisor.\n5. Practical support\nThe supervisor should: discuss and ensure the candidate is aware of aspects of their research that require approval, such as: EthicsM\u0101ori consultationOverseas researchbe prepared to give advice on sources of financial support, or direct the candidate to those who can provide such adviceensure that the candidate is properly forewarned if the supervisor is to be absent from the University for more than a brief period (for the purposes of research and study leave, for example), andarrange, through the Head of Department, for adequate alternative supervision during any period of absence, either by assigning another staff member to take over supervision or by setting up other means of communication (by email or Zoom, for example).\n6. Support for the candidate's professional development\nThe supervisor should: discuss further educational and/or employment pathways with the candidatediscuss professional development needs with the candidateencourage the candidate to become an active member of the professional community, national and internationalfor doctoral candidates, ensure that the candidate has opportunities to contribute to research seminars within the departmentfor doctoral candidates, encourage the candidate to attend relevant conferences within New Zealand and overseas and offer guidance in the preparation of conference presentationsidentify work by the candidate suitable for publication in refereed journals or other academic publications and assist in the preparation of articles for submissionmake clear from the outset how issues relating to joint publication of work arising from the candidate's thesis are to be handled, andnot expect the candidate to work in the capacity of \u201ctechnician\u201d or \u201csecretary\u201d to the supervisor.\n7. Supervisor professional development\nNew supervisors are required to attend professional development workshops on supervision during their confirmation period, and preferably prior to taking on any supervision.All supervisors are encouraged to participate in the professional development programme for supervisors.Experienced supervisors are expected to take an active mentoring role when co-supervising with inexperienced supervisors \u2013 particularly those who have not supervised a candidate to completion.",

        "content": "Space ManagementThe University of Otago Space Management Policy sets out the Management Principals for use of space.The University of Otago Property Services Division manages space planning and has developed guidance for flexible and quality space, working towards meeting current and future needs of the University. Space efficiency reduces building costs, in terms of both capital and operating expenditure. The University looks to make best use of its space to ensure it becomes a sustainable resource, meeting the needs of the operation and ensuring an enduring legacy for future generations.The University looks to improve utilisation year on year working towards a target optimal utilisation of space.The Asset Management Unit maintains a database of occupancy of all University building spaces, which is used as a basis for allocating space and for charging internal rent. It is important that the Asset Management Unit is advised of all changes in use and occupancy in order to maintain this important management tool.Given the varied building portfolio it may not always be possible to utilise space to its theoretical maximum. A sensible and pragmatic approach should be taken within the constraints of existing buildings.Departments and Individuals are occupants of a space for a time and purpose to best align with the strategic priorities of the University. Allocation of space does not imply a permanent allocation and is therefore subject to change as required over time to ensure optimal utilisation of space for the University as a whole.The efficient use of existing space, including shared use of specialist facilities will take precedence over the construction or provision of new space.New, refurbished and existing spaces will be designed, configured and allocated to provide for flexible use in order to assist in maximising space utilisation and minimising ongoing costs while supporting innovation and collaboration.Data relating to space condition, utilisation and occupancy will be used to inform and support decisions relating to new build, refurbishment or redesign needs and scope.Efforts will be made to collocate departments and facilities, and to share facilities across multiple or all departments, to ensure most efficient use of space and operational efficiency.Space Use: Office AccommodationOffice Accommodation Principles The University aspires to create modern, flexible, varied and appropriate working environments that allow staff to perform to their best. The University will utilise the guiding principles set out in the New Zealand Government Property Group guidelines for office design to assist and guide new or refurbished space development.View the New Zealand Government Property Group guidelines for office designOpen Plan Working Environments: Shared open plan collaborative work spaces for communal activity supported by collaboration space for use by individuals or for group communication and socialisation.Shared Collaborative and Quiet Spaces: Shared space which supports group collaboration and meetings and flexible quiet space which supports individuals undertaking concentrated work at times.Utilisation of Technology: Harnessing technology to allow staff to do their job.Mobility & Adaptability: The desk is no longer considered the only viable work setting. Dynamic working environments embrace a wide range of technologies, spaces and settings that encourage areas for high concentration work, discussions and collaboration.Consistent Design: Staff move while the furniture stays in place. A fixed, generic layout will be designed to maximise the efficiency of the floor plate. Teams should be formed and reformed around the requirements of projects and activities, not pods of desks.Choice of Workplace Settings: The design of the open-plan working environment should be dynamic enough to enable staff to choose from a range of work settings.Safe and Secure Environments: The University is committed to providing safe and secure work environments for all employees and visitors, including clients and contractors; considering the needs of people with disabilities in the design and fit-out of the working environment.Spaceless Growth: In any expansion The University will first maximise the current space before acquiring additional space.Further details around the specific use of the principles are covered in the University Design & Facility Standards.Details of space standards are set out in the University Design & Facilities Standards.The needs of staff undertaking teaching or research will be taken into consideration alongside these principles to ensure that space is appropriately located relative to teaching and laboratory facilities, however it need not be directly adjacent in all cases.For smaller scale adaptations where there are constraints on configuration, these principles will still apply as far as is practicable in the circumstances.Office Accommodation Allocation Staff will be allocated space in shared work areas or single occupancy offices depending on the availability of space, the requirements of their roles, levels of space utilisation and building configuration.Staff working across multiple University buildings or campuses will be allocated a workspace at their primary location, with access to hot-desk facilities at secondary locations.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple dedicated workspaces are not supported.Administrative functions should be centralised where possible to allow sharing of task and job roles.Space should be adequately supported by ancillary cellular space for meeting, hot desking, focussed work and breakout. Communal space increases informal and social interaction and is intended to help support knowledge sharing.New build or refurbishment project teams should identify exemplars of best practice relevant to the proposed work function to help demonstrate shared environments and their support spaces.Right-sizing the spatial requirements and increasing the quantity of shared accommodation can help realise the following benefits: Improved flexibility and sustainabilityImproved efficiencyReduced Capital and Opex costs to both University and individual Divisions & DepartmentsImproved staff and student satisfactionImproved collaboration and social interactionOffice space should not be designed at a density detrimental to the health and wellbeing of staff. Density of spaces should not be increased without consultation with Property Services.Meeting Space Meeting space can be both formal and informal space and will be made available to all building users.All staff will be granted access to appropriate meeting facilities, in their building where available and otherwise in close proximity.Meeting rooms should be available for use by all. Meeting rooms will all be bookable on a shared booking resource available to all staff.Staff Facilities Staff common rooms, tea rooms and kitchen spaces will function as staff break-out areas and informal meeting spaces and will not be allocated or dedicated to specific departments or divisions; staff rooms will be accessible for all building occupants and will be shared across departments.Staff facilities may not always be created to a size and scale where all department or building staff can congregate at one time. Where special events involving large numbers of people are required, departments should consider use of larger facilities which may be outside of their building or department; infrequent large gatherings do not necessitate provision of additional space.Staff facilities will take into account the number of prospective occupants to provide adequate, fit for purpose space.Occupants will be jointly responsible for management of the space.Reception Areas Reception areas will be customer-focused. They will normally include some form of staffed area and will have space adjacent for a range of support functions from copy and hand-in facilities to PC access. This will be dependant upon function and location.Reception desks should be easily maintainable, secure and readily accessible for staff and students. All receptions should incorporate a designated wheelchair access space in accordance with current building code.Space use: Student spaceAllocation of Space for Students The University endeavours to provide space appropriate to the needs of undergraduate and postgraduate students supporting a range of pedagogical learning and teaching methods, research, and social learning spaces.Student space should acknowledge the changing nature of technology within the student environment and should support learning and study in a wide variety of environments to encourage the activation of buildings and space. Adequate power and data provision should be provided to all of these spaces.Undergraduates Undergraduates will not be provided with dedicated space for individual students.Collaborative learning and interaction spaces should be provided within departments/buildings to allow undergraduates to stay within their department and benefit from increased interaction with peers and staff; refer Social and Informal Learning Spaces below.Undergraduates should have access to good quality study and learning space both in library buildings and in other spaces across campus. These spaces should be varied in nature and acknowledge the different learning environments required to suit differing student preferences.Postgraduates Where possible postgraduate space should be allocated close to academic space to allow supervision and interaction.Workspaces will be made available for postgraduate students in dedicated shared work areas depending on the postgraduate student's research activities and space availability, and subject to the Resources for Graduate Research Candidates \u2013 Guidelines.Workspaces will be managed in a collaborative and flexible way across departments, so that space can be reallocated to respond to changes in the relative number of postgraduates in different departments.Postgraduate space should be supported by access to sufficient meeting spaces to allow for confidential conversations and teleconferencing when required and have access to student amenities including space for eating and refreshments and social spaces which encourage interaction.Social and Informal Learning Space Students spend a large proportion of their time outside of the classroom. Students and academic departments value time spent with peers discussing academic work. Creating spaces for spontaneous discussion is particularly important and should be included within every remodelling and capital project.Spaces should be flexible and allow regular reorganisation of the layout both by students and staff. They can be located in rooms, or within circulation space (subject to compliance with fire regulations). There should be a variety of furniture types, to allow flexible working and suit personal preferences.Consultation with the ITS Division on the provision of equipment and facilities is essential, before planning these spaces. Traditional catering and Library spaces will also provide this type of learning space.Allocation of Space for Teaching Teaching spaces will be provided as required to suit teaching pedagogy. Consideration should be given to future pedagogy and flexibility of space to support varying teaching styles.Formal learning spaces are one of the most visible components of campus life. Formal learning spaces require line of sight, good acoustics, technology enabled and a focal point at the front of the room. When designing the teaching space it is important to understand what type of learning is required and support this with the appropriate layout and furniture.Current and targeted space usageSpace usage and utilisation is captured and managed by the Property Services Division under Asset Management. Information is used to inform decisions around space usage.TEFMA carry out an annual benchmarking survey of University space which provides data on a variety of efficiencies for comparison with other Universities. Whilst direct comparisons are difficult to draw based upon variability of levels of research and teaching, it provides high level comparison.Space is a valuable resource and comes at a high capital and operational cost. The University currently has too much space, inefficiently utilised, and looks to make better use of its space to ensure it becomes a sustainable resource, meeting the needs of the operation. The University has set aspirational targets as defined below (d-g) which will be assessed on an annual basis.UFA to EFTS Current TEFMA ratio of UFA to EFTS: Otago Actual 2016: 12.34m2University of Otago aspirational UFA to EFTS: 2024: 10.00m2UFA to GFA Current TEFMA ratio of UFA to GFA: Otago Actual 2018: 61.8%University of Otago aspirational UFA to GFA: 2024: 65.0%Staff office utilisation Current ratio of UFA (office) to FTE: Otago Actual 2018: 12.48m2University of Otago aspirational UFA (office) to FTE: 2024: 10.00m2Postgraduate space utilisation Current ratio of UFA (postgraduate office) to postgraduate EFTS: Otago Actual 2018: 7.27m2University of Otago aspirational (postgraduate office) to postgraduate EFTS: 2024: 5.00m2\nThe above figures are used for benchmarking only and does not mean that staff are allocated these figures per person within their localised working environment.

        "content": "SummaryHonorary Titles are awarded to persons who are undertaking activities which provide a significant ongoing contribution of benefit to the University, and to recognise the importance of the continuing relationship between the appointee and the University.Honorary Titles are normally associated with the appointment of specialised and leading academic and professional persons to a position within the University.Titles are awarded in four categories: University of Otago Honorary Fellows are persons of distinction in organisations with strong affiliations with the University of Otago.University of Otago Honorary Academic Titles (Lecturer, Research Fellow, Senior Lecturer, Senior Research Fellow, Associate Professor, Research Associate Professor, Professor or Research Professor) are awarded to persons who are currently in employment with another university or who have been previously employed by the University of Otago in academic positions. The level of appointment will be dependent on the person having such academic and professional eminence that were they a member of the permanent university academic staff they would be appointed at the same level.University of Otago Honorary Clinical Titles (Clinical Lecturer, Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer, Honorary Clinical Associate Professor, Honorary Clinical Professor) are awarded to persons who are of high standing in the health professions, usually with good to very good academic records. Usually they would be employed in primary healthcare, District Health Boards or other parts of the health sector. The level of appointment will be dependent on the person having such academic and professional eminence that were they a member of the permanent university academic staff they would be appointed at the same level.University of Otago Honorary Enterprise Fellows are executives, entrepreneurs, innovators or experts who make a distinguished contribution to the mission and activities of the University.In exceptional circumstances, the University will consider awarding Honorary Academic Titles to persons not employed in another University who have not been employed as academic staff members at the University of Otago. In such cases, Departments will be required to demonstrate that the person has such academic and professional eminence that were they a member of the permanent university academic staff they would be appointed at the same level.The title will be awarded for an initial term of one year, and reappointment will normally be for a term of one to three years.It is not normal University practice to award Honorary titles to persons who are external co-supervisors of post-graduate students.Current academic employees of the University of Otago may not be awarded an Honorary Title.The University retains the right, at its discretion, to withdraw the award of this title if it considers that the individual is not acting in the spirit of the appointment or brings the University into disrepute. Decisions on withdrawal of the title at Professorial level will be made by the Vice-Chancellor on the advice of the Staffing Advisory Committee. Decisions on withdrawal of the title at all other levels will be made by the Staffing Advisory Committee.Approval procedure(a) The following documentation is required when seeking approval. Documentation required for all Honorary appointments: The Recommendation to Award the Title Form or a covering letter which provides the same information;CV of the applicant.Further documentation required when seeking approval to award the title of Honorary Academic Titles at Associate Professor level and above to persons not employed in another University: A written case, prepared by the Department, of not more than three pages providing evidence that the person's achievements are such that they would be appointed to the level sought. In the case of Associate Professor, Clinical Associate Professor, Professor or Clinical Professor, evidence of the quality of teaching, assessment and curriculum development, research and/or professional practice and service must be provided.

        "q3_response": "Based on the provided policy document, I have identified two policies with inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. The \"Approval procedure\" section (a, b, c) appears to contain procedures rather than policies. This section provides detailed instructions on how to seek approval for Honorary appointments, including what documentation is required and who is responsible for making decisions. While it outlines specific steps and guidelines for the process, its focus seems more procedural in nature.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any other inconsistencies or structural flaws in this policy document.",
        "q4_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified the following redundancy or incorrect structure of policies:\n\n1. **Redundant section**: The \"Approval procedure\" section (a, b, c) contains procedures rather than policies. This section provides detailed instructions on how to seek approval for Honorary appointments, including what documentation is required and who is responsible for making decisions.\n\n2. **Similarity in approval process**: The decision-making process for reappointments to Honorary positions previously approved by the Vice-Chancellor will be made by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic). This similarity suggests that there could be a more streamlined or standardized process for handling these situations.\n\n3. **Overlapping roles and responsibilities**: Some sections, such as \"Departments are responsible for arranging University usernames and/or ID cards (if required) to persons awarded honorary titles.\" seem to overlap with other sections, such as the responsibility of the person awarded the honorary title to obtain any necessary visas. While these sections serve similar purposes, they could be condensed or reorganized to avoid duplication.\n\n4. **Lack of clear escalation process**: The policy document does not clearly outline an escalation process for disputes or disagreements regarding Honorary appointments. It would be beneficial to include a clear statement on how such issues should be handled and who is responsible for resolving them.\n\n5. **No clear criteria for awarding Honorary Fellow, Honorary Associate Professor, etc.**: While the policy document provides detailed information on the procedures for seeking approval for different types of Honorary appointments, it does not clearly outline the criteria for awarding these titles. It would be beneficial to include specific guidelines or evaluation criteria for each title.\n\nOverall, while the policy document appears to be comprehensive and well-organized, there are some areas where redundancy or inconsistency could be improved.",

        "scope": "Corporate Records Services supports information management at the University. These guidelines apply to all public records created within the University, but the principles of records destruction and the methods of destruction are best practice advice for all types of information and records created by the University.\nCustodians are expected to work with Corporate Records Services and other areas that have specialist information portfolio responsibilities who can provide advice and assist them with meeting their responsibilities.",
        "content": "Principles of Records DestructionAuthorisedThe New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA) is our legal authority to dispose of our public records at the end of the appropriate retention period and when they are no longer required by the University. Note that the DA applies to all information regardless of format. While the GDA sets out the minimum period for retention, staff also need to ensure that there is no administrative, business or legal need to keep the information and record before commencing destruction (see Information and Records Disposal Process below for more information on the delegated authority framework for approving the disposal of information and records).AppropriateAny destruction of information and records ought to be irreversible and complete to prevent the information being recovered again and to ensure that there is no risk of accidental or unauthorised access to the records. Appropriately managed destruction should also consider the environment, and where possible information and records should be destroyed in an environmentally friendly manner, such as recycling both paper and microforms (see Methods of Destruction below).Secure/ConfidentialInformation and records should always be disposed of with the same level of security that was applied during their lifetime. Security during the disposal process can include the use of securely locked document destruction bins and a contractor who transports the records in a totally enclosed and locked vehicle. It may also be appropriate for particularly sensitive records to have an extra level of security applied to them at the disposal stage such as in-house shredding before being collected by a contractor for destruction.TimelyAlthough timely destruction ought to be balanced by the organisation's desire to retain information and records for longer than the minimum retention period in certain circumstances, it is important not to keep records for longer than is necessary. The timely destruction of information and records helps to aid retrieval efficiency and minimise storage costs, and it enables the University to focus on information and records of greater value. For information and records where a decision has been made to retain for longer than the minimum retention period, reasons for the decision should be documented to assist in their later disposal.DocumentedBecause proof of destruction may be required during the course of an investigation, or in response to an information access request, or as part of a recordkeeping audit, the destruction of all information and records must be documented. A certificate of destruction should also be obtained from the contractor and placed on a file together with any other destruction documentation. The type of information to be captured includes:The date when the disposal took place;The disposal authority that applies;Which information and records were destroyed; andWho took the action and their authorisation.Methods of destructionArchives New Zealand recommends the following destruction methods:For paper: Shredding: this method reduces paper documents to fine ribbons;Pulping: this method reduces paper to its constituent fibres, and if often recycled;Burning: this method should only be undertaken only in an industrial facility operating an enclosed incinerator and is not the most environmentally friendly option; andDry maceration: this method reduces materials to fine particles. Note: Burying or dumping paper records are not appropriate methods of destruction. Paper may take months or years to break down and may be uncovered at any time. Destroying sensitive information: If available - both pulping and dry maceration are most appropriate for highly sensitive material. Shredding is appropriate, but where possible cross-shredding should be used for sensitive documents. Densely packed paper does not burn well so burning ought to be a last resort for this type of material.For digital information: Delete documents from the digital system or application they are stored in.Identify other systems or applications where duplicate copies may exist. For example, a document in your shared drive, Microsoft Teams, or email.Ensure that any documents you have deleted have also been deleted from your computer\u2019s recycle bin.Information and Records Disposal ProcessIf you are carrying out a destruction process, please contact Corporate Records Services for advice about the correct approach for this. Corporate Records will assist you to identify information and records due for disposal Using the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA)If necessary, Corporate Records Services may ask you to complete the Request for Approval to Destroy Form (PDF)Please note that the information and records must not be the subject of a current or pending investigation or access request.Please ensure that the University no longer requires the information and records and they are not required under any other legislation.When correct destruction has been carried out this will be documented by Corporate Records Services.It is not necessary to document the process of disposing of your low-level, routine administration records, such as those records outlined in\u00a0the Managing Routine Business Information in the Office guidelines.List of information Custodians who have overall responsibility for information under their managementCustodians are expected to work with Corporate Records Services and other areas that have specialist information portfolio responsibilities who can provide advice and assist them with meeting their responsibilities.Please see the below list of Information Custodians, as noted in the University of Otago Information Framework.

        "scope": "These Guidelines apply to teaching events scheduled within the University's central electronic timetabling system, as maintained by Timetable Services, Academic Services.",
        "content": "General PrinciplesBarring special approvals as detailed in these Guidelines, students are expected to attend all scheduled teaching events in their course of study.In the first instance, the University shall seek to resolve any timetable clashes in a student's proposed course of study by assigning the student into alternative Teaching Streams.Timetable clashes which cannot be resolved by restreaming shall be assessed under two categories: Allowable Timetable Clashes (see clause 2 below);Exceptional Timetable Clashes (see clause 3 below).The University shall provide information for students on timetable clashes on its website and in other publications as appropriate.Where a timetable clash is permitted within a student's course of study, the student is expected to follow any directives or guidance provided by the University as to attendance at clashing events and/or the management of the timetable clash.Where a timetable clash arises from a change in the scheduling of events after a student is course approved, the University will advise the student on recommended courses of actions, which may include changing papers, but any such clash shall be considered approved if the student chooses to continue with their original course of study.The University reserves the right to decline a requested timetable clash in a student's proposed course of study.Allowable Timetable ClashesAn 'Allowable Timetable Clash' is defined as a timetable clash between teaching events, where at least one of the teaching events has pre-approved arrangements in place which can accommodate the timetable clash.The University shall maintain, and publish on the University website, a schedule of papers in which it is permissible for students to not attend some of the teaching events, and which may therefore form part of an Allowable Timetable Clash.Adding papers to the schedule of Allowable Timetable Clashes requires the endorsement of the relevant Head of Department (or their nominee) and the approval of the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or their nominee). Such adding of papers to the schedule shall not be used as a substitute for the appropriate timetabling of papers.When requesting that a paper or papers be added to the schedule of Allowable Timetable Clashes a department must provide justification as to why addition of the paper(s) to the Allowable Timetable Clash schedule is required.The schedule of Allowable Timetable Clashes will be reviewed on an annual basis.Tier 2 and 3 Course Approvers have the authority to approve or decline Allowable Timetable Clashes in a student's proposed course of study. An Allowable Timetable Clash should not be approved if it involves more than two teaching events at the same time.Normally only one Allowable Timetable Clash may be approved per student per week.In approving Allowable Timetable Clashes, the University may advise or direct students as to expected attendance at clashing events and/or provide advice on how the clash should be managed. This may include providing access to additional materials such as podcasts or other media.Exceptional Timetable ClashesAn 'Exceptional Timetable Clash' is any timetable clash between two teaching events which cannot be resolved by restreaming and which is not classified as an Allowable Timetable Clash under clause 2 above.All timetable clashes occurring in Summer School shall be treated as Exceptional Timetable Clashes.Students seeking to have an Exceptional Timetable Clash approved within their course of study shall be required to make an application, which shall include: the reasons as to why the clash is required within the student's proposed course of study;any actions that the student plans to take to manage the clash within the affected papers.Decisions as to whether Exceptional Timetable Clashes will be approved or declined shall take into account the student's academic background, study aspirations and proposed course of study. The following represent normal standards, deviations from which require sound academic reasons that should be recorded against the student's enrolment record: Exceptional Timetable Clashes should only be approved where both papers are major, minor or core degree requirements, or pre-requisites for major, minor or core requirements, and where non-approval may adversely affect degree progression;Exceptional Timetable Clashes should only be approved where the clash can be appropriately managed (access to alternative media such as podcasts may be taken into account);no more than one Exceptional Timetable Clash should be approved per student per week;the duration of an Exceptional Timetable Clash should be no longer than one hour per week;no Exceptional Timetable Clash should be permitted in a student's first year of university study;no Exceptional Timetable Clash should be permitted for any student with a Grade Point Average (GPA) in their previous year's study of less than 4;no Exceptional Timetable Clash should be permitted where a student's proposed course of study in the relevant teaching period exceeds 72 points for a semester.Exceptional Timetable Clashes are not permitted for students on Conditional Enrolment.If a student seeking an Exceptional Timetable Clash is a finalist, and the clashing papers are required to complete their degree, this should be given positive weight in assessing the clash but will not necessarily be the sole determining factor.Where further information is required to make a decision on the acceptability of an Exceptional Timetable Clash, staff involved in assessing the clash may contact the student to arrange to discuss their proposed course of study and academic background (e.g., by telephone or face-to-face).Authority to approve an Exceptional Timetable Clash request rests with Tier 3 Course Approvers in the relevant Department (or their nominee). Divisional Tier 3 Course Approvers or Tier 2 Course Approvers may be given authority by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) to approve Exceptional Timetable Clashes within specified categories.It is the responsibility of Heads of Department to ensure that appropriately qualified staff members are available during enrolment periods to make decisions on Exceptional Timetable Clashes within a reasonable timeframe (normally five working days).In approving Exceptional Timetable Clashes, the University may advise or direct students as to expected attendance at clashing events and/or provide advice on how the clash should be managed. This may include providing access to additional materials such as podcasts or other media.",

        "scope": "These guidelines apply to professional staff secondments which occur internally within the University. Secondments may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis.\u00a0\u00a0Fixed term employees are able to apply where the duration of secondment is less than the remaining period of their fixed-term contact.\nSecondments to external organisations and academic secondments are reviewed by the HR Director on a case-by-case basis.",
        "content": "1. When secondments are appropriate\nA secondment should be considered when there is a temporary vacancy and/or work to be undertaken that will provide opportunities for employees to: gain new skills and experience and acquire knowledge of other areas and rolesshare knowledge and provide expertiseutilise specialist skills and abilities for a particular project or taskbuild resilience and develop potentialdevelop leadership and project management skills. Secondment opportunities may arise during periods of organisational change, or project work, or to cover employee absences, or recruitment periods.\n2. When secondments are not appropriate\nSecondments cannot be used as a trial period before making a permanent appointment, or as a substitute for performance management, or problem resolution.\n3. Appointment Procedure\nThe recruiting manager should consider whether a position could be offered as a secondment before starting a recruitment process. The delegations for secondments are subject to the same delegation as for recruitment.Options for appointing to secondments of up to twelve month's duration are: Appoint a current employee for a period of up to 12 months to undertake the secondment by using the Direct to Offer process without the need to publicly advertise the vacancy.Advertise the secondment within their area or all of the University, inviting expressions of interest in order to provide a development opportunity for employees for a period of up to 12 months.Secondment opportunities of more than 12 months duration would normally be advertised within the University and be subject to the same recruitment process as a fixed term appointment.Employees wishing to apply for a secondment opportunity should discuss it with their substantive manager prior to applying.\n4. Points for a manager to consider when reviewing a secondment request\nIn determining whether an employee can be released to participate in the secondment, considerations will include the employee's professional development, the impact on the operation, the contribution to the University, and how the substantive role could be backfilled.Whilst the University supports substantive managers to release employees for secondment opportunities, in some instances this may not be reasonably done. For example, if there is important work that cannot be covered, or the employee has specialist technical knowledge that would be difficult to replace. When an employee is not released for a secondment, Managers are encouraged to explore alternative development and career options.Once a preferred candidate is identified the secondee and secondment manager should confirm the details of the secondment including duration, Performance and Development Review (PDR) processes and release plans with the staff member.\n5. Remuneration\nA secondment would not normally result in a reduction in salary level.\u00a0\u00a0However, there may be instances where the employee applies for a secondment to a lower level position for their own development. In this instance their salary will be applied in line with the Remuneration policy.If a secondment is to a higher level and the employee is on the Professional Staff Individual Employment Agreement or General Staff Collective Agreement, the Higher Duties Allowance provisions in those agreements will apply.If a secondee receives a Higher Duties Allowance and their substantive salary increases through the PDR process, then the Allowance must be reviewed.The Human Resource Director will consider remuneration for seconded professional employees on other employment agreements on a case-by-case basis.Where the secondment is at the same level, the employee will normally move across on the same salary. Future increases are managed via the PDR (Section 9).It is recommended that the remuneration is discussed with HR before any offer is made.\n6. Secondment Agreement\nThe Secondment agreement must have the appropriate delegated approvals and be completed by HR Services prior to the secondment commencing.\n7. Secondment Duration\nSecondments will normally not exceed two years. When the secondment covers a temporary absence, they will normally be for less than one year.\u00a0\u00a0If there are exceptional circumstances where the period of secondment might exceed these timeframes, advice must be sought from Human Resources.The term and notice period for a secondment can only be extended by agreement of all parties \u2013 the employee, and the secondment and substantive managers.\n8. Roles and Responsibilities\nSubstantive Manager During the secondment the substantive manager is responsible for maintaining regular contact with the secondee and keep them up-to-date on workplace developments or changes. This will ensure a smooth transition when they return to their substantive post.Secondment Manager During the duration of the secondment the secondment manager will be responsible for the allocation of work, supervision of their performance, and approval of annual and other leave.\n9. Performance and Development Reviews\nPrior to the secondment commencing, the substantive manager and the secondee will have a progress performance review for the period since the last formal review. The outcome of this review will be recorded on the PDR form.The secondment manager will meet with the employee at the commencement of the secondment to set their expectations and plans for development or training.During the secondment the substantive manager will normally have primary responsibility for the secondees PDR. In some instances, depending on the duration and location of the secondment and timing of the PDR, it may be appropriate for the secondee manager to be primarily responsible.\n10. Funding\nAll costs for the secondment including salaries, leave, training or development will be borne by the seconding department unless agreed otherwise. If the training is of benefit to both roles, then the allocation of the costs should be agreed on in advance.\n11. End of the Secondment\nThe secondee will return to their substantive post at the end of the secondment.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the end of the secondment, a meeting should be arranged between the employee and the substantive manager to discuss the implications of returning to their substantive position. It is recommended that the meeting takes place at least one month before the end of the secondment.At the end of the secondment period the secondee will revert to the pay and other terms and conditions of their substantive role. In some instances, there may be changes to pay as a result of PDR.A secondment can be ended early by either the secondee or the secondment manager by giving a notice period of not less than one month. If the secondee's substantive position is being filled during the secondment, the person filling the position must be aware that they may be given one month's notice, or less, if the secondment ends early.If the position that the secondee occupied or occupies becomes a permanent vacancy, the secondee will not have an automatic right to be appointed to that position.\u00a0\u00a0The secondee will be able to apply for the position as part of the recruitment process.",

        "content": "1. If you are transitioning\nIf you are transitioning when you commence employment with the University, or decide to transition during the term of your employment, there are a number of things to consider. We encourage you to prepare a transitioning at work plan (see Section 4).\u00a0\u00a0The University is committed to supporting any employee who is transitioning, and support is available to work through the list of considerations below.Think about what information you will like to share with people at work (your manager, colleagues, students, clients), when you would like to share it, and how you would like to share it. Equally, consider what information you would prefer to keep private. Disclosure should happen on your terms.Identify if there is anything that could have an impact on your employment, such as assistance you might require, the amount of leave you might need to take.To ensure a smooth transition we encourage you to arrange a meeting with your manager to discuss your transition at work plan. You are welcome to be accompanied by a support person, union representative, wh\u0101nau member, HR or Equity representative.The concept of gender transitioning may be new to some people and they might need time to educate themselves. This guide contains a list of external resources that might be of help to them.You can access the Employee Assistance Programme which is a free and confidential counselling service to help you during the process).\n2. If a member of your team is transitioning\nIf one of your staff members has disclosed that they are transitioning (or intend to transition in the future) your responsibility as their manager (and the employer's representative) is to support their transitioning at work. This includes addressing any issues that could affect the workplace. You may be asked to assist with communication to staff, clients or students.The concept of gender transitioning might be new to you, so please take appropriate steps to educate yourself about gender transitioning and what it means to be transgender: Allow the staff member to tell you about their individual experience.Refer to the External Resources section at the end of this guide for some recommended reading.Contact the Equity Office who can organise one-on-one training with the OUSA Queer Support Co-ordinator.The aim is to create an environment of support and respect and to prevent and/or appropriately deal with any issues. Many people have had a little or no experience with trans people. Lead by example to set the correct tone in the workplace. Be respectful, avoid making assumptions about the person, create a comfortable atmosphere, use the correct names and pronouns, and advise colleagues about using the correct names and pronouns.The staff member is encouraged to organise a meeting with their manager (you) to discuss their transition at work plan (please see Section 4 for what a transition plan can contain). Please ensure the staff member is aware they can be accompanied by a support person, union representative, wh\u0101nau member, HR or Equity representative during this meeting.Maintaining confidentiality is critical, so avoid disclosing your staff member's transgender status prematurely and without permission. Be open-minded and demonstrate understanding. The transition plan will help you to determine how best to communicate the staff member's transition to their colleagues, clients and/or students.You should not ask the staff member to provide you with a Medical Certificate, or any other similar documentation about their transitioning, unless it is required under the Sick Leave Policy.\n3. Meeting your legal and University obligations\nThe Human Rights Act 1993 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex. This includes a prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender and gender transitioning. The same prohibition is also in the Employment Relations Act 2000. Discrimination applies to almost all aspects of employment including job advertising, career progression and remuneration. It also applies to unpaid workers and independent contractors.Both employers and employees are obliged to exercise a duty of good faith, which includes being responsive and communicative and actively dealing with any issues that affect their employment relationship.All employees have the right to express their gender without fear of consequences. The University expects students and staff to display ethical behaviour at all times, to all members of its community. Breaches of ethical behaviour include discrimination on the grounds of gender transitioning and personal harassment and bullying. Refer to the University's Ethical Behaviour Policy.The University's core values encompass \u201crespecting and valuing others\u201d, \u201cequity in employment\u201d and \u201csupport for full and equal participation and outcomes for all groups in society\u201d. Refer to the University of Otago Strategic Direction to 2020.\n4. Developing a transitioning at work plan\nAs indicated previously in these guidelines, developing a 'transitioning at work plan' is a good first step in working through the process of transitioning while employed at the University. Below is a list of suggested topics that you might consider addressing in your plan.Communication: Who is going to be informed? For example colleagues, clients, students, collaborators.How they are going to be informed? For example by email or at a meeting. Will there be one announcement, or several?What information is going to be disclosed? This needs to be very clearly agreed to by the transitioning staff member.What information is to be kept confidential? This could be to just the staff member, or just the staff member and the manager.Who is going to make the announcement? For example the staff member, their manager, their HR representative.When will any announcement take place and how will it be phrased? The person who is transitioning must always be consulted before an announcement is made.How does the staff member want to manage any ongoing communication? For example, at different stages of their transition, or in relation to different work tasks/cycles (e.g. at the commencement of each semester)?Timeframes. It would be useful to document the dates or timeframes around when the staff member will: Assume their gender at work (e.g. be known by their new name, referred to by new pronouns, etc.)Adopt a workplace dress code to match their genderStart to use facilities such as restrooms and changing rooms which match their genderNeed to take time off work for medical treatments relating to their transition, if necessary, or to attend to any other matters directly associated with their transition.University Records that will need to be updated (see Section 5).Any other matters that need addressing, such as additional support required by the staff member and/or immediate team members.\n5. Updating University records\nAt the appropriate time during a staff member's transition, they are encouraged to update relevant University records. This section provides details on how to do so. (Note that this relates to staff records only. Students should seek advice from OUSA Queer Support.)Guide to updating University records for LGBTTIQA+ staff and students (PDF)Gender, Title and Preferred Name can be changed at any time (and without any evidence) by contacting Payroll Services. Gender options are Female, Male, Gender Diverse.Your Legal Name can be changed through Payroll Services by completing an IR330 form, and supplying evidence of your legal name change. You can download the IR330 form on the How to update your details webpage. Name in the University HR records will have to match your legal name in certain situations (e.g. when applying for an ACC payment due to work related accident). When you update your name in the HR system other university systems might get updated automatically (e.g. Ask IT or Library systems).You can apply for a new University ID card if it doesn't show the correct name/title or photo. Please find out how to apply for a new ID card.To update other places such as email address, University webpages where your name and/or photo appears \u2013 contact Information Technology Services with any email-related enquiries and Web Experience with any webpage enquiries.",
