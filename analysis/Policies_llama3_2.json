        "name": "Domestic_Violence_Policy",
        "scope": "The Policy applies to all University employees who are affected by domestic violence.",
        "content": "1. Background\nThe University is committed to taking all reasonable and practical steps within its power, to support and protect employees affected by domestic violence. The Domestic Violence \u2013 Victim's Protection Act 2018, provides legislative entitlements to employees affected by domestic violence, including; the right to apply for up to 10 days paid domestic violence leave per yearthe right to request a variation to their working arrangement<the right to be free from adverse treatment because they are, or are suspected of being a person affected by domestic violence.Furthermore the University has an obligation to ensure that all employees are safe at work. If an employee considers a threat to be real and serious, this should be reported directly to the Police. Call 111 if someone is in immediate danger.\n2. First Responders\nFirst responders are the Divisional HR Managers, HR Advisers, and members of the University Occupational Health team, who are trained to provide appropriate support to affected employees and to assist with the processes outlined in this policy. An affected employee can approach a first responder of their choice.\n3. Domestic Violence Leave\nAn employee's entitlement to apply for up to 10 days paid domestic violence leave annually, comes into effect at the time of appointment.An employee should treat domestic violence leave, as they would any other type of leave and seek approval beforehand (if that leave is anticipated) and if not, notify the University as soon as possible of their absence.If the employee has used their leave entitlement they can apply for additional leave.First responders or the employee's supervisor/manager can assist employees to apply for domestic violence leave.Requests for domestic violence leave require approval from the Director, Human Resources (HR Director).\n4. Variations to Working Arrangements\nEmployees affected by domestic violence have the right to request a short term (2 months or shorter) variation to their working conditions (for example, hours, days, and place of work) and/or how their contact details are managed.Requests require approval of the HR Director, who may seek line management input before making the decision to approve any requested variation.Requests must be made in writing but employees can ask a first responder, their supervisor/manager or any other person to assist them to write the request, or to write the request on their behalf.Requests must include the employee's name, place of work within the University, supervisor or manager's name and the variation they are seeking, including the start and end date for the changes.The University will try to accommodate requests whenever possible, but there are certain grounds on which an employer may refuse a request. If the University cannot accommodate the request, it will provide the employee with a clear written explanation as to why the request has been refused.\n5. The University's Response\nA response will be provided in writing as soon as possible and no later than 10 working days after receiving the request. The University will try to accommodate requests whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so.\n6. Other ways that the University can Support Employees:\nDevelop a safety plan for the workplace, which may include working with the Proctor and/or Campus Cop (see safety planning in section 9 for full details).Re-route salary payments to a different bank account number.Connect employees with specialist domestic violence support agencies (see full contact details below in section 9).Support eligible employees to access free counselling or the employee assistance programme ( EAP )\n7. Privacy for Affected Employees\nAny disclosure from an employee will be treated with the strictest of confidence.Information will be shared on a strictly need-to-know basis to protect the employee's privacy as much as possible.Domestic violence leave will be coded by payroll in a way that does not identify it as domestic violence leave.\n8. Raising a Complaint\nIf the employee has made a request under this policy and the University has not responded within 10 working days of receiving the request or has refused a request without explanation or has refused a request and relied on grounds that it cannot rely on, then the employee can raise a complaint with the mediation service (or Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment), the Employment Relations Authority or the Labour Inspectorate.An employee can raise a personal grievance if they believe that they have been treated adversely by the University because they are, or are suspected to be, a person affected by domestic violence. Details on how to raise a personal grievance are set out in the University's employment agreements.Alternatively an employee may raise a complaint with the Human Rights Commission.\n9. Safety Planning\nEmployees can contact the Proctor to discuss concerns about safety on Campus. The Proctor can assist in assessing risks and developing a safety plan that will address the individual's safety concerns, to the extent that it is reasonable and practicable to do so. The safety plan may include, but is not limited to, physical security on Campus, an emergency plan and the identification of a secure location on Campus.Employees can also approach a first responder and/or their supervisor/manager to assist them with the safety planning process.The University reserves the right to deny access to any part of/or all of the University's premises (including University provided accommodation) to perpetrators of domestic violence who are considered to be a threat to any member of the University community.",

        "q4_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified several redundancy or incorrect structures in the policy:\n\n1. **Cross-references**: Sections 6 and 9 of the 'Domestic_Violence_Policy' contain unnecessary cross-references to other policies (\"safety planning in section 9 for full details\") that do not provide additional information.\n\n2. **Procedure vs. Policy**: \n   - Section 4 ('Variations to Working Arrangements') contains instructions on how to request a variation to working conditions, which is more suitable as a procedure rather than part of the policy.\n   - Section 5 ('The University's Response') also contains instructions on how the University should respond to requests for variations to working conditions, making it another procedure rather than a policy statement.\n\n3. **Redundant sections**: \n   - Some sections may be overlapping or repetitive. For example, Section 8 ('Raising a Complaint') mentions mediation services and alternative channels for raising complaints. It might be more effective to condense this into a single section with clear guidance on who to contact and how to proceed.\n\n4. **Outdated or unnecessary information**: \n   - The mention of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) in Section 8 is outdated, as MBIE has been replaced by other organizations such as the Ministry for Employment and Workplace Relations.\n\n5. **Structural inconsistencies**:\n   - The policy jumps abruptly from discussing employee support to specific procedures like requests for variations to working arrangements and safety planning. A more logical structure might be to group related policies together or establish clear sections for each aspect of the policy.\n\nBy addressing these redundancy and structural issues, the policy can become more concise, easier to understand, and more effective in providing guidance for employees while also ensuring that procedures are clearly outlined."

Health, Safety and Wellbeing will contact WorkSafe if it is deemed a notifiable incident, injury, illness or fatality.\n2. Investigations\nRoutine investigations: The DHSO will investigate the reported event and record in Vault.The incident causation analysis tool within Vault will be completed as a part of the investigation to identify the root cause of incidents, so that corrective actions can be implemented to prevent recurrence as soon as possible, and,Any corrective actions are identified and recorded in Vault and allocated to an individual who has the responsibility to follow up with corrective actions to ensure the investigation process is closed.Formal investigations: Where events are high risk, a formal investigation will be conducted by a member of the Health and Safety team who has completed advanced investigation training.\n3.

This sentence could be rephrased without referencing Vault directly.\n\n2. Section '3. Confidentiality' contains a statement underlining that all reports will remain confidential to the University of Otago, with access limited to those persons tasked/responsible for reporting and investigation having access to personal information.\n\n   While it is a legitimate concern regarding data privacy, this point appears to be somewhat redundant as confidentiality is often implied in policy documents.

They must not solicit or accept gifts, rewards or benefits which might compromise their integrity and the integrity of their department and/or the University.As a general rule, University representatives should not accept a gift (whatever its nature or value) if the gift could be seen by others as either an inducement or a reward which might place the University representatives under an obligation to a third party.Where offers of gifts or inducements are made to a staff member, this should be reported by the staff member to his or her manager or Head of Department, who will determine the appropriate response. A staff member who accepts a gift should declare the gift to their manager or Head of Department for a decision on final disposal.Where offers of gifts or inducements are made to a Council member, this should be reported by the Council member to the Registrar and Secretary of the Council, who will determine the appropriate response. A Council member who accepts a gift should declare the gift to the Registrar and Secretary of the Council who will determine an appropriate response, in consultation with Chancellor or Pro-Chancellor as required. Legitimate and significant gifts will be recorded in a Council gifts register as required.Gifts or benefits can range from one-off offers of small gifts to ongoing discounts on goods and services. The line between token gifts of appreciation and those that might compromise the recipient is often not easily defined, but any gift (regardless of value or nature) where it could be seen by others as an open inducement or reward that might place the University under any obligation should not be accepted.The following factors should be considered in determining whether a gift/benefit may be accepted or not: the monetary value of the gift or benefithow the gift or benefit would look to an outside partythe reasons for the gift or benefit being offeredthe frequency of the gift \u2013 even a small gift or benefit given repeatedly may be of concernwhether the gift displays a company or organisation logothe value or importance of the gift or benefit to the employee, andthe commercial influence, actual or perceived, that the gift or benefit may represent \u2013 where a supplier has won a contract for the provision of goods and services to a department (or departments), the supplier should not offer personal discounts to employees of that department.

The \"Fraud_Policy\" also has a reference to external agencies, specifically:\n\t* The \"Audit and Risk Committee of the University Council\"\n\t* External agencies that may be referred for further investigation\n\nThis could be seen as unnecessary content, as it creates a separate layer of complexity and may not be directly related to the core policy.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these cross-references may seem unnecessary, they are often included in policies to ensure clarity and consistency with other relevant policies and procedures.

Risk Management Framework\nThe University adopts methodology consistent with the Risk Management Standard (AS/NZS ISO 31000:2009) for identifying, assessing and managing risks. This methodology is the basis of the University of Otago's risk management framework. It applies to both academic and service divisions and considers a broad range of operational, governance, quality, academic and financial risk.The framework ensures a consistent approach by different sections of the University. It also provides a structure for: communicating, mitigating and escalating risks, andincorporating risk management principles and objectives into strategic, operational and resource planning activities.As part of the framework the University shall carry out an ongoing programme of risk assessments across the University. The assessments are undertaken at operational and corporate levels on a quarterly basis and involve: an assessment of the extent, impact and likelihood of risk, andthe development of risk mitigation strategies to address risk.\n3. Responsibility for risk management\nThe University Council has overall responsibility for risk management and in exercising this function delegates: responsibility for oversight of risk management activities to its Audit and Risk Committee, andresponsibility for the implementation of the risk management framework to the Vice-Chancellor.The Audit and Risk Committee will: provide oversight to risk management activities across the University and its related entities and monitor the implementation of remedial actions to minimise or eliminate adverse risk, andreport at least quarterly to the Council on the performance of risk management activities (this may form part of a broader report on the work of the Committee).The Vice-Chancellor is responsible for: communicating significant risk issues to the Council and the Audit and Risk Committee as appropriate, anddelegates responsibility for ensuring that risk management practices are established and maintained in accordance with this policy to the Chief Operating Officer.The Chief Operating Officer has: delegated authority to ensure that risk management practices are established and maintained and that support and guidance is provided to the University community,responsibility for the operational management of risk management practices University-wide, andensures governance mechanisms effectively monitor risks and the way in which they are managed.Senior Managers ( DVC s, PVC s, Deans, Head of Departments, Directors) are responsible for: Recognition and disclosure of risks in their areas of responsibility.Maintaining and updating a Divisional risk register in accordance with University wide framework and risk management systems.Reporting regularly to the Vice-Chancellor on risk \u2013 immediately in instances where a significant new risk is identified.Ensuring that all major proposals (involving significant financial or reputational risk for example) submitted to the Council or any of its Committees for endorsement, indicate if a risk assessment has been undertaken (and if so whether contingency plans have been developed for any significant risk issues identified).Implementation of this policy within their respective areas of responsibility, specifically: quarterly updates of Risk Registers,undertaking risk assessments for all major commercial ventures, research and teaching initiatives, investment/ borrowing schemes and capital projects, andmaking training opportunities in risk management available to staff as appropriate to their position and role.Specific responsibilities include: PVC s/ DVC s: Risks associated with Faculty-specific academic and research matters, strategic relationships and structural matters.Chief Financial Officer: Financial risks and providing high quality financial information to those such as PVC s, DVC s, COO , HODs and Directors who are responsible for assessing risks in particular contexts.Director of Human Resources: Risks associated with employment and payroll.Director of Property Services: Risks associated with the University's insurance portfolio, plant and buildings, maintenance and use of rooms and physical resources.Director of ITS : Risks associated with information and communications technology, core ICT infrastructure, information systems, and ITS related security.Director of Health, Safety and Wellbeing: Risks associated with Health and Safety of staff, students, visitors and contractors as well as risks associated with biological, chemical, animal welfare and radiation compliance.The Director of Risk, Assurance and Compliance is responsible for: promoting and facilitating the implementation of formal processes to identify, assess, record and communicate operational and strategic risks that may impact on the University,the ongoing development of the corporate risk profile for the University,continuously monitoring action undertaken by the University to address significant risk issues, andproviding guidance and assistance to senior management and staff in fulfilling the responsibilities defined in this policy.All other management and supervisory staff are accountable for the timely and proactive provision of information to all those mentioned in (a) to (f) above which will allow those responsible for recognizing and disclosing risk in particular areas to carry out their tasks in the most informed manner possible.",

Procedure for negotiations of employment agreements\nThe University of Otago aims to treat all staff fairly and consistently.\u00a0\u00a0For the sake of consistency and efficiency, it endeavours to have as few variations of employment conditions as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of whether the individual or collective agreements are negotiated first, the University will aim to offer staff on similar employment agreements a variation to their agreement to closely reflect the changes to the other agreement, both in terms of remuneration and any other changes to terms and conditions.\u00a0\u00a0In recent years, the collective agreements have been settled first and have been followed by the individual offers.\nThe following section outlines how these changes are to be implemented unless otherwise agreed in the terms of settlement.\na. Collective employment agreements\nCollective employment agreements are agreements that cover two or more employees who are union members.\nFor staff on collective employment agreements, bargaining will be conducted by their unions on their behalf.\u00a0\u00a0Once agreement has been reached between the negotiating parties, the unions will undertake a ratification process to formalise the terms of settlement (i.e. what was agreed upon).\nThe resulting changes will be implemented as soon as practicable.\u00a0\u00a0The unions will be advised of the process for implementation including the pay date that any increases will be paid and when the new written Collective Employment Agreement is available. Depending on the timing and numbers of staff involved, there is likely to be a delay between the ratification and the implementation of any increase. Staff covered by a collective agreement (i.e. they would be a union member) and whose agreement with the University has ended would only receive any related backdated pay increase if they were employed at the time the University has been advised by the union that the terms of settlement has been ratified.\nThe following collective agreements are currently in place at the University of Otago:\nGeneral Staff Collective Employment AgreementAcademic Staff (non Medical/Dental) Collective Employment AgreementSchool/ECE Support Service Staff (College of Education) Collective Agreement\nb. Individual employment agreements\nIndividual employment agreements are agreements that cover one employee whose position is not covered by a collective agreement and/or chooses not to be a union member. The University operates a number of standard individual employment agreements.\nThe individual negotiations may take place either prior to or after the collective negotiations. The negotiations will normally be initiated by a letter of offer to the staff member. Staff will be given the opportunity to respond to the offer. Staff whose agreement with the University has ended (including through retirement, redundancies and settlements) would only receive any related backdated increase if they receive a letter offering the change in conditions.\ni.

Management band staff\nThe Vice-Chancellor will make a decision on whether or not it is appropriate to offer an increase to staff employed on Management Band Individual Employment Agreements.\n\n5. Placement of staff members on a pay scale and progression within a pay scale\na. Placement\ni. Academic staff\nDecisions on how to place new academic staff on the salary scale are made with reference to the definitions in the academic promotions policy. For staff in positions covered by the academic promotions policy, the appointment process can not be used to circumvent the requirements for academic promotion. Appointments to Associate Professor must be approved by the Staffing Advisory Committee. Appointments to Professor must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor.\u00a0\u00a0For academic staff being appointed to positions which are not covered by the academic promotions policy please refer to the relevant employment agreement for information about how decisions are made with regard to placement on the pay scale, or seek advice from Human Resources.\nii. General staff\nSection 6 explains the procedures for general staff who are paid on Scale 1 (the eight level salary structure which applies to most general staff).\u00a0\u00a0For other general staff, please refer to the relevant employment agreement for information about how decisions are made with regard to placement on the pay scale, or seek advice from Human Resources.\nb. Progression\nPlacement on a salary scale may be reviewed if this is provided by the employment agreement.\u00a0\u00a0Staff should refer to their employment agreement for information about salary progression.\ni. Academic staff\nThe salaries of academic staff are reviewed as defined in the employment agreement.\u00a0\u00a0Additional information is available on the Academic Progressions pages on the Human Resources website.\nii. General staff\nThe salaries of general staff on Scale 1 are reviewed on an annual basis as part of the Performance Development Review (PDR) process.\u00a0\u00a0For other general staff, please refer to the relevant employment agreement for information about how decisions are made with regard to placement on the pay scale, or seek advice from Human Resources.\niii. Fixed Term Agreements\nStaff on fixed term agreements will be considered for progression and promotion using the same processes as for permanent staff.\u00a0\u00a0If a new fixed term agreement is offered to the staff member, and a progression or promotion is approved, it will be effective from the date specified in the relevant progression or promotion process.\u00a0\u00a0Any consideration for promotion or progression, which would take effect after the end of the term of the agreement, shall not bind the University to provide employment beyond the term of the agreement.\niv. Secondments\nStaff on secondment will be considered for progression in both their seconded position and their permanent position, dependent on the timing of the secondment and the timing of the relevant progression process. For general staff please refer to the PDR guidelines. The manager for the secondment and the manager for the permanent position should agree how this will be managed at the time the secondment is arranged.\n\n6. Placement of general staff members on Scale 1 pay scale\nThe University operates an eight-level salary structure (Scale 1) applicable to most general staff, with Level 1 being the lowest and Level 8 being the highest.\u00a0\u00a0The decision on which level a position covered by this scale is placed on is made through the Job Evaluation system (see the Job Evaluation section 8).\nEach level is divided into two halves. The lower half is the appointment salary range and the upper half is the merit salary range. Each level has a series of defined salary steps. Staff can only be placed on the designated steps identified in the pay scale.\nPlacement on a particular step within the level will be based on the PDR criteria.\na. Procedure for appointment of external applicants within Scale 1\nA new appointee will be placed at one of the \u201cappointment steps\u201d within the appropriate level for the position. The appointment steps are marked in bold on the pay scale. Appointing to any other step in the appointment range is not permitted.\nPlacement of a new appointee on a particular step within the level will be based on the criteria used in the PDR. The manager will use information gained through the recruitment process to assess their experience, qualifications and levels of previous performance against the outcomes and competencies needed for the job.\nA factor managers should consider is how long they reasonably expect it to take for the appointee to achieve full competency within the University of Otago environment. Some indications may be provided by the experience and knowledge of the person(s) who are training, inducting and mentoring this person in their new role.\nSalary relativities should also be considered, i.e. what are the salaries of staff performing similar roles and their supervisors?\ni. Appointment range\nDivisional Heads, or those who have delegated authority from their Divisional Head, have the authority to appoint within the appointment salary range of the level based on their assessment of the new appointee during the recruitment process.\nA new appointee being offered a salary at the top of the appointment range will have demonstrated during the recruitment process that they were performing at a fully competent level in a similar position as defined by the PDR guidelines.\nii. Merit range\nIf a Divisional Head (Dean in Health Sciences) believes that a new appointee has demonstrated during the recruitment process that they are already capable of performing at an outstanding level as defined by the PDR guidelines, they may apply to the Director of Human Resources to appoint in the merit range.\u00a0\u00a0Agreement on the appropriate salary for merit appointments should be reached between the Divisional Head (Dean in Health Sciences) and the Director of Human Resources based on the assessment of the new appointee. The final decision rests with the Director of Human Resources.\nOther considerations for setting the level of appointment will include salary relativities and comparisons of performance outcomes within the Department, School, Division and University.\niii. New appointees without the minimum qualifications and/or experience\nIn rare circumstances where there are difficulties recruiting a suitable person, consideration may be given to appointing a candidate with potential but without the minimum qualifications and/or experience for the position.\u00a0\u00a0 In these circumstances, they may be appointed at a salary appropriate to their qualifications and experience with a specific development plan which must be put in place at the time of the appointment.\u00a0\u00a0This development plan will specify the performance criteria that the new appointee must meet in order to demonstrate the minimum qualifications and experience. This development plan will also detail the process and timing of assessment against those criteria.\u00a0\u00a0Once assessed as meeting the minimum qualifications and experience they will advance to the appropriate level for the position. A specific scale for salary progression for technical trainees is available.\nb. Salary considerations for current staff members being appointed to a new position on Scale 1\nAppointment to a new position would normally occur as a result of being appointed to an advertised University vacancy.\u00a0\u00a0Consideration should be given to placing the salary at one of the \u201cappointment steps\u201d within the appropriate level for the position.\u00a0\u00a0The appointment steps are marked in bold on the pay scale.\u00a0\u00a0 Please note that if the appointment is as a result of redeployment, the provisions of the Management of Change policy will apply.\ni. Appointment to a new position at the SAME level:\nAppointment range: Where the internal applicant's current salary falls within the appointment salary range of the new position, the applicant may be offered an increase in salary to an appropriate appointment step up to the top of the appointment range of the salary range of the new position subject to the following:\nThe appointee is to be assessed against the PDR criteria (objectives and competencies) for the new position. Placement within the appointment Range will be based on this criteria.Salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.Where the applicant's current position and the new position are similar, the applicant may be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above).\u00a0\u00a0Please note that if the appointment commences after 1 August, the staff member will not be eligible for a salary increase through the PDR the following 1 February.\nMerit range: As with external applicants, appointment in the merit range may only occur by application to the Director of Human Resources (refer above), with the following two exceptions:\nWhere an internal applicant's current salary falls within the merit salary range of the new position, the applicant may be appointed at the same step as their current salary provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities within the Department, school and/or Division.\nIf all the following conditions apply, the applicant may be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above).\nthe appointment is made between 1 August and 31 January; andthe applicant's current position and the new position are similar; andthe salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities with the Department, School and/or Division; andthe applicant would have received an increase through the PDR.\nii. Appointment to a new position at a HIGHER level\nAppointment range: Where the internal applicant's current salary falls below the salary range of the new position or within the appointment salary range of the new position, the applicant may be offered an increase in salary to an appropriate appointment step up to the top of the appointment range of the salary range of the new position subject to the following:\nThe appointee is to be assessed against the PDR criteria (objectives and competencies) for the new position. Placement within the appointment range will be based on this criteria.Salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.Where the applicant's current position and the new position are similar, the applicant will normally be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above).\u00a0\u00a0Please note that if the appointment commences after 1 August, the staff member will not be eligible for a salary increase through the PDR the following 1 February.\nMerit range: As with external applicants, appointment in the merit range may only occur by application to the Director of Human Resources (refer above), with the following two exceptions:\nWhere an internal applicant's current salary falls within the merit salary range of the new position, the applicant may be appointed at the same step as their current salary provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\nIf all the following conditions apply,\u00a0\u00a0the applicant may be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above)\nthe appointment is made between 1 August and 31 January; andthe applicant would have received an increase through the Performance and Development Review; andthe applicant's current position and the new position are similar; andthe salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\niii. Appointment to a new position at a LOWER level:\nWhere the internal applicant's current salary falls within the full salary range (appointment and merit ranges) of the new position, the applicant may be appointed at the nearest step above their current salary provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\nWhere the internal applicant's current salary falls above the salary range of the new position, the applicant shall transfer with a reduction in salary to an appropriate point within the salary range of the new position that is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division. Please contact Human Resources for assistance.\niv. Salary reductions\nIf the applicant's current salary is not consistent with the assessment against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position or with salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division, the salary may be reduced.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact Human Resources for assistance.\nv.Recruitment and Retention Supplements\nIf a staff member receives a recruitment and retention supplement, the supplement will be reviewed at the time of appointment to a new position.\u00a0\u00a0Normally the supplement will be incorporated into the staff member's new salary.\n\n7. Job Evaluation\nThe decision on which level a position covered by Scale 1 is placed is made through the Job Evaluation system.\u00a0\u00a0The Job Evaluation Committee will evaluate the job description, place the position into the appropriate salary level and determine the effective date of any change.\u00a0\u00a0The effective date of any salary adjustments resulting from Job Evaluation will normally be the date of receipt of the revised job description by Human Resources.\nFor recruitment purposes, the manager will decide whether a position should be submitted for Job Evaluation. Where substantial changes to a job description occur (i.e. one or more of the criteria used in Job Evaluation are significantly affected), the manager should apply to the Job Evaluation Committee for the position to be re-evaluated.\nAn application for Job Evaluation should include the following:\nthe new job description signed by the manager and the staff member(s),the job description as it was last evaluated or the job description of a similar evaluated position,a completed Job Evaluation Application form,an organisation chart.a covering memo detailing the reasons for the re-evaluation (optional but recommended),\nFor advice or assistance with Job Evaluation, please contact:\nHuman Resources Email job.evaluation@otago.ac.nz\na. Salary considerations for current staff members whose position is re-evaluated within Scale 1 to reflect changes in job content\nWhere significant changes to the substance of a job description occur, staff members and their managers may make application for the position to be re-evaluated (see above).\u00a0\u00a0The result of the re-evaluation may be that the position is placed in a higher level, the same level or a lower level.\u00a0\u00a0In transferring to a new salary level through Job Evaluation, the individual's current salary will not be reduced.\ni. Re-evaluation of a current position to a HIGHER level:\nWhere the position is placed in a higher level and the staff member's current salary falls below the salary range of that level or within the appointment salary range of that level, the staff member's salary will be increased to the nearest appointment step in the new level from the date that the re-evaluation takes effect.\nThe manager may, with approval from the Divisional Head (Dean in Health Sciences), offer an increase in salary to an appropriate appointment step up to the midpoint of the salary range of the revised position, provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the staff member against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the revised job description and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\nWhere the staff member's current salary falls within the merit salary range of the revised position, the staff member's salary will be increased to the nearest salary step in the new level.\nIf a staff member receives a recruitment and retention supplement, the supplement will be reviewed at the time of the re-evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Normally the supplement will be incorporated into the staff member's salary.\nii. Re-evaluation of a current position to the same level:\nWhere the position is placed in the same level and the staff member's current salary does not change.\niii. Re-evaluation of a current position to a LOWER level:\nWhere the staff member's current salary falls within the full salary range (appointment and merit ranges) of the revised position, the staff member's salary will be increased to the nearest step in the new level.\nWhere the staff member's current salary falls above the salary range of the revised position, the staff member will be placed on the highest step in the new level and will be paid a supplement to maintain their salary at their previous salary.\u00a0\u00a0This supplement will abate with general wage increases.\nb. Performance Development Review and Job Evaluation\nIf a staff member's position has changed and the subsequent Job Evaluation affects a staff member's salary level during the timeframe of the PDR process, the Head must decide whether salary progression is appropriate in the new level.\u00a0\u00a0As a general rule, if the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred before 1 August, and the staff's performance is reviewed against the changed position description, the PDR and revised objectives, then salary progression should be considered in the new level.\u00a0\u00a0If the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred after 1 August, the staff member's performance is reviewed against the old position description and therefore salary progression should be considered in the old level.\u00a0\u00a0For advice please contact:\nEmail hr.pdr@otago.ac.nz\nor\nEmail job.evaluation@otago.ac.nz\n\n8. Use of a Recruitment and Retention Supplement\nRecruitment and retention supplements may be applied to overcome demonstrated difficulties in recruiting and retention.\u00a0\u00a0Recruitment and retention payments will only be made for positions that are of strategic importance or where there are identifiable issues with obtaining staff for the normal University salaries.\nThe salaries offered by the University take into consideration two significant factors. The first is to maintain salary relativities between positions and people within the University.\u00a0\u00a0The second is to ensure, as far as is possible, that salaries offered are competitive with those offered by other employers in similar labour markets.\u00a0\u00a0From time to time the salary level may not be competitive. In such cases a recruitment and retention supplement may be required to attract or retain staff.\nFor recruitment purposes, the recruiting manager may apply for a pre-authorised recruitment and retention supplement.\u00a0\u00a0This must be approved before the possibility of a supplement is mentioned in advertising or in discussions with candidates.\nThe application form for recruitment and retention supplements is available online on the HR Forms page.\u00a0\u00a0Please email rrs.info@otago.ac.nz for salary information from New Zealand salary surveys, if required.\n\n9. Bonus payments\nThe University acknowledges that, from time to time, an additional monetary payment in the form of a bonus may need to be made to a staff member to recognise and reward the achievement of a certain specific task or set of tasks.\nThe University believes that the investment in a bonus payment should occur as soon as possible after the achievement of the particular task or set of tasks for which a bonus payment is to be made.\nThe policy and procedure for the payment of bonuses to general staff is available at the link below:\nBonus Payment Policy and Procedure\nFor academic staff, Pro-Vice-Chancellors may recommend a bonus in recognition of a significant, exceptional event which has not otherwise been recognised. Recommendations should be sent to the Vice-Chancellor and can be made at any stage throughout the year.\nBonus payments up to and including $1,500 per annum \u2013 General staffDivisional HeadBonus payments over $1,500 per annum \u2013 General staffVice-ChancellorBonus payments \u2013 Academic staffVice-Chancellor\n\n10. Salary information for recruitment purposes\nWhere an appointment range applies, the salary range for appointment will be quoted from the first appointment step to the top of the appointment range. The top of the range will also be quoted. For example: \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 Level 4 (Range for Appointments $41,574 to $46,157, Top of Range $50,738)\u201c.\nFor other positions, the full applicable salary range will normally be quoted, for example: \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 Lecturer/Research Fellow ($70,506 to $85,039)\u201c; \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 General Practitioner ($124,950 to $144,188)\u201c.\nFor Management positions the following statement will be used: \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 The University is offering a remuneration level commensurate with the responsibilities of the position, qualifications and experiences of the successful appointee.\u201c\nWhere it is not appropriate to advertise the salary range for any reason, including where a position is advertised prior to a confirmed Job Evaluation, no salary information will be provided in the advertisement on the University of Otago website.\nCandidates will be advised to contact either human resources or the department for information. If a Job Evaluation is subsequently confirmed, this may be edited during the advert posting.\nWhere the salary arrangements are complex (for example Joint Clinical Academic vacancies), a statement may be included below the advert text on the University of Otago website.\na.Recruitment and retention supplement information in vacancy information\nThe potential use of a recruitment and retention supplement should be identified prior to advertising. The statement below may be included below the advert text on the University of Otago website if deemed appropriate. This statement should be used EXCEPTIONALLY and only for positions where a recruitment and retention supplement has been pre-authorised (see above). Discussions regarding the use of the statement should be held with Human Resources before a decision on its inclusion is made.\n\u201cThere is a possibility that the University may award a non-superable payment additional to salary to assist recruitment, in respect of this position. Any such payment will be reviewed on an annual basis.\u201d\n\n11. Employee benefits\nThe University of Otago is committed to attracting and retaining the best employees. The University therefore offers a range of benefits and discounts for staff members from superannuation subsidy and retirement planning to health and travel insurance and a number of other services and discounts both within the University and external businesses in Dunedin.\nEmployee benefits of working at the University of Otago\n\nAppendix 1: General staff Scale 1 appointment points\nDownload the General Staff Scale 1 Appointment Points",

        "name": "Travel_and_Travel_Related_Costs_Policy",
        "scope": "This Policy applies to all staff, students, Council members and any other University representatives travelling at the expense of the University.\u00a0\u00a0Where this Policy conflicts with the terms of an individual employment contract, the employment contract will take precedence.",
        "content": "Please note that this document is currently under review.\n1. General guidelines\nTravel and accommodation expenditure should be economical and efficient, having regard to purpose, distance, time, urgency, personal health, security and safety considerations. The principles of a justified business purpose, and moderate and conservative expenditure, are particularly relevantSimilar principles of justification to those above in (a), should be applied to the environmental cost of travel. In particular, the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from air travel on climate change should be considered carefully.Where a provision in this policy is inconsistent with the provisions in an employment agreement, the employment agreement will apply.\n2. Travel approvals\nBefore booking travel, travellers and travel arrangers should ensure that they have obtained the necessary approvals as required by their respective divisional travel approval processes. Domestic Travel \u2013 Expenditure for domestic travel is to be approved by the relevant cost centre Manager or approved delegate.International Travel \u2013 Staff and other University representatives must obtain prior written approval, that includes an estimate of costs and any external funding, for all international travel from: the Chancellor (in the case of the Vice-Chancellor and Council Members)the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee (in the case of the Chancellor)The Pro-Chancellor (in the case of the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee)in all other cases, the relevant member of the Senior Leadership Team ( SLT )As part of any domestic or international travel approval application, travelling staff members must have a contingency plan for work in case of disruption developed and accepted by the approver.\u00a0\u00a0Contingency plans are encouraged for other University representatives where appropriate.Should there be any unavoidable cost increases between approval and when the booking occurs, re-approval will not be needed. However, any scope change to the original travel request such as an additional route, additional accommodation, or different class of travel, will require re-approval by the applicable approval authority\n3. Travel insurance\nUniversity travel insurance is required to cover all international travel.\u00a0\u00a0In booking this insurance, please be advised that: While travel insurance currently covers medical costs arising from COVID\u201119, non-medical disruption insurance only covers up to $200 per day with a maximum of $1,400 in total (i.e. If the traveller is delayed or required to isolate due to COVID\u201119 at some point on their journey).The department/unit will be expected to cover any additional travel disruption related costs (such as accommodation, meals and transport) in excess of the $1400 travel disruption insurance provision outlined above for University travellers and therefore the approver should carefully consider the relevant risks and whether the potential costs can be justified.Staff and University representatives should also be aware of the possibility that permission to travel by the University may be rescinded at short notice if COVID\u201119 conditions change in New Zealand or overseas, and that insurance will be withdrawn if the destination country is placed on the Government's no-travel advisory before the journey commences.The risk level of each destination must be checked on the NZ Government website Safetravel. Where the rating for a country is: Do not travel \u2013 travel is not permitted unless approved by the Vice-Chancellor;Avoid non-essential travel \u2013 travel is not permitted unless approved by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head.Safetravel websiteOn receiving approval to travel, the Financial Control team, in the Financial Services Division, must receive notice from any University representative who is approved to travel to a \u201cdo not travel\u201d or \u201cavoid non-essential travel\u201d destination. This is to allow a specific travel insurance policy to be established covering the additional requirements imposed by these ratings. Email fsd.insurance@otago.ac.nz\n4. Air travel\nAll air travel should be booked in accordance with the University's Travel Planning Procedures.Travel should be booked well in advance so the expenditure is the most cost-effective available.Economy class must be used for all journeys for which payment of fares is provided by the University. Any exception requires the prior approval of the Vice-Chancellor, subsequent to endorsement by the staff member\u2019s direct manager and Divisional Head, or the approver specified under clause 2(a) ii 2-4 for senior University representatives.Where an external organisation has agreed to pay, or reimburse the University, for a university representative to travel at a class above economy, either by paying the full cost of the travel or the full cost of the upgrade, the University representative must provide evidence of this before the travel is confirmed.Staff and other University representatives are able to personally pay the cost of any upgrade above economy class on the condition that they provide evidence of their payment before the travel is confirmed and the upgrade does not result in any additional costs to the University. Payment by University representatives could include the use of personal air points or other personal rewards.The use of Airpoints or other reward schemes to purchase flights, upgrades, or other goods and services, cannot be reimbursed by the University.\n5. Visas, Inoculations and Passports\nVisas, individual country electronic travel authorisations (e.g. ESTA) and inoculations required for University travel will be funded by the University.Visas, electronic travel authorisations and inoculations obtained for any private travel undertaken in conjunction with University travel will not be funded by the University.Passport costs for either new or renewed passports will not be funded by the University.\n6. Travel club and reward programme memberships\nUniversity payment for membership of Air New Zealand Koru Club must be pre-approved by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head, or by the approver specified under clause 2(a) ii 2-4 for senior University representatives using the Koru Club Membership Pre-Approval Request Form. Applications for university-approved Koru Memberships will only be considered where it can be demonstrated that the staff member or other university representative concerned is expected to make a total of nine return international or domestic trips on Air New Zealand each year as part of their University duties.Once approval has been obtained, this form should be attached to the PCard payment/statement in Finance One as part of the Koru Membership purchase transaction.University payment for membership of other travel clubs will only be approved where it can be demonstrated that for University-related purposes, the staff member or other University representative concerned has no option other than to spend considerable time travelling on airlines other than Air New Zealand or its affiliates, and can demonstrate that access to lounges or services as part of such travel essential to their health and wellbeing.Staff who are not eligible for University funding of Koru Club membership, may join in a private capacity and receive the benefits of the University's corporate membership. Further information can be found in the Air New Zealand Contract information document located within the Approved Supplier webpage.Air New Zealand contract information (PDF)The University will not pay for any travel-related reward programme, except where this is included in the base membership fee for an approved travel club membership.University funded memberships should not be for a period longer than one year as membership is personal to the individual and not held by the University.\n7. Accommodation\nStaff and other University representatives staying with relatives or friends as an alternative to using commercial accommodation may pay compensation per day to their hosts up to a value that does not exceed 25 per cent of the cost of commercial accommodation room rates per day in the locality where the staff member is transacting their University business.The University has approved the use of the \u201cAirbnb for work\u201d programme as an accommodation option.\u00a0\u00a0Bookings for this accommodation type must be made through the MTA as described in the Travel Planning Procedure.The University will not pay for mini-bar costs, other than in exceptional circumstances.The University will only pay the costs of laundry and dry cleaning where the business travel exceeds 14 days (excluding Research and Study Leave).\n8. Food and drink\nIn the absence of any contrary provision in employment or other agreements, the cost of meals will only be reimbursed or provided during the period that the staff member is away from their home location on University business.Guidelines on meals and alcohol are contained in the University's Sensitive Expenditure Procedure and Guidelines.\n9. Motor vehicles\nVehicles should be rented from the University\u2019s approved rental car suppliers using either the supplier\u2019s web reservation system (with payment made via the travellers\u2019 PCard), or via the University\u2019s MTA (which can be charged back to the University via the MTA\u2019s consolidated invoice). If the appropriate vehicle is unavailable, then from mainstream rental car providers at the most cost-effective rate.The most economical and environmentally friendly (i.e. lowest greenhouse gas emissions) type and size of rental car should be used, consistent with the requirements of the trip including the distance to be driven, the terrain and the number of people and type and quantity of goods being carried.Private use of a rental car is not permitted except in exceptional circumstances, such as reasonable out-of-work-hours use when the staff member or other University representative is away from home and undertaking work for the University. In such cases, the University representative must reimburse the University for any additional costs arising from the private use.The University will not pay for travel by private motor vehicle where travel by other means is more practical or cost-effective and has better or similar greenhouse gas emissions, such as flying or renting a vehicle. Where private motor vehicles are used for University business, staff members or other University representatives will be reimbursed at the lower cost of the rental equivalent (including petrol costs) or mileage.The use of taxis (including Airport Shuttle Services and ride sharing apps) should be moderate and cost-effective relative to other forms of transport available to the university representative.The University will not pay for taxis to be used for travel between the staff member's home and their usual place of work unless this is allowed for in the staff member's employment agreement.All fines for parking and traffic offences incurred by staff members or other University representatives while using a rental or private vehicle on University business will be paid by the staff member or other University representative. Under no circumstances will fines or other penalties be paid by the University.Staff are not permitted to use commercial e\u2011scooter services (e.g. Lime Scooters) for work purposes.\n10. Travel to/from the University representative's local airport\nWhen travelling to/from the University representative's local airport, the University representative is encouraged to adopt an airport transfer transport option that is both appropriate and cost effective.\u00a0\u00a0Options for transfer include the use of shuttles, taxis, ride apps, e.g. Uber, and the individual's private vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0When considering local Airport transfer options: (in order of preference) Travel by private motor vehicle to local airports which will be reimbursed to the shuttle equivalent rate and associated parking charges while the vehicle is parked at airport, or by shuttle.If the University representative is unable to travel to the airport in their car or the shuttle, the use of taxis or ride apps, due to cost, requires prior approval from the relevant authority as specified under clause 2 (a) above.\n11. Tipping\nThe University will only pay the costs of tipping in countries or localities where tipping is local practice and the tip is reasonable.Tipping in New Zealand will not be paid for or reimbursed under any circumstances.\n12. Communications while travelling\nThe University will only pay for internet or WiFi use where it is directly required for business purposes.It is expected that staff or other University representatives will use the most cost effective method of communication.Except in cases of emergencies, the University will pay for one phone call of up to 5 minutes in length or up to 5 texts per day to a staff members or other University representative's family.\n13. Private travel linked with University travel\nStaff members and other University representatives may undertake private travel before, during, or at the end of travel paid for by the University, provided that there is no additional cost to the University and that the primary purpose of the travel is business related.All the costs associated with the private travel, including travel insurance, must be paid by the Staff member or other University representative.Any work time used for private travel must be booked as annual leave before the Staff member leaves the University. When authorising annual leave, managers should consider the benefit of linking several activities together in one trip rather than creating more emissions by undertaking several trips.\n14. Persons accompanying University representatives\nUnless specifically provided for in other University policies, the University will not pay the travel costs of persons accompanying a University representative unless that person clearly contributes to the University business being conducted [by the University representative].Accompanying travel to be paid by the University must be pre-approved by the Divisional Head, with approval from the Vice-Chancellor or the Chief Operating Officer as applicable; or by the approver specified under clause 2(a) ii 1-3 for senior University representatives.\n15. Stopovers\nStopovers shall normally only be paid by the University if they have a clear business purpose or are required to make an onward travel connection that is part of the University travel.Stopovers to be paid by the University, other than those required to make an onward travel connection, must be pre-approved by the Divisional Head. Stopovers relating to the travel of Divisional Heads and other senior University representatives must be approved in line with the approval structure set out in clause 2(a) ii.\n16. Disputes procedure\nIn the event of a dispute relating to this policy arising between staff members and their Head of Department or Divisional Head, either party may refer the matter to the Director of Human Resources for review.",

The Responsibilities of students policy also contains multiple cross-references to other University policies and systems without providing their content directly in the policy.\n3. Both policies primarily focus on outlining responsibilities for staff and students rather than providing detailed information or guidelines.\n4.

        "name": "Performance_Development_Review_Policy",
        "scope": "This Policy applies to all Professional staff as defined in section 3 of this Policy.",
        "content": "\n1. Principles\nThe aims of the PDR process are to:Focus staff on appropriate professional development opportunities.Produce agreed goals for staff and appropriate support to achieve them.Encourage an effective working relationship between a staff member and their manager based on an honest and open exchange of views.Provide the staff member with an opportunity for a Salary Review with someone who has first-hand knowledge of their work.Align staff knowledge, skills and development with the strategic direction of the department and the University.Ensure there are no surprises during the formal PDR .Ensure a regular Review of job performance over the previous 12 months.\n2. Timeframe\nThe PDR year starts at the completion of the formal PDR Review and ends at the time of the next annual review.The formal PDR Review meeting happens once a year between 1 August and 31 October.All PDR forms are completed and signed by the Reviewer, Reviewee and Head by the dates set by the University but no later than the end of the Calendar year.Salary Review outcomes are decided by the dates set by the University but no later than the end of the calendar year.Regular Progress Reviews are required to be scheduled throughout the year.\n3. PDR eligibility\nThe  PDR  Policy applies to those staff who:Are permanently employed on either the General Staff Collective Employment Agreement, Professional Staff Individual Employment Agreement or the Management Band Individual Employment Agreement and have been employed since 31 July in the Review year.Are employed on fixed term agreements and have worked for 3 months or more. If the fixed term agreement ends before 1 February and it is unclear whether the position will be funded on 1 February, a review should still be completed. This shall not however bind the University to provide employment beyond the terms of the current agreement.Staff are not eligible for salary increases if they have worked less than 3 months or, they have left the organisation or, they will not be continuing employment within the University beyond 31 January of the following year.The PDR process can be used for staff not included in the above, e.g. short-term fixed-term, casual employees. However, these staff will not be eligible for salary increases through this process.Completing a  PDR  Review is compulsory for eligible staff.\n4. Changes to role\nIf a staff member's position changes and/or is re-evaluated at a new level during the Review period, the following applies;i.if the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred before 1 August, the staff member's performance is reviewed against the requirements for the new or changed role.ii.If the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred after 1 August, the staff member's performance is reviewed against the old position description.\n5.Assessment\nOutcomes and Competencies are the key tools for assessment of performance and defining areas for development.Outcomes An outcome is what has been achieved as assessed against a predetermined set of tasks, functions or responsibilities. They may be sourced from a range of areas including job descriptions, PDR meetings, policies, or practices.Expected outcomes are what staff are expected to achieve during a Review period.Competencies The competencies focus on the way or manner in which the outcomes can be achieved.The University has 8 generic competencies:Knowledge and SkillsTeamwork and Co-operationOrganisation, Planning and Self-ManagementProblem Solving / Decision MakingService to CustomersInitiative and InnovationLeadership and People ManagementNg\u0101 Taonga Tuku Iho / Language and CultureEach competency is made up of a series of descriptors of performance or behaviour. These are described in detail in Appendix 1 \u2013 Competencies.For the purposes of the PDR it is expected that: The majority of the competencies will apply when describing the level of staff performance. Some may be of more significance depending on the role.Not all the competency descriptors would apply to each position or to a particular outcome.\n6. Performance levels within competencies\nWithin each competency there are five performance levels:OutstandingExceeds ExpectationsFully CompetentWorking Satisfactorily towards Full CompetenceRequires ImprovementDefinitions of performance levelsOutstanding Consistently achieves all their outcomes as described in the \u201coutstanding\u201d performance descriptors. The Key outcomes are recognised as exceeding the normal expectations for the role. Exceeds Expectations Achieves some outcomes that are recognised to be beyond the requirements of the role as described in the \u201coutstanding\u201d performance descriptors for key competencies, and balanced with outcomes achieved at the \u201cfully competent\u201d level for other competencies. Fully Competent Achieves all expected outcomes to a high standard as described in the \u201cfully competent\u201d performance descriptors. Performance assessed at this level is considered as meeting normal expectations for the role. Working Satisfactorily toward Full Competence Achieves some expected outcomes and demonstrates full competence in some areas as described in the \u201cworking satisfactorily towards full competence\u201d performance descriptors. Development is required in some areas of the role but progress towards \u201cfully competent\u201d is evident. Requires Improvement Does not achieve some expected outcomes; performance is as described in the \u201crequires improvement\u201d performance descriptors. Development is required in some key areas of the role but improvement is not evident Exceeds Expectations DescriptorsUnlike the other levels, Exceeds Expectations does not have a set of descriptors of the performance level (refer Appendix 1). This level is met by demonstrating all the relevant descriptors in the Fully Competent performance level and some of the relevant descriptors in the Outstanding performance level. The proportion of outstanding outcomes will increase as the staff member progresses up the scale.The level of Fully CompetentThe expectation is that all staff will attain the level of Fully Competent. They will do this by progressing through the Appointment steps within the Appointment range. The number of Appointment steps will vary depending on the level of Appointment and initial placement within that range.Once the level of Fully Competent is achieved it is expected that this will become the minimum standard of performance.Changes in Assessment across ReviewsIt may not always be possible to sustain an assessment at the higher levels of Exceeds Expectations and Outstanding over time. Therefore, there may be movement within the levels of Fully Competent, Exceeds Expectations and Outstanding over time, e.g. someone assessed as Outstanding one year may be assessed as Exceeds Expectations or Fully Competent the following year.Service to the University Community and/or Service to the Wider CommunityService to the University and wider community is not a requirement for professional staff, but a number of staff are involved in activities that benefit the University, and this kind of contribution needs to be acknowledged and valued. It is an additional positive factor which should be taken into consideration when assessing the level of performance.Service can cover a very wide range of areas and includes all activities which are voluntary and not part of the job description. To be considered, the activities must benefit the University and should not detract from the staff member's ability to do their job. Listed below are examples of the types of activities that could be considered as community service: Fostering positive links and better understanding between the University and groups such as local papatipu r\u016bnanga, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu and ng\u0101 Iwi M\u0101ori;Membership of University committees such as the Operational Health and Safety Committee, or divisional and departmental committees;Supporting a professional association or staff grouping e.g. the Technicians' Forum, Staff Women's Caucus etc;Acting as a contact person under the Ethical Behaviour Policy.Territorial or St Johns Ambulance serviceA lack of relevant community service is not a negative factor as it is essentially a voluntary activity and not everyone has the opportunity to contribute in this way.\n7. Parties involved in the PDR\nThe person who manages the staff member's work directly will normally be the main Reviewer.A Reviewer should have responsibility for a manageable number of Reviewees. If the number of reviewees exceeds what is reasonably manageable then alternatives must be considered. Consideration may include delegating, shared or assisted reviews, or other alternative ways for completing the PDR .It may be appropriate for the Reviewer to be supported by a more senior manager in completing the PDR .In some situations, it may be appropriate to invite someone with additional knowledge about the performance to participate in or contribute to the Review. This should be discussed in advance of a Review meeting.\n8. Support People in the PDR review\nEither party has the opportunity to bring a support person to the Review meeting. This could be, for example, a colleague, wh\u0101nau support or a union representative. There may be a variety of reasons why a staff member would like a support person.If a support person is to be involved, the parties participating in the Review should discuss and clarify in advance what their role in the meeting will be. For example, a support person might provide support but not speak during the session, or they may provide prompts to help provide information.\n9. The formal PDR meeting\nThe formal PDR must be completed before 31 October. The requirements for the Review meeting are:The Reviewer will give the Reviewee at least one week's notice of the Review meeting, offer the opportunity to bring a support person, and ensure adequate opportunity to prepare.The Reviewer should arrange a suitable place for the PDR meeting.In the Review meeting, the parties will discuss the staff member's performance in terms of expected outcomes and competencies.The parties will discuss the overall assessment of the staff member's performance. The Reviewer will consider all the information discussed at the meeting before finalising the decision about the overall assessment of performance.If the Reviewer believes that more information is needed before a decision can be reached, a second meeting can be arranged and plans made to obtain the necessary information.A work and development plan will be developed for the next year.The parties will set regular dates for progress reviews over the next 12 months.The Reviewer will write up the PDR form.The Head, if not the Reviewer, and the staff member have an opportunity to make additional comments in the PDR Form.The completed form will then be signed by all parties and copied to the Reviewer, the staff member and the departmental personnel file. This should be completed by the end of November.\n10. Salary review\nThe standard salary increase will depend on the specific scale that applies to a position.\u00a0\u00a0For example, for roles on Scale 1 the standard Appointment Range salary increase is one step and in the Merit Range three steps in Levels 1-3 and four steps in Levels 4-8.NOTE: for staff on Scale 1: As of 1 February 2023, eligible staff on Scale 1 will automatically receive a Standard increase if they are eligible for a PDR, and not on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), or part of a formal process, or at the top of the scale or off the scale.For all other salary scales, please refer to the criteria for movement relevant to each scale.If a staff member\u2019s performance is assessed as Requires Improvement, appropriate support and a development plan will be put in place to assist with an improvement in performance.Accelerated Salary IncreasesAn Accelerated Increase is two steps and may be considered in either range when a performance level of Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding is given. Accelerated Increases are reserved for exceptional performance.Reviewers will need to submit a case for consideration and approval by the Divisional Head. Approved Accelerated Increases will need to be sent to the HR Promotions and Remuneration team for review and processing.Management Band IncreasesThe Management Band scales are set out in ranges. The criteria and level of salary increases are outlined in the Management PDR Guidelines.\n11. Support during the PDR process\nFor the Review to be successful, it is important that the parties maintain a respectful and constructive working relationship. A range of support is available to assist with the process including providing advice on staff development opportunities or skills-based training, development plans and objective setting.Support is available at any time. Working on the principle that there should be \u201cno surprises\u201d during the formal PDR , it is better that the support options are called on when the need is first identified \u2013 this is more likely to be during one of the progress meetings prior to the formal PDR .People available to provide advice and support at any stage include, but are not limited to, colleagues, senior staff in your Division, the Divisional HR Managers, the Head of Organisational Development, the Equity Manager, Union Representatives and the University Mediator. These staff may be able to help directly or suggest other people or options. These resources are available to all campuses.\n12. What to do if a disagreement should arise\nIf a disagreement should arise between the parties during the Review, parties will be encouraged to resolve it themselves using the options outlined in section 11 as this allows them to keep control of how they manage their working relationship.If, at the end of the process, there is a significant ongoing disagreement that is likely to take a medium to long term period to resolve, it is recommended that staff invite an appropriate third party to facilitate a constructive discussion to help both parties reach an agreement. This could be any person that both parties believe has the knowledge and personal skills to help resolve the disagreement and who is willing to assist in this way. Support and facilitation mechanisms available include your Manager, the Divisional HR Managers, the Head of Organisational Development, the Equity Manager, Union Representatives and the University Mediator.\n13. Appeal\nThe outcome of the PDR Review can only be appealed on the grounds that the PDR process has not been followed and that the failure to do so affected the outcome of the Review.An appeal to the Director Human Resources may be lodged by either the staff member or their Reviewer.The deadline for appeals is the date set by the University but will be no later than the University's last working day of the calendar year.Staff should be informed of the outcome of their appeal within a month of lodging the appeal. If there is any delay in informing staff of the outcome of their PDR salary Review, either party may apply for the appeal deadline to be extended.The Director, Human Resources will decide on how the appeal will be considered and make the final decision on the outcome.If the appeal is upheld, the parties will be advised of the outcome and instructed on the actions that need to be taken. This may require that the process is repeated with appropriate mentoring and supervision.\nAppendix 1: Competency criteria\n The University of Otago is committed to and will recognise bicultural competencies. This may mean staff demonstrate across some/all of the competencies:\nAn appreciation/understanding of Te Ao M\u0101ori and its expression in the University's M\u0101ori Strategic FrameworkA commitment to and knowledge of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/The Treaty of Waitangi (and how it applies to your job/position)An understanding of M\u0101ori values (and iwi aspirations) and how they can be applied in the workplaceA demonstrable commitment to the principles of the M\u0101ori Strategic Framework\n1.

        "name": "Parental_Leave_Policy",
        "scope": "This policy applies to all employees at the University who have it referenced in their employment agreement.",
        "content": "Legal entitlementsThe legal entitlements to parental leave are contained within Parts I to V of the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987.The terms of this policy reflect the minimum legislative requirements, and are supplemented with additional entitlements offered by the University.EligibilityAll University employees covered by this policy are entitled to unpaid leave under the provisions of this policy.To be eligible for the paid parental leave provisions the employee must have an employment agreement that extends at least six months beyond the date they propose to return to work from parental leave.Maximum leave entitlementParental leave of up to 52 weeks may be granted, including any paid period agreed to by the University.The maximum 52 week period of parental leave may be taken by the primary carer exclusively.Leave may also be shared between the primary carer and their partner, as outlined in clause 4 below.The two-week paid leave entitlement for partners employed by the University is in addition to the 52-week total entitlement, but no individual may take more than 52 weeks in total.Access to the University\u2019s parental leave provisions does not affect the individual\u2019s entitlements under the government\u2019s paid parental leave provisions.Types of parental leavePaid Primary Carer Leave Primary Carer Leave is paid leave of up to 12 weeks available to the Primary Carer of a child based on their normal pay rate and FTE applying prior to their taking leave.A temporary reduction of hours during the last few weeks of pregnancy does not affect this rate, and the paid leave may be taken at any time during the period of parental leave.The primary carer can choose to share this leave entitlement with their partner if their partner is also an employee of the University and they are sharing responsibility for caregiving in the 12 months following birth or adoption.Special Leave An employee who is pregnant is entitled, before taking up Primary Carer Leave, to take a total of up to ten days special leave without pay for reasons connected with their pregnancy.An employee who is adopting a child is entitled, before taking up Primary Carer Leave, to take a total of up to ten days special leave without pay for reasons connected with the adoption.Special leave is also available to partners.Partner\u2019s Paid Leave Partners of primary carers are entitled to take up to two weeks (ten days) of paid leave based on their pay rate and FTE applying immediately prior to their taking leave.This applies whether the primary carer works for the University or not.Partner\u2019s leave may be taken in a block, or in any configuration that suits the family and is agreed with the department.The entire entitlement must be taken within the allowed parental leave period (52 weeks).Birth Parent Leave Birth Parent Leave is unpaid leave that can be taken by a birth parent up to six weeks before their due date.Extended leave Extended leave is any other period of leave during the first 12 months after the birth or adoption, beyond the initial period of Paid Primary Carer Leave.This leave can be taken by a primary carer, or shared, and can take the parental leave total to a maximum of 52 weeks.Terms and conditions for ex-gratia payment and paid leave optionsWhere an employee meets the terms and conditions, they can apply for the University\u2019s Parental leave payment provision as an ex-gratia payment, instead of paid leave as above.An employee, who has taken parental leave, but chosen not to take the paid leave option, may on return to work qualify for a payment equivalent to the amount of leave taken (maximum 12 weeks), based on their normal pay rate and FTE applying prior to their taking leave. A temporary reduction of hours during the last few weeks of pregnancy does not affect this rate.Application must be made within six months of an employee\u2019s return to work. Approval of applications outside this timeframe and/or the terms and conditions will be at the discretion of the Director of Human Resources.Any ex-gratia payment approved will be paid after the employee has returned to work.Application for either the Ex-Gratia payment or the Paid Primary Carer Leave alternative will require the employee\u2019s written agreement to repay a pro-rated sum if they resign or do not otherwise return to work after the leave period and complete a further six months continuous service. In this eventuality, the sum that must be repaid to the University by the employee will be calculated based on the length of time that the employee has been back at work and expenditure incurred.The Director of Human Resources has the discretion to waive the requirement to repay the paid parental leave/ex-gratia payment on compassionate grounds, on written application from the individual.The application must have the approval of the relevant Head of Department, Manager or Dean.Where the expiry date of a fixed-term agreement is less than six months from the return to work from parental leave, the employee will not in the first instance be eligible for any payment. However, if a further appointment is offered and accepted, application can then be made.Any paid parental leave entitlements for research funded employees, which cannot be met within the research group, should be funded by the host Department and supplemented, if necessary, by financial support from the Division or School (in Health Sciences).An employee who is absent on paid parental leave for less than twelve weeks can receive payment only for the number of working days absent.Job protectionWhile on Parental Leave an employee\u2019s job must be kept open unless a redundancy situation occurs under a Management of Change process, or the job is a key position and a temporary replacement is not reasonably practicable.The employee\u2019s job may be filled on a temporary basis.Service entitlementsFor the purpose of calculating leave entitlements, service while on parental leave is unbroken.Annual leave and sick leave will accrue while an employee is on parental leave.Subject to the employee returning from parental leave, payment of such leave will be calculated based on their normal pay rate and FTE applying prior to their taking leave.Time on leave should not affect seniority or status including eligibility for consideration for promotion or progression.Should an employee not return from parental leave, annual leave for final pay purposes will be calculated in accordance with the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987. The last day of employment and last day of annual leave accrues until the employees last day of work prior to commencing parental leave.RedundancyThe University is required to take into account the possible loss of paid parental leave when compiling the redundancy package for a pregnant employee who has applied for parental leave and has, or would have had, the application approved, and to compensate the employee accordingly.Reduced hours prior to commencing leavePregnant employees preparing to go on parental leave may wish to work reduced hours during the last few weeks of work before their intended departure, for reasons directly related to the pregnancy.Changes to work hours should be discussed and negotiated with the relevant HoD/Dean/Manager, and a Change of FTE / Hours form completed.Return to workAn employee absent on parental leave is required to give at least one month\u2019s notice in writing of their intention to return to work.Employees returning from a period of parental leave may wish to work reduced hours for a period or take up a part-time position within the University.Departments are encouraged to take a sympathetic view of employees\u2019 circumstances and have regard to the University\u2019s policies on Equal Employment Opportunities and Flexible Working Arrangements when negotiating variations to normal working hours, either before the period of leave, or on return to work. Any agreement reached should protect the best interests of the parent/s, child and the department.Employment while on parental leaveEmployees are only permitted to work a limited number of keeping in touch days while on any form of paid parental leave (either from the Government or the University), and only in agreement with the University.Keeping in touch days cannot take place within the first 28 days of leave and cannot exceed 64 hours during the total period of parental leave.If any work is undertaken in the first 28 days, or if the total number of hours exceeds 64 hours, the employee will be considered to have returned to work.\u00a0\u00a0However, this does not apply to leave taken while qualifying for or receiving Government preterm baby parental leave payments.Any such work should be initiated by the employee and must not be confused with a graduated return to work.A person\u2019s right to have their job protected in accordance with the Parental Leave and Employment Protection Act 1987 will not be diminished by them undertaking part-time work during parental leave in accordance with this section.Employees should be protected from pressure to work while on unpaid leave. Human resources will be available to help both the employee and the department reach an agreement that protects the best interests of the parent/carer, child.Not returning to workAn employee who decided not to return to work from parental leave is required to provide the normal period of notice as per their employment agreement, or 21 days\u2019 notice, whichever is the greater.Re-employment within the University after absence due to childcareApplications for re-employment from employees who have taken parental leave under the terms of this policy but resigned from the University to care for an under school age child or children will be given full consideration provided that the applicant has the necessary skills and qualifications to competently fill a vacancy which is available in the University.Application under this provision must be made to an advertised vacancy within four years from the date of resignation, that is, prior to the sixth birthday of the child for whom the employee was the primary carer.Where the above criteria are met and provided that the individual has primarily been involved with caring for their preschool aged children (that is, has not been in regular paid employment) then departments are encouraged to shortlist these applicants.Application under this provision is at the discretion of the applicant. It is their duty to alert selection panels to their application under this provision; otherwise, no concession will be made.Flexibility and variations to policyEmployees are encouraged to take up the various kinds of leave available that best suits their needs.Any leave plan must comply with both the University\u2019s policy and current legislation.Negotiation with the Head of Department or appropriate manager should also take place to ensure that the best interests of the department are protected as far as possible.Small or under resourced departments which do not have the ability to offer any flexibility must be assisted by the Division or School (in Health Sciences) to provide flexible working options, either through financial support, or by sharing resources from elsewhere in the Division or School.The Director, Human Resources has the discretion, under exceptional circumstances, to authorise variations to the parental leave policy. Any application for variation to the policy should be made in writing to the Director, Human Resources, and, if appropriate, should be endorsed by the Head of Department, Manager or Dean.Application for leaveNotice of intention to take any type of leave under the Parental Leave Policy for a birth parent or their partner or spouse.

        "name": "Annual_Leave_Policy",
        "scope": "All staff employed by the University of Otago, excluding casual and student employees.",
        "content": "1. Responsibilities\nIndividuals are responsible for ensuring they take all their annual leave and that leave is recorded using the correct procedure on the Staff Web Kiosk.\nHeads of Department / Managers are responsible for ensuring that staff in their area have sufficient opportunity to take all their annual leave. It is acknowledged that our relationships with other agencies, such as the DHBs, may complicate our ability to do this.\nNote: There are a small number of special cases where the use of the Staff Web Kiosk is not applicable; these will be known to the areas involved and alternative recording systems are to be used.\n2. Annual Leave Definitions\nAnnual leave entitlements are outlined in each staff member's employment agreement.\nAnnual leave accrues during the course of the year and becomes an entitlement on 1 December each year, for use during the following 12 months.\n\nAnnual leave accruing throughout the year is called \"accrued leave\".\nWhen the accrued annual leave is allocated on 1 December it becomes the \"leave entitlement\" to be used within the following 12 months.\nAny previous leave entitlement not used by 30 November is \"carry forward leave\" e.g. any portion of the leave entitlement allocated on 1 December 2004 that has not been taken by 1 December 2005 (excluding the new entitlement allocated 1 December 2005 ).\n\nNote: The term \"leave accrual\" used by Financial Services refers to the balance of accrued leave, leave entitlement and carry forward, at a point in time.\n3. Managing Leave\nHeads of Department or Managers should monitor staff member's leave balances and the amount of leave taken and should ensure that all staff are provided with an opportunity to take their full annual leave entitlement for the year.\nStaff should have the opportunity to have at least one continuous two week break each leave year.\nWhere a staff member has a carry forward balance greater than 10 days then the person will take annual leave from the first normal working day following 1 January in the following year for a period sufficient to reduce the carry forward balance to 10 days, unless the Divisional Head or Dean (where applicable) expressly agrees otherwise in writing (this approval must be copied to Payroll Services).\nFor staff with clinical responsibilities the leave will be taken at the first available opportunity following the New Year, taking into account any rostered clinical duties.\nIf agreement is not able to be reached regarding the taking of annual leave, Divisional Heads or Deans (where applicable) may require staff to take annual leave. In this case as much notice as possible should be given to the staff member and not less than four weeks. The Divisional Head / Dean should write to the staff member, outlining the dates that the leave is to be taken. A copy should be sent to Payroll Services who will then book the leave into the Staff Web Kiosk.\n4. Taking Annual Leave\nProvided there is sufficient leave available, annual leave requests will be granted whenever possible, taking into account the needs of the Department.\nWhere it is necessary, budget holders should make appropriate provision in their staffing budget to provide coverage for employees taking annual leave throughout the year.\nStaff are able to anticipate annual leave ie take accrued leave before it becomes an entitlement. This is subject to their Head of Department's approval.\nIf a person resigns and has a negative annual leave balance, it is expected that the balance owing will be deducted from the final pay.\nWhere an employee or a person dependent on them becomes sick, or bereavement occurs when an employee is on annual leave or long service leave, then the employer will permit the period of sickness to be debited against their sick leave entitlement, provided a medical certificate is produced for the sick leave. This is in accordance with the University's employment agreements.\nAnnual leave recommences once the sick person is well again or the bereavement leave period is over, provided it was within the timeframes for which annual leave was originally sought. The leave records must therefore be updated to reflect the change in leave taken. This will require the employee completing the Leave Reversal Request on the HR website.\n5. Close Down\nWhere a close down period is observed between Christmas and New Year, or during some other time during the year, it is expected that staff take annual leave at that time.\nStaff who do not have enough accrued leave at the time of the close down period will either use their annual leave entitlement in advance or, if they wish, leave without pay will be granted.\nIn exceptional cases, where it is essential, a Head of Department may need staff to work during the close down. It is expected that the Head of Department will seek volunteers prior to requiring any individual to work.\n\nHeads of Department should seek the approval of the Division Head or Dean (if applicable) prior to requiring staff to work during a close down.\nPayroll Services must be advised when any staff member works during a close-down period.\n\nIn relation to staff with clinical duties with a District Health Board, the close down period does not apply. In this circumstance, people are not expected to be on annual leave from the University and will be paid in the usual way. Payroll services should be advised who is working.\n6. Annual Leave Recording and Approval\nAll requests for annual leave will be entered into the Staff Web Kiosk system by the person who intends taking the leave.\nFilling in the Staff Web Kiosk should take place after a discussion has been held with colleagues and the Head of Department or Manager and, if applicable, any other relevant agencies with whom the individual works, such as a District Health Board.\nLeave requests are to be entered into the Staff Web Kiosk prior to leave being taken.\nLeave requests must be considered by the person with the delegated authority to approve the leave.\nThe administrative process of approving leave within the Staff Web Kiosk may be delegated to another staff member (for example, a department administrator). In this case the person with delegated authority to approve leave must still consider the request and there must be an auditable record of the decision (ie approved or declined) held within the Department.\nLeave requests booked in the Staff Web Kiosk will escalate if not attended to within 96 hours of submitting.\nIf a staff member goes on leave without entering the leave in the Staff Web Kiosk the Head of Department may direct Payroll Services to record the leave.\nWhere a staff member is taking annual leave from 1 January, in accordance with the carry forward provisions, this leave record will be entered automatically by Payroll Services, where the individual staff member has not already done so.\nIf a leave approver is away, temporary delegation of leave approval within the Staff Web Kiosk can be made by contacting the HR Technical Team.\nWhere booked leave is not taken or where circumstances change, annual leave bookings can be changed by downloading and completing the Leave Reversal Request on the HR website.\n7. Delegations of Authority\nDelegations of authority for all types of leave can be found in the Leave Delegated Authorities Policy.\n8.

        "name": "Cotutelle_Arrangements_Policy",
        "scope": "This policy applies University-wide.",
        "content": "1.Overview\nIt is intended that cotutelle arrangements will be an expression of ongoing, strategically driven research collaboration between Otago and the partner university. Cotutelle arrangements will be established only where there is evidence that the collaboration provides educational and professional benefit to candidates and draws on existing research relationships that are of strategic interest to Otago. There should be evidence of established and substantial research collaboration between Otago and the proposed partner institution.Cotutelle arrangements are primarily a means for promoting research, not a process for recruiting doctoral candidates. The initiative for such arrangements is therefore not taken by a candidate. Rather the objective is to allow collaborative research teams from Otago and a partner university, that have found a high calibre PhD candidate, to propose jointly to their respective universities that a cotutelle project be established.\n2. Criteria for Establishing a Cotutelle Arrangement\nWhile it is not necessary for an institution-to-institution collaboration agreement to already be in place in order to establish a cotutelle arrangement, the proposed supervisors must provide evidence that ongoing and sustained research collaboration has taken place and is sufficient to support a PhD candidate.A cotutelle arrangement may only be established with the approval of the Joint Administrators (as defined in clause 4 (a)) after consultation with the relevant Pro- and Deputy Vice-Chancellors or equivalent senior officers at each institution. The Otago Graduate Research Committee must be satisfied that the collaboration will provide educational and professional benefits to PhD candidates and is consistent with the strategic directions of the University of Otago.A proposed cotutelle arrangement must be approved by the Head of the relevant department or school at the University of Otago.The University of Otago Graduate Research Committee must agree that there is an appropriate level of research collaboration, infrastructure support, and capacity for continuity of doctoral supervision at each university before approving a cotutelle arrangement.Due consideration must be given to the climate change impact of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with any additional travel required due to a cotutelle arrangement.\n3. Principles Governing Cotutelle Arrangements\nA formal cotutelle agreement must be drawn up between the two participating institutions in respect of each candidate. It will detail the particular arrangements pertaining to that particular candidate, including time to be spent at the two universities.All the normal regulatory requirements for an Otago PhD degree must be met in every respect.Throughout the cotutelle arrangement, the candidate will continue to be enrolled as a full-time PhD candidate at the University of Otago and is therefore subject to the University of Otago's regulations, rules, and policies.The primary supervisor must be a University of Otago staff member.The candidate must be accepted for admission at the University of Otago prior to the establishment of a cotutelle arrangement.A cotutelle arrangement must be proposed by the candidate's Otago supervisor and be formally established no later than the end of the first year of enrolment. Cotutelle agreements normally take effect from the beginning of a candidate's enrolment.The Otago Administrator will set out in a letter to the candidate all of the special arrangements that will apply to their cotutelle. This will include: a copy of the cotutelle agreement; the names of the supervisors and the Joint Administrators; the periods to be spent at each university; and other relevant matters.The cotutelle candidate will comply with Otago's progress reporting requirements as specified in the Handbook for PhD Study.Departmental resources to support the candidate and the research project, including travel, must be in place before the establishment of the cotutelle arrangement. Measures must be in place to minimise the climate change impact of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with travel.There is to be a single examination process, the successful outcome of which would be the award of the PhD from the University of Otago although the partner university may wish to also award a separate degree. The University of Otago will not award a double-badged (joint) degree.\n4. Joint Administrators\nThe Dean of the Graduate Research School at Otago and their counterpart holding this position at the partner university will act as Joint Administrators of the cotutelle arrangement.The Joint Administrators will share responsibility for ensuring that the conditions necessary for the continued operation of the candidate's cotutelle arrangement are satisfied.Should the progress of the cotutelle candidate fall below a satisfactory level, the Joint Administrators will consult. The Joint Administrators may recommend that: the candidature may continue with conditions; the candidate should transfer to an appropriate programme at one or the other university; or the candidature should terminate.\n\n\n\n                .register-container {\n                    display: flex;\n                    gap: 50px;   \n                }\n                .button--colour-primary-b {\n                    gap: 5px;   \n                }\n            ",

The policy could be condensed or rewritten to make it more self-contained and accessible to a wider audience.\n\n2. **Joint Administrators Policy**: While this policy is concise, it assumes the reader's familiarity with the Dean of the Graduate Research School at Otago and their counterpart at the partner university. This assumption may not be universally applicable, and the policy could benefit from being more explicit about its requirements.\n\n3. **Cotutelle Arrangements Policy (again)**: Upon reviewing the policy again, I notice that it contains a section on \"Principles Governing Cotutelle Arrangements\" which appears to be a list of rules or principles governing cotutelle arrangements. However, this section is not clearly separated from the rest of the policy, and its relevance to the other sections may not be immediately apparent.\n\n4. **Joint Administrators Policy (again)**: This policy seems to contain some redundant information regarding the roles and responsibilities of the Joint Administrators. Specifically, the sentence \"The Joint Administrators will share responsibility for ensuring that the conditions necessary for the continued operation of the candidate's cotutelle arrangement are satisfied\" is not clearly connected to any specific rule or principle.\n\n5. **Lack of clear categorization**: The policies seem to be related to each other but do not explicitly state their relationship. It would be helpful to include a brief description of how each policy relates to others, especially for those who may not be familiar with the context.\n\n6. **Unclear language and formatting**: Some sections of the policy contain technical terms or jargon that might be unfamiliar to non-experts. This could make it difficult for readers to understand the policy without additional context.",
        "q4_response": "After carefully reviewing the provided policy data, I have identified several redundancy and incorrect structures in the policies:\n\n1. **Redundant cross-references**: Policies such as Cotutelle Arrangements Policy contain multiple instances of cross-references to other policies (e.g., \"clause 4 (a)\") and references to external documents (e.g., \"the Handbook for PhD Study\"). These can be removed or replaced with clear summaries to make the policy more self-contained.\n\n2. **Procedure vs. Principle**: Policies such as Cotutelle Arrangements Policy and Joint Administrators Policy contain procedures rather than rules or principles. While these procedures are necessary, it would be beneficial to separate them from the main policy text and label them clearly as \"procedures\" or \"guidelines.\"\n\n3. **Lack of clear categorization**: The policies seem related to each other but do not explicitly state their relationship.

Consider reorganizing them into a single, comprehensive document that addresses all aspects of cotutelle arrangements and Joint Administrators' roles.\n\n8. **Remove unnecessary words and phrases**: Some sections of the policy contain unnecessary words or phrases (e.g., \"the following policies are considered to have unnecessary content\"). These can be removed to make the policy more concise and easy to read.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the policies can become clearer, more concise, and easier to understand for readers."

It is engaged with external groups, such as government, industry, iwi/M\u0101ori, community, and has national and/or international collaborations. Recognition as a University of Otago Research Centre signals the excellence and coherence of the research and leverages support for the research conducted by the group.A University of Otago Research Centre provides outstanding training opportunities for early career researchers and students and may support coordination of activities not readily undertaken within the University's department and divisional structure.While a University of Otago Research Centre may be awarded funding by the Research Committee, the title of and recognition as a University of Otago Research Centre is not dependent on such funding.The Vice Chancellor may in exceptional circumstances, and on the recommendation of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research & Enterprise), approve an University of Otago Research Centre to be designated as a University of Otago Research Institute. Approval will take into consideration the characteristics of the University of Otago Research Institute and the rationale for the designation.University of Otago Research Themes The purpose of a University of Otago Research Theme is to promote and facilitate communication and new types of research collaborations among its members, including academic staff, research staff and graduate research students. A University of Otago Research Theme signals an area where there are research strengths in the University that, with co-ordination, might sustain or incubate promising interdisciplinary research directions.A University of Otago Research Theme provides unique training opportunities for students and may support co-ordination of activities not readily undertaken within the University's department structure.A University of Otago Research Theme signals an area of demonstrated or developing research excellence. By giving particular recognition and support, the University is signalling that University of Otago Research Themes will: develop a pathway to increase national and international leadership and recognition for excellence;increase interdisciplinary and collaborative contributions to a research field;have the potential to attract external research income.University of Otago Research Networks A University of Otago Research Network operates in an area where there are research strengths that with co-ordination might translate into further interdisciplinary research, shared expertise, and/or real-world impact.A University of Otago Research Network provides knowledge-sharing and training opportunities for all its members through activities that may not usually be readily undertaken within the University's traditional departmental structures.A University of Otago Research Network signals an area of research significance. By giving particular recognition and support to this, the University is signalling that a University of Otago Research Network has the potential to: increase interdisciplinary and collaborative contributions to a research fieldattract external research incometranslate research findings into real-world impact through knowledge sharing with external stakeholders.Funding periods and allocationsProposals to establish University of Otago Research Entities are invited from time to time by the Research Committee. Funding is awarded at the discretion of the Research Committee.University of Otago Research Centres University of Otago Research Centres will be established for up to five years with up to $50,000 funding per annum.

Eligibility for a Dedicated IT Workstation\nThe following types of IT Workstation users will be allocated a dedicated University of Otago IT Workstation while they remain in that user type:All University of Otago academic and professional staff, with roles that require it, will be allocated a dedicated IT workstation. Note that Other University of Otago staff not allocated a dedicated IT Workstation should have access to a shared IT Workstation with their DepartmentAny thesis (PhD and Masters by thesis) student may request a standard IT Workstation based on justified need.No contractors will be allocated an IT Workstation, as it is expected that they provide their own device.Other users not eligible as staff or students may be allocated an IT Workstation on written justification from the Divisional head.Eligible users will be allocated one Dedicated IT Workstation.Dedicated IT Workstations are expected to be used for work and study related tasks.\u00a0\u00a0IT Workstations not being used for this purpose are to be returned to ITS.On completion of employment, enrolment, or agreement, all allocated IT Workstations and all associated peripherals must be returned to ITS.Requests for additional dedicated IT workstations will need written justification from the user\u2019s Departmental Head to be uploaded with the request.\n3. Requesting IT Workstations\nAll requests for IT Workstations are to follow the IT Workstations Procedure.Requests for enhanced IT Workstations and/or peripherals (from the standard catalogue) will need to demonstrate justified need.Non-standard IT Workstation or peripheral requirements (outside of the standard catalogue) will need to demonstrate justified need with that need confirmed by the Departmental head.Additional approvals from ITS may be required as detailed in the IT Workstations Procedure.Eligibility criteria for accessing enhanced and non-standard IT Workstations will be maintained and regular audits performed by ITS to ensure fair application of criteria.Requested Shared IT Workstations:Requests for additional shared IT Workstations will require written business justification to be uploaded with the request as per the following table: Request for Justification from\n             Additional teaching IT Workstations \n          \n             Divisional Head \n          \n             Additional meeting or signage IT Workstations \n          \n             Divisional Head \n          \n             Additional shared departmental IT Workstations \n          \n             Departmental Head \n          Where appropriate, it is expected that teaching IT Workstations be available to any University users.Where a request for additional shared IT Workstations is for multiple machines, the request may need approval from the IT Workstation Budget Authority.Replacement of shared IT Workstations will follow standard replacement policy as per Section 4.Requesting Research IT Workstations:Requests for additional Research IT Workstations will require written justification from the Departmental Head, with exception to those detailed in Section 6(b).It is understood that occasionally computers are bundled in with specialist equipment and it is impractical to separate them. The request form must still be completed so that management processes can be applied.Replacement of Research IT Workstations will follow standard replacement policy as per Section 4.\n4. Replacing IT Workstations\nIT Workstations and monitors will be replaced by ITS on a cycle as per the following table:CategoryLifespan\n           Laptop or desktops \n        \n           5 years \n        \n           Monitors \n        \n           10 years \n        \n           Tablets \n        \n           No specified lifespan \n        \n           IT workstation peripherals other than monitors \n        \n           No specified lifespan \n        Research environment equipment may be retained to operate with attached instrumentation for as long as required and may not be replaced on any particular cycle. The retention of this equipment may be subject to restrictions for security reasons.Once an IT Workstation reaches the agreed lifespan, it should be replaced within 3 months. If there is no specific lifespan, then the item will be replaced only when ITS deems it fails the \u2018Fit for purpose\u2019 criteria as specific in the IT Workstations Procedure.Please note that the lifespan may differ from the Depreciation Estimated Useful Life specified in the Assets Procedure.Evidence of continued need may be required.Requests will be considered to replace an IT Workstation that is still within its prescribed lifecycle with evidence that it no longer meets the specific needs and goals of the user.An IT Workstation (or components of an IT Workstation) will be replaced with either new or repurposed items as seen fit by ITS.Any IT Workstation that is replaced must be returned to ITS.\n5. Ownership of IT Workstations\nAll IT Workstations will be centrally owned and managed by ITS.Any IT Workstations that are no longer needed are to be returned to ITS.\n6. Purchasing of IT Workstations\nAll IT Workstations will be purchased by ITS.Exceptions for external research funding sources:Where research funding or other funding sources are available to support the purchasing of IT Workstations either fully or partially, these funds will be recovered by the central funding ledger.IT Workstations purchased by the University of Otago, regardless of budget source, will be centrally owned by ITS though it is recognised that in some cases, the funder retains ownership of the purchased equipment.If the research project is completed and there are no conditions from funders to retain equipment ownership, all purchased IT Workstations under that research project will be returned to the central pool for redeployment or disposal unless the research continues, and the IT Workstation is still being actively used for that research purpose.If the staff member leaves the project while the research project is still ongoing, the equipment will be redeployed to the replacement staff rather than being returned to the central pool.\n7. IT Workstation Asset Management\nAll IT Workstations must be auditable at any time, for the purposes of asset management reporting, software management, IT support activity, and cyber security risk compliance.IT Workstations must be easily identified as a University IT asset for the purposes of auditing and support.",

        "content": "1. Introduction\nThe purpose of this policy is to promote the public interest: by facilitating the disclosure and timely investigation of matters of serious wrongdoing in or by the University, andby protecting people who disclose in accordance with the Act (hereon referred to as a Discloser).The Act requires organisations such as the University to have internal procedures for receiving and dealing with information about serious wrongdoing in or by the organisation.The Act also provides that the identity of a Discloser and the contents of any protected disclosure (as well as any other person who discloses information in support of or relating to a protected disclosure), will remain confidential and will not be disclosed to any other person without prior consultation with the Discloser, except in limited circumstances defined in the Act and considered below.Civil, criminal, or disciplinary proceedings cannot be taken against a Discloser for making a protected disclosure, or against a receiver who refers one to an appropriate authority, or for referring one to an Appropriate Authority.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Act provides that an employee who is subject to retaliation by their employer for making a protected disclosure can take personal grievance proceedings under the Employment Relations Act 2000.It is unlawful to treat Disclosers, potential Disclosers, those who have encouraged Disclosers, or those who provide information in connection with a protected disclosure, less favourably than others in the same or similar circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0If a Discloser is victimised in this way, the legal remedies under the anti-victimisation protections in the Human Rights Act 1993 may be available to them.\n2. Policy\nAll employees and members of a governing body of the University must facilitate the disclosure and investigation of matters of serious wrongdoing in or by the University.A Discloser may disclose information under these procedures if the following criteria are met: the information is about serious wrongdoing in or by the University and the Discloser believes on reasonable grounds that it is true or likely to be true;the information is disclosed in accordance with the Act and this Policy (which summarises the Act); andthe disclosure is not made in bad faith.Note: A disclosure that meets the above criteria is called a 'Protected Disclosure' under the Act.Any other person who discloses any information in support of, or relating to, a protected disclosure having already been made, is also entitled to protection under the provisions of this Policy and the Act if that Discloser: discloses in accordance with this Policy; anddoes not disclose the information in bad faith.A Discloser is entitled to the protections provided in this Policy and the Act, even if: they are mistaken and there is no serious wrongdoing; orthey do not refer to this Policy or the name of the Act when making the disclosure.Any person who wishes to make a protected disclosure may choose to report the matter anonymously through the independent Whistleblower hotline (0800 100 526).All evidence gathered in relation to a protected disclosure must be fully preserved and protected.The University will not retaliate against any employee for intending to make, or for having to make a protected disclosure.The University will not treat, or threaten to treat a person less favourably than others in similar circumstances for intending to make or having made a protected disclosure, encouraging another person to make a protected disclosure, or for giving information in support of a protected disclosure.Neither a Discloser who makes a protected disclosure, nor a receiver who refers the disclosure, under the Act is liable to any civil, criminal or disciplinary proceeding because of making or referring the disclosure.\n3. Procedure\nMaking a disclosure Where a person to which this Policy relates becomes aware of information about serious wrongdoing, but does not report the matter anonymously through the Whistleblower hotline, they must disclose it without delay to any of the following persons at the University: their managertheir manager\u2019s manager;any senior manager;the Director, Human Resources;the Risk Office;the Registrar; andThe Vice-ChancellorNote: Disclosure will normally be made on a \u2018one-up\u2019 basis i.e. to the immediate line manager of the person making the disclosure, or in appropriate circumstances, to their manager\u2019s line manager.A Discloser or potential Discloser may also approach any of the above-named persons, as well as the Whistleblower hotline, and an Appropriate Authority (including the Ombudsman) for advice, support and practical assistance, as well as to assist in assessing any risks to a Discloser in making a protected disclosure.\u00a0A Discloser may instead make a protected disclosure directly to the Vice-Chancellor if they believe on reasonable grounds that a member of the Senior Leadership Team or a member of the University Council may be involved in the serious wrongdoing or has a relationship or association with an alleged wrongdoer.A Discloser who becomes aware of information about serious wrongdoing may also choose to report it to an Appropriate Authority at any time, including (without limitation) circumstances where: the Discloser is of the view that reporting to an Appropriate Authority is justified due to the urgency of the matter or other exceptional circumstances, orthe Vice-Chancellor may be involved in the alleged serious wrongdoing, orthere has been no action or recommended action on the matter to which the disclosure relates within 20 working days after the date on which the disclosure was made.Please refer to the flowchart set out in Appendix 1 for further information on making a disclosure under the Act and this Policy.Receiving a disclosure If a person receives, or is approached for advice or support about, a protected disclosure and: they are aware that they may have some involvement in the alleged serious wrongdoing, orthey have any relationship or association with an alleged wrongdoer, they must immediately advise the person to contact either the Whistleblower hotline (0800 100 526) or another person listed in clause 3(a)1. above.All protected disclosures which are not made through the Whistleblower hotline must be referred on to the Director, Human Resources immediately by the manager receiving the disclosure.\u00a0The Director, Human Resources may also refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor, in circumstances where the Director, Human Resources considers this is appropriate and following consultation with the applicable Discloser.If the receiver of a protected disclosure considers it appropriate, the receiver can also refer the disclosure to an Appropriate Authority.The applicable manager who has received the disclosure will consult with the Discloser and the intended recipient of a referral, prior to referring the protected disclosure to the intended recipient.\u00a0An intended recipient may include but is not limited to the Director, Human Resources, any other person or an Appropriate Authority.A disclosure may also be referred to an appropriate person within the University as well as to an Appropriate Authority on more than one occasion, provided that the aforementioned requirements are complied with.Confidentiality Any recipient of a protected disclosure, or any person approached for assistance, advice or support in making a protected disclosure, must use their best endeavours not to disclose information that might identify the Discloser who made the protected disclosure unless they have written consent from the Discloser to do so.However, the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor or any investigator appointed by the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor may disclose information that might identify the person who made the protected disclosure if they reasonably believe this is essential: for the effective investigation of the allegations in the protected disclosure, orto prevent serious risk to public health, public safety, the health or safety of any individual, or the environment, orto comply with the principles of natural justice, orif the University is subject to an investigation by a law enforcement or regulatory agency for the purpose of law enforcement.Where such information is to be disclosed for the effective investigation of the allegations in the protected disclosure, or to comply with the principles of natural justice, the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor must consult the Discloser about the intended release.However, where the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor considers it is impracticable in the circumstances to consult with a Discloser due to a serious risk to public health, public safety,\u00a0the health and safety of any individual, or the environment; or to an impending investigation by a law enforcement or regulatory agency for the purposes of law enforcement as outlined in clause 3(c)ii), the requirement to consult prior to the disclosure does not apply.After releasing any identifying information for a reason described in the circumstances above, the receiver must inform the Discloser that their information has been referred and disclosed to another person.Anyone may seek information and guidance from an Ombudsman about this duty of confidentiality.Action following a disclosure After the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor receives a protected disclosure under these procedures, they must give it full consideration and decide with an open mind whether or not the alleged serious wrongdoing should be investigated or whether any further action should be taken.\u00a0The potential outcomes may be: investigating the disclosure;addressing any serious wrongdoing by acting or recommending action;referring the disclosure to an Appropriate Authority;deciding that no action is required.Note: The process of any investigation, and a decision to investigate, will depend on the nature of the alleged wrongdoing.A decision not to investigate alleged serious wrongdoing must be recorded in writing and does not prevent the University from taking further action in relation to matters raised in the protected disclosure, as appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0However, the original Discloser will be consulted on any further action that may be taken, should it require further disclosure to any other person.The Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor may direct another person to make preliminary inquiries or gather evidence on their behalf or perform any other work as necessary to assist them in making their decision.\u00a0\u00a0If the receiver intends to do so, the Discloser will be consulted and notified of any further disclosure.The Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor must also notify the Discloser within 20 working days from the date of the disclosure of their decision whether or not the alleged serious wrongdoing is to be investigated providing reasons for this decision.Where suspected fraudulent activity is identified by the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor this must be reported immediately to the University\u2019s Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance.\u00a0The Discloser will be notified that their protected disclosure will be referred to the University\u2019s Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance prior to this occurring.If the protected disclosure is investigated, a final report detailing the outcome of the investigation and steps taken must be provided to the Director, Human Resources and the Vice-Chancellor, and held as a record by the University's Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance.Note: Further disciplinary or legal action may be taken, as appropriate, in line with the final repor.Further disclosure A Discloser may choose to disclose information about serious wrongdoing to an Appropriate Authority or an Ombudsman if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of any investigation by the University into the serious wrongdoing or any actions taken in respect of such serious wrongdoing.\n Related policies, procedures and forms\nProtected Disclosures ActOfficial Information Act 1982Human Rights Act 1993Privacy Act 1993",

Note: emails, data, datasets, and content created and managed in Microsoft 365 are forms of digital record.All business functions and activities of the University which fall under the coverage of the PRA , including those performed by outside contractors.All corporate applications used to create, manage, and store information, data, and records which fall under the coverage of the PRA , including business information systems, email, websites, databases, and social media applications.All metadata associated with digital information, data, and records which fall under the coverage of the PRA , including data held in business information systems, collaborative workspaces, and content management systems.\nWhile subsidiaries of the University of Otago are separate legal entities, it is acknowledged that the provisions of the Public Records Act 2005 do apply to controlled entities and therefore they may adopt or adapt this policy for their own use.",
        "content": "1. Information and records management lifecycle\nThe University is required to comply with information and records management legislation and regulatory requirements. This includes the obligations set out in the Public Records Act 2005 (PRA) and any associated mandatory standards issued under the Act. The PRA requires that all University business information, records, and data is managed appropriately throughout its lifecycle, until it is archived or destroyed. The records information lifecycle spans from creation to disposal and is illustrated in the below diagram:\nDiagram 1: Information Lifecycle (ARMA International).\n2. Creation and maintenance of information and records\nAll information, data and records must be created in a complete and contextual manner which reliably documents the business activities of the organisation across all physical and digital operating environments.All information, data and records must be maintained appropriately in managed and approved storage solutions that are able to ensure their integrity, usability, and discoverability for their full life cycle.Information and records must not be created and maintained in any personal or private cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Docs, iCloud, or OneDrive.All information, data and records must be managed and protected commensurate with their value and information security classification.Information and records must be considered in all IT-enabled projects and services such as new business information system implementations, or improvements to existing systems, whereby the functionality and system requirements for information and records are defined and designed during the evaluation phase or process.\n3. Accessibility of information and records\nInformation and records must be collected and organised in a way that is easy to find and accessible over time for the purpose of discovery or investigation.Information and records must be secured and protected from corruption, damage, alteration, unauthorised access, use or disclosure, or premature disposal, and in accordance with the University's Cyber Security Framework.Information and records must be available as a corporate resource to all staff, except where the nature of the information requires restriction in accordance with the University's Access Framework for University of Otago Records,\n4. Retention and disposal of information and records\nAll University information, data, and records, including data in business information systems, must be retained for at least the minimum periods set out in the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA).Information and records must be identified so that where practicable retention periods are applied at the time of creation, either using system functionality or as an information management exercise undertaken outside of the system, and records of longer-term value and permanent retention are protected.Information and records must be disposed of in a timely and efficient manner when they are no longer legally or administratively required.Information and records that are of short-term, facilitative, or transitory in value can be disposed of as part of normal administrative practice.Information, data, and records must be retained in the system in which they were created, or reformatted (digitised) and /or migrated to an approved recordkeeping system as appropriate, so that digital or other technology dependent information and records are retained in an authentic and accessible form for as long as is required. Original hard copy information and records that are reformatted (digitised) must meet certain technical and quality assurance requirements before the destruction of the hard copy can take place. Please refer to the University's Digitisation of Records Procedures.Hard copy information and records that have been identified for permanent retention and that are no longer in current use or required administratively by the University must be transferred to the possession of the Hocken Library and the control of the Chief Archivist.\n5. Recordkeeping systems\nThe University uses a variety of IT storage systems and services that create and maintain digital information. How and where digital information is stored will affect their viability over time, and it is important to consider that digital information is likely to have a lifespan beyond the life of the system in which they are born.Not all IT storage systems and services in use at the University will be capable of performing as, or be designated, digital record keeping systems. An appropriate digital record keeping system will be capable of: Sustaining the information for as long as is required to support their legal retention (or capable of exporting the information, together with their relevant metadata, into a new system as and when required to support the required retention)Enabling the destruction of time-expired information in a systematic and auditable way in line with the University's legislative requirementsSupporting the management and monitoring of information and records including maintaining and retaining an auditable record of useAllowing privacy and security requirements for information and records to be managed and enforcedOrganising information appropriately and maintaining accessible and useable metadata to appropriate standardsVendor scrutiny and assessment to ensure widespread industry support and to avoid the system becoming obsolete and unsupportedIT storage systems and services that create and manage digital information but are not deemed capable of performing as, or be designated, a digital record keeping system will at a minimum need to be capable of allowing data migration and / or have the ability to export records and their metadata from one storage solution to another for the purpose of digital archiving.OURDrive, the University's EDRMS, shall be the University's system for managing public records from systems that are not capable of functioning as a digital recordkeeping system.Maintaining original paper source files, or printing and filing records, may be a suitable approach for some types of information. Physical recordkeeping systems will continue to be in operation as a supported record keeping tool until this process is superseded by digital equivalents.\n6. Staff responsibilities\nThe University's Information Framework provides general responsibilities associated with the management of information. Specific responsibilities relating to recordkeeping are as detailed in this section.The University Registrar is the designated Executive Sponsor and has strategic and executive responsibility for overseeing information and records management in the University.The Head of Corporate Records Services is responsible for: Providing advice, guidance, and training to staff on information and records management practices, policies, procedures, and systems.Maintaining communication and awareness with university staff on all matters relating to information and records management and promoting compliance.Leading the development and implementation of strategies and policies to enable sound information and records management practices.Assisting with the development of university recordkeeping and information systems as appropriate.Monitoring information and records management processes, procedures and systems as required, including the retention and disposal of university business information.Advising senior leadership of any risks associated with non-compliance and reporting on records and information management as appropriate.Coordinating the transfer of university information and records of permanent archival value to the Hocken Library and the control of the Chief Archivist.The Corporate Records Services team are responsible for providing business support for, and liaising with staff on, the promotion and implementation of information and records management best practice.

        "content": "Some commercially sensitive sections of this Policy have been redacted.Ask a question about this Policy\nTreasury management responsibilitiesThe University Council has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that there is an effective framework for the recognition, management and reporting of treasury risks. This includes: deciding the level and nature of treasury risks that are acceptable, given the underlying objectives of the University of Otago and the Council's financial responsibilities and Section 281(1)(e) of the Education and Training Act 2020, andapproving the Treasury Management Policy, including any substantive amendments to the policy.The Vice-Chancellor has overall responsibility for treasury management through delegation from the Council. This includes approving authorised signatories and delegated authorities in respect of treasury dealing and banking activities (consistent with financial delegations approved by the Council where relevant \u2013 see clause 2(b) below).The Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) is responsible for the management of treasury activities through delegation from the Vice-Chancellor. This includes: in conjunction with the Vice-Chancellor, developing the annual financial budget and long-term financial strategy/plansreporting to the Council's Finance and Budget Committee on treasury matters, and advising the Vice-Chancellor and Finance and Budget Committee of significant treasury eventsrecommending to the Vice-Chancellor authorised signatories and delegated authorities in respect of all treasury dealing and banking activitieshaving primary responsibility for managing bank relationshipsnegotiating bank funding and financial market dealing facilities in accordance with this policyrecommending changes to this policy to the Finance and Budget Committee, including advising on borrowing, treasury investment and risk management provisions, following consultation with the Vice-Chancellor, andmonitoring and reviewing the performance of the treasury function in terms of achieving its objectives.The Finance and Budget Committee has responsibilities as outlined in its Terms of Reference as listed on the Finance and Budget Committee webpage. Finance and Budget CommitteeDelegation of authority and authority limitsOverarching delegated authority and authority limits are set out in the Council Delegations Schedule. Council Delegations Schedule (PDF)Treasury management duties and responsibilities outlined in this policy are reinforced through the delegated authorities listed in the Schedule of Financial Delegations. Schedule of Financial DelegationsAll delegated authorities and signatories will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that they are still appropriate and current.Whenever a person with delegated authority on any account or facility leaves the University, all relevant banks and other counterparties will be advised in writing in a timely manner to ensure that no unauthorised instructions are accepted from such persons.Annually, banks will be provided with a list of personnel with the delegated authority to undertake transactions, standard settlement instructions and details of personnel able to receive confirmations.University borrowingThe objective of the University's borrowing management is to provide on-going liquidity and funding support to enable the University to achieve its strategy. In the management of its borrowing, the University is required to manage costs and risks and to comply with financial ratios and limits on a current and prospective basis.The Council retains authority to review and approve all new loans and borrowing facilities, including the refinancing of existing lending facilities.Under section 282(4)(d) of the Education and Training Act 2020 the University is required to obtain written approval from the Secretary of the Ministry of Education to borrow funds. Therefore, any future borrowing requirements must be identified well in advance of the date they will be required to allow for the approval process. Education and Training Act 2020 \u2013 297. Bank accountsThe University will prepare regular financial reports and medium to long-term rolling cash flow and debt forecasts which enable it to identify its borrowing requirements.[REDACTED]Finance leases are tools that allow the University to accumulate debt-like obligations with an embedded interest cost. Alternatively, the University may be able to obtain a cheaper source of funds through its banking relationships. All proposed finance lease arrangements must include a 'lease or buy' assessment prior to any contract being approved.As a form of borrowing, finance leases must be within the Ministerial determination of 2014 and approved by the Council or, if outside the University's approved borrowing consent, require the approval of the Secretary for Education through the TEC . For further information and the full requirements refer to Finance lease information on the TEC website. How TEIs can enter into a finance lease \u2013 Tertiary Education CommissionOnce borrowing is in place, renegotiations of any new debt or facility should commence 12 months prior to the maturity date of the existing facility. New facilities should be executed at least one month prior to expiry of the existing. This renegotiation will follow the University's procurement policies and procedures, with reference to the terms of the relevant consents received from the Secretary for Education.Where TEC and bank financial covenants are in place and require ongoing compliance, covenant risk is mitigated through ongoing monitoring and regular reporting to the Finance and Budget Committee and Council (see also clause 12 of this Policy).The University does not offer security on its borrowing and derivative activity.Investment managementThe University's investment management aims to protect the value of the investment, provide liquidity and within this optimise the investment return of working capital for an agreed level of risk. Investments must be made in accordance with legislative requirements including Crown Entities Act 2004 and Education and Training Act 2020. For completeness, the provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004 which apply to the University are listed in schedule 4, part 1. Crown Entities Act 2004 \u2013 158. Bank accounts of Crown entitiesEducation and Training Act 2020 \u2013 297. Bank accountsAccurate cash flow forecasts will be maintained to ensure sufficient levels of liquidity to meet both planned and unforeseen cash requirements, and to assist borrowing decisions.The University has a commitment to ethical and socially responsible investing. Therefore, any equity and bond investment made must consider social good as well as financial return. The University should not invest directly in companies that are primarily involved in the production or distribution of alcohol, tobacco or munitions, or in the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. A measured approach should be taken with materiality issues considered.Investments permitted by legislation The Public Finance Act 1989 (section 65I \u2013 Investment of public money) requires that the University, as a Crown Entity, invests funds in accordance with the rules applying to the University's investment of public money. This allows Crown Entities to invest in bank deposits (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) approved by the Minister of Finance for the purpose; or in public securities or other securities that the Minister may approve for the purpose. The Minister can grant exemptions to these criteria (see 4(e) below).Investments permitted by exemption to legislation Subsequent to an exemption granted by the Minister of Finance, on 2 May 2011, to the University under section 65I of the Public Finance Act 1989 and section 203(4) of the Education Act 1989, investments can be made by the University in debt or equity securities in companies, in New Zealand or overseas, that are developing and commercialising intellectual property created by or on behalf of the University. This is subject to the following: The aggregate face value of all these investments (either in cash or cash equivalent) shall not exceed 2 per cent of the equity of the University group, measured against the most recent audited group financial statement for the University.There must be no contingent liabilities associated with any investment by the University, either by way of uncalled shares, guarantees or otherwise.Investments made by the University under this exemption must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor up to the limit of the Vice-Chancellor's delegated financial authority for capital expenditure and by the Council for amounts above this.Investments permitted as not covered by legislation The Office of the Auditor General, Treasury and the TEC have agreed that equity holdings or loans in companies involved primarily in providing teaching and research-related activities are not \u201cinvestments\u201d under the Public Finance Act 1989. The University shall rely on this arrangement to make such investments. Investments made by the University under this arrangement require approval by the Vice-Chancellor up to the limit of the Vice-Chancellor's delegated financial authority for capital expenditure, and by the Council for amounts above this.Investments in companies Equity investments and loans to companies that are not subsidiaries of the University must only be made if they comply with the conditions and approvals outlined in clauses 4(e) or 4(f) above.Investments in bank term deposits Bank term deposits are subject to relevant provisions in this this policy, including credit risk management (see clause 6 below) and requirements around banks approved under the Public Finance Act 1989 (as per clause 4(d)). The following additional provisions also apply: A new bank account may only be opened, and an existing bank account may only be closed, with the approval of both the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice-Chancellor.Investments of University working capital in bank call and term deposits beyond six months must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. If the Chief Financial Officer is not available then this may be approved by either the Vice-Chancellor or in their absence, a Deputy Vice-Chancellor.Investments held in working capital should be managed so that the balance held matches future expected outgoings as far as practicable with surplus funds being invested in call or term deposits.Investment instructions provided to the banks must follow the format on the Term Deposit Instructions Form. Investments are approved by two authorised signatories. Term Deposit Instructions Form (PDF)Term deposit rates should be sought from the registered banks meeting the ratings set out in clause 6(b) of this policy, and the best rate should be accepted for the University within the framework for investment in bank deposits set out in clause 6 of this policy.To ensure appropriate separation of duties, staff members placing funds on deposit should not be responsible for reconciliations of bank funds on hand.Transactional banking managementThe treasury function requires a centralised management of transactional banking and risk management. Transactional banking must be provided by an institution which complies with the terms of the Crown Entities Act 2004. Bank account operation and reconciliation requirements are detailed in the Bank Accounts Procedure. Crown Entities Act 2004 \u2013 158. Bank accounts of Crown entitiesBank Accounts ProcedureCounterparty credit risk managementThe primary objective of managing credit risk is to ensure that the University does not suffer losses due to counterparty failure that significantly impacts the financial performance of the University.The University will manage its credit exposure to its liquidity, treasury investment and derivatives activity by only transacting with approved bank counterparties. Unless otherwise approved by Council, counterparties will be New Zealand registered banks with a credit rating at least equivalent to one of: Standard & Poor's (\u201cS&P\u201d) AFitch AMoody's A2The below limits are relevant for all treasury investment, interest rate risk and foreign currency management activity: Counterparty/IssuerMinimum S&P (or equivalent) long term/short term credit ratingTotal derivative limit per counterparty ($million)Total investment limit per counterparty ($million)Total maximum combined limit per counterparty ($million)NZ GovernmentAA+UnlimitedUnlimitedUnlimitedNZ Registered Bank (per bank)AA/AA-25.02550NZ Registered Bank (per bank)A15.01530In determining the usage of the gross limits under clause 4(c) above, the following weightings will be used: Treasury investments (e.g. bank term deposits and call account balances) = Transaction principal amount.Interest rate risk management (e.g. swaps, Forward Rate Agreements ( FRA s) = Transaction Notional x Maturity (years) x 3%.Foreign Exchange Risk (e.g. Forward Exchange Contract) = Transaction Face Value amount x ((square root of the maturity (years)) x 15%).Counterparties exceeding the gross limits in clause 6(c) will be reported to Council (normally through Finance and Budget Committee), along with a recommended strategy to move back into policy compliance.Foreign exchange risk managementThe primary objective of managing foreign exchange risk is to mitigate against the adverse impact on New Zealand dollar ($NZ) expenses and purchases from foreign exchange rate movement.The University will hold foreign currency received from goods and services sold in a foreign currency in a denominated New Zealand bank account (the 'foreign currency account') up to an amount that covers: all forecast and known purchases of goods and services in the calendar year that the foreign currency is received, andany known, foreign currency liabilities and purchases that are unavoidable and will be paid anytime in the twelve month period following the receipt of the foreign currency (the natural hedge).The funds held in the foreign currency account may be sold where the University has a demand for cash.The University will sell forward all sales of goods or services denominated in foreign currency and not required for the natural hedge immediately when the sale becomes an unavoidable asset to the University.The University will purchase forward cover for all individual purchases of goods or services denominated in foreign currency and not covered by the natural hedge immediately when the purchase becomes an unavoidable liability or purchase to the University and exceeds\u00a0$100,000NZD in value. Purchases under $100,000NZD may be hedged at the discretion of the contract authorisers.The University will purchase forward cover for all liabilities denominated in foreign currency and not covered by the natural hedge immediately when the liability becomes an unavoidable liability to the University.For the purposes of clauses 7(e) and (f), any purchase or liability which is: included in the budget approved by University Council, oris recurring in nature and has been included in the budget approved by Council in each of the last five years, and is included in the budget that has been approved by the Vice-Chancellor but has not yet been approved by Councilwill be considered to be an unavoidable liability.When the settlement dates for foreign exchange purchase agreements are not able to be met, and the unavoidable liability still exists, the University will purchase the contracted currency and deposit those funds into its foreign currency account to be used when the liability falls due.The following approved foreign currency instruments will be used to manage purchase amounts in excess of goods and services sold: foreign currency deposit account amountsspot foreign exchange contractsforward foreign exchange contractsforeign currency swaps.With respect to Foreign Exchange Contracts: The value of foreign exchange contracts in place will not exceed the value of funds to be paid or received.Approved individual purchase orders for purchases in foreign currencies over $100,000NZD should be hedged where practicable. The approved purchase order, currency type, amount and estimate of the date of payment should be provided to the Treasury Asset and Insurance Accountant, Financial Services Division as soon as the purchase order has been approved. The Treasury Asset and Insurance Accountant will purchase a hedging contract with the bank and forward the details back to the relevant Department. This is the price the Department will be charged for the purchase of the goods.For regular annual expenditure items, such as library book purchases, membership fees and standard consulting fees, where the total of forecasted purchases is over $100,000NZD in any one currency, the contracts will be purchased by the Treasury Asset and Insurance Accountant when the budget is approved and as soon as market conditions become favourable.When the forecast dates for external foreign exchange settlements are not able to be met, the University will still purchase the contracted currency and will place the funds purchased in a foreign exchange bank account until the purchase is able to be made. Any interest gained on holding these foreign balances will not be available to Departments.For the avoidance of doubt, transactions of a speculative nature where there is not a legitimate underlying business cash flow being managed are not permitted.Funding risk managementThe primary focus of funding risk management is to ensure that debt facilities and drawdowns under those facilities can be rolled over and renewed in a timely manner and at a fair price.As far as is practical, the University will stagger the maturity dates of bank facilities in order to mitigate the risk of raising new or re-financing existing debt facilities thereby reducing exposure to adverse circumstances which may impact the availability or price of such funding. See also clause 3(h) on renegotiation.When actual debt amounts are at $20 million or above it is mandatory that the following limits apply for managing funding risk. The maturity profile of the total committed funding in respect to all core debt and committed debt facilities is to be managed within the below limits: PeriodMinimum %Maximum %0 to 3 years25753 years plus2575A funding maturity profile that is outside the above limits, but self corrects within 90-days is not in breach of this Policy. However, maintaining a maturity profile outside of policy limits beyond 90-days requires specific approval of Council.Approved working capital and debt facilities include bank overdraft and committed bank debt funding facilities.Interest rate risk managementThe primary objective of managing interest rate risk is to mitigate the negative impact of adverse changes in interest rates on the University's budgeted interest revenue and interest expense amounts.When actual core debt amounts are at $20 million or above it is mandatory that the interest rate exposures are managed according to the limits detailed in the following table. The University's forecast gross debt amounts must be within the following interest fixed/floating rate limits: Debt interest rate policy parameters (calculated on rolling monthly basis)Debt period endingMinimum fixed rateMaximum fixed rateCurrent40%90%Year 140%90%Year 235%85%Year 330%80%Year 425%75%Year 520%70%Year 60%65%Year 70%60%Year 80%55%Year 90%50%Year 100%45%A fixed rate maturity profile that is outside the above limits, but self corrects within 90-days is not in breach of this Policy. However, maintaining a maturity profile that is outside the above limits beyond 90-days requires specific approval by Council.Interest rate hedging activity with a maturity of fewer than or equal to five years with a value of $0 to $10m and within the risk parameters in clauses 6(b) of this policy must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor or any two Authorised Signatories.Interest rate hedging activity with a maturity of greater than five years, or over $10m and within the risk parameters in clauses 6(b) of this policy must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor or any two Authorised Signatories, one of whom must be either the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Operating Officer.Any hedging with a maturity beyond five years or which is outside the risk parameters in 6(b) shall require Council approval.Approved interest rate instruments that may be used in managing interest risk are the following interest rate swaps: forward start swapsswap shortening and extensions (must be approved by two Authorised Signatories, one of whom must be either the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Operating Officer) andinterest rate options on: Bank bills (purchased caps and one for one collars)Interest rate swaptions (purchased only)The forward start period on swaps and collars must be no more than 36 months from the deal date, except where the forward start swap/collar starts on the expiry date of an existing swap/collar and has a notional amount which is no more than that of the existing swap/collar.Any other interest rate instrument not listed in clause 6(f) must be specifically approved by Council. Such approval shall be on a case-by-case basis and may only be applied to the one singular transaction being approved.Credit exposure on these interest rate instruments is restricted by specified counterparty credit limits.For the avoidance of doubt, transactions of a speculative nature where there is not a legitimate underlying business cash flow being managed are not permitted.Liquidity risk managementThe primary objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet the University's financial commitments when required. Management must include allowance for unforeseen events which may curtail cash flows and cause pressure on liquid assets. The possible causes of a crisis in liquidity include: unexpected reduction in revenuesunexpected increase in operating expensesunexpected capital expenditurebusiness disruption[REDACTED]Committed bank facilities are only executed with those banks that have a long-term credit rating of at least A by S&P (or equivalent Moody's or Fitch) ratings.Operational risk managementThe University will have controls in place to minimise operational risks arising from human error, fraud, systems failures or inadequate procedures and controls. These will include: dealing authorities and limits \u2013 transactions will only be executed by those persons and within limits approved under formal delegation by University Council or the Vice-Chancellorsegregation of duties \u2013 no single person shall be permitted to deal/transact, authorise and confirm a treasury transactionregular management reportingregular risk assessment, including review of procedures and controls as directed by the Finance and Budget Committee, andOrganisational, systems, procedural and reconciliation controls to ensure: all cash management, borrowing, treasury investment and risk management activity is bona fide and properly authorisedchecks are in place to ensure accounts and records are updated promptly, accurately and completelyrisk positions are updated, reviewed and reported on a regular basisthe matching of third-party confirmations with immediate follow-up of anomalies, andany unresolved discrepancies are to be immediately advised to the Chief Financial Officer who will determine and/or approve any consequent action to remedy the discrepancy.The University will minimise legal risks (e.g. the unenforceability of a transaction due to an organisation not having the legal capacity or power to enter into the transaction or deficiencies in documentation) by ensuring all transactions are permissible under legislation and all significant legal documentation is reviewed and endorsed by legal counsel.Where the University uses derivative instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to fluctuations in financial market pricing, the accounting treatment for such instruments will follow PBE accounting standards or the equivalent for the public sector.Treasury reporting and performance managementIn order to determine the effectiveness and success of the University's treasury management function, compliance and performance benchmark measures will be reported by the Chief Financial Officer to the Vice-Chancellor, Finance and Budget Committee and University Council. These shall include: A monthly Treasury Dashboard Report, comprising: Asset management Income, expenditure and funds availableLiquidity risk position including availabilityRisk management Borrowing and interest rate risk positionTreasury investment maturity risk positionCredit and counterparty riskForeign currency riskFinancial covenants and TEC limit reportingMarket commentary and strategy updatePerformance benchmarkingExceptions ReportDerivative valuationsCash and borrowing forecast.A biannual Foreign Exchange Report, including details of: foreign currency cash holdingsforeign exchange risk positions and contracts, andpolicy compliance.A report to each ordinary Finance and Budget Committee meeting on the University's investment portfolio in terms of compliance with this policy.The Chief Financial Officer shall receive and monitor a weekly cash forecast report.Responding to extraordinary eventsWhere internal or external issues are identified outside of the normal budget cycle which have a capacity to materially impact the University's financial sustainability, the Finance and Budget Committee may revisit strategies in this policy and make recommendations to the Council to facilitate alignment and achievement of the University's operational and strategic plans.Policy reviewThis Treasury Management Policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis. This shall include a check for currency and fitness-for-purpose every year, with a more in-depth fundamental review completed every second year.The Chief Financial Officer has the responsibility for preparing a review report that is presented to the Vice-Chancellor and Finance and Budget Committee. The report may include: recommendation as to changes, deletions and additions to the policyoverview of the treasury management function in achieving the stated objectives, including a summary of breaches and one-off approvals to highlight areas of tensionanalysis of bank and lender service provision, and share of financial instrument transactionscomments and recommendations from the internal/external auditors on the treasury function, particularly internal controls, accounting treatments and reportingreview of the treasury spreadsheets/monitoring tools and procedures, andan assessment on the performance of any specialist external support.Amendments to the Policy require Council approval taking into account advice from the Finance and Budget Committee.\n",

        "content": "1. General Principles\nA Staff Critical Incident is a traumatic event which causes serious distress or harm to a staff member or members at the University, whether: directly as being the immediate victim(s) of a traumatic event, medical event or event impacting a student or student group (e.g. staff or student death or serious injury),indirectly, through staff being affected by, but not directly involved in, a traumatic event (e.g. natural disasters, death of a staff member, threat to staff or students).Where a traumatic event occurs which has impacted on staff, or has the potential to impact upon staff, a determination shall be made as to whether the event is a Staff Critical Incident requiring the response of the team based on: whether any staff members are directly involved in the traumatic event and to what degree \u2013 whether the event has occurred in the context of the University (i.e. in relation to the operations of the University or activities associated with the University such as field trips or events)Status of Permit to Workthe number of staff indirectly affected by the eventthe extent of potential distress for staff indirectly affected by the event, andthe extent of the potential impact on the students and/or staff in the area.The death of a current staff member whether due to a medical event or the serious injury of a staff member in a University context, shall be considered a Staff Critical Incident.The University shall seek to respond to a Staff Critical Incident in a coordinated and appropriate manner, taking into account the nature of the incident and the needs of the staff, students, their families, and the University. It is acknowledged that the level of University involvement may vary depending on the circumstances of the incident in question.Staff Critical Incidents will be managed by the chair of the Staff Critical Incident Response team, who shall convene the Team as required.Staff may consult with the Chair on any matter arising from a Staff Critical Incident, and must refer any request to disclose personal information to the Chair.If Worksafe NZ or the Police are involved as part of the incident, injury, death or event, the contact person is the Chair.\u00a0\u00a0In consultation with the Staff Critical Incident Team and/or other staff as relevant, the chair will advise on an appropriate course of action taking into account the principles stated in clauses 1(c) and 1(g).A significant event on campus may lead the Vice-Chancellor to declare a 'State of Campus Emergency', which invokes the University's Emergency Management Plan. In such cases the provisions of the Emergency Management Plan shall take precedence over the provisions in this Policy; however, the Staff Critical Incident and Student Critical Incident provisions may still be applied as appropriate.Staff information will be disclosed only in accordance with the Privacy Act 2020, the Health Information Privacy Code and the Privacy Policy.Members of the Staff Critical Incident Response team shall receive appropriate training to manage and respond to incidents.The Staff Critical Incident Response Team shall normally comprise: The Director, Human Resources (Chair)The Divisional HR Manager for the relevant department/divisionThe PVC/Dean/Manager/Director/Head of College as appropriate (lead staff member[s])A member of the occupational health teamthe Head of Communicationsthe Proctor, if applicable.Other relevant staff may be co-opted onto the Team as required based on the specific circumstances of any particular Staff Critical Incident, such as: the nature of the Staff Critical Incident (senior management representation may be appropriate for very significant and/or wide-reaching incidents)the impacted student and staff groupsthe relationship of the staff member to impacted groups they may be working with, and/orany distress a potential Lead Staff Member may be experiencing as a result of the incident which may impact on their ability to act in this role.\n2. Notification of a Staff Critical Incident to the University\nPotential critical incidents should be reported to the Director, Human Resources, who shall verify that the event in question has taken place (with input from the Proctor if required). If the event is considered a significant event which must be reported to Worksafe NZ , Maritime NZ or Public Health South, the Chair shall ensure the notifications are made by the relevant party.On determining that an event is to be considered a Staff Critical Incident, the Chair shall: contact relevant staff and authorities to advise them of the incident, including the members of the Staff Critical Incident Response Team and other key staff as appropriate to the incident and staff in question,convene the Staff Critical Incident Response Team, andfollowing any appropriate consultation, contact and enlist further Lead Staff Member(s) as required.All stages of notification of a Staff Critical Incident shall be carried out in a timely fashion with respect to the specific circumstances of the incident in question; in some cases this will mean communications should be carried out with urgency.\n3. University Response to a Staff Critical Incident\nThe Chair and/or the Staff Critical Incident Response Team shall decide on, coordinate and direct the response to a Staff Critical Incident.Response activities will vary depending on the nature of the Critical Incident, but may include: communication with the wider University community (staff and/or students) on the incidentan appropriate Lead Staff Member meeting or otherwise communicating with the staff member and/or their familyappropriate Lead Staff Member(s) meeting or otherwise communicating with relevant staff to ensure they are supported in case of a critical incident and are aware of the support they can offer to affected partiesan appropriate Lead Staff Member meeting or otherwise communicating with those closest to an injured or deceased staff, such as colleagues, students and/or family, and/orthe planning of acknowledgement activities (e.g. the sending of flowers, memorials).Communications with affected groups may include, as appropriate: factual information about the Staff Critical Incident including update information to staff and students where a Staff Critical Incident is ongoing (care should be taken to ensure the veracity of any information communicated and that the privacy of those involved is not breached)information on support services available to staff and studentsadvice to staff and students on the appropriate use of social media to prevent increased distress to the friends and family of an injured or deceased staff member, and/or the spread of rumours,the conveying of condolences and sympathy to affected parties, and/orinformation on and/or invitation to participate in planned acknowledgement activities.Staff are encouraged to be available to staff and students who may be distressed following a Staff Critical Incident, subject to staff managing their own emotional wellbeing. However, staff should also be aware of professional support services available for staff.It may be appropriate to complete additional tasks some weeks or months after a Staff Critical Incident, for example a memorial service as per the University's Campus Memorial Policy.A review shall be carried out by the Chair, with involved staff, following all Staff Critical Incidents which require the convening of the Staff Critical Incident Response Team. Any issues identified or recommendations for improvements shall be noted.\n4. Sources of Support\nThe Chaplains can assist with pastoral and spiritual support, with the arrangement of memorial services, and with the provision of resources on death and grieving.The Occupational Health TeamThe Employee Assistance Programme can provide counselling support for staff following a Staff Critical Incident.The Office of M\u0101ori Development is available to advise and assist with a blessing if appropriate.\n5. Persons Responsible\nThe Director, Human Resources is responsible for: in consultation with the relevant Department, the Proctor, and Health, Safety and Wellbeing, determining if an event is to be considered a Staff Critical Incident on all University of Otago campusesmaintaining a Staff Critical Incident Contact List of University staff to be advised in the event of a Staff Critical Incidentensuring that relevant parties are made aware of a Staff Critical Incident in a timely fashion, subject to privacy and confidentiality restrictions, andthe overall management and coordination of activities related to a Staff Critical Incident, including the appointment of a deputy Chair, Staff Critical Incident Response Team.The Staff Critical Incident Response Team, which may meet or otherwise liaise at the request of the chair, is responsible for assisting the relevant parties in the planning and carrying out of tasks required in relation to a Staff Critical Incident.The Director of Communications is responsible for co-ordinating external communications with the media for Staff Critical Incidents on all campuses, and supporting departments as requested to deal with media communications and requests.",

Notification and Disclosure\nTo facilitate the creation and protection of commercially valuable Intellectual Property, a staff member should immediately advise the Director, Research and Enterprise when research activity generates results that are novel and have potential commercial applicability. The Director, Research and Enterprise will make the final decision on commercial applicability, and, where appropriate, will initiate formal procedures to protect Intellectual Property. Any costs involved will be paid by the University but may be recovered subsequently pursuant to clause 5 below.In order to safeguard any Intellectual Property arising from research activity within the University, staff members must not disclose the results of research activity with potential commercial applicability to anybody outside the University until the Director, Research and Enterprise has made a final decision on commercial applicability and protection of any Intellectual Property that may arise from that activity. This decision shall be made expeditiously, so that publication of staff members' work is not unreasonably delayed.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0General principle\nExcept as otherwise specified in this Policy or agreed in writing: subject to clause 3 below, the University claims ownership of all Intellectual Property in or to any works, materials, inventions or research activity produced or created by University staff in the course of their employment with the University, andUniversity staff may not use, disclose or commercially exploit any works, materials, inventions or research results in which the University owns any Intellectual Property, except as directed or permitted to do so by the University.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0Copyright\nThe University does not claim copyright in work or material produced by University staff in furtherance of their general employment obligations to teach and to undertake scholarly research, and agrees that copyright in such work or material is owned by the University staff members who produce it. For the avoidance of doubt, clause 2(a)ii still applies where such work or material incorporates or discloses any inventions or research results in which the University owns any Intellectual Property.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Copyright licence and restriction on use of copyright materials\nWhere University staff, in the course of their employment, produce teaching materials or resources for distribution or display to students, or for use in University research: the copyright owner shall not, while employed by the University, assign or license the copyright in such materials or resources with potential commercial applicability to any other institution providing educational or research services without the consent of the University, andthe University is entitled to a non-exclusive, non-assignable, royalty-free, irrevocable and perpetual licence from the copyright owner to copy, reproduce and distribute the materials or resources for use within the University for teaching and research purposes, andthe University is entitled to a non-exclusive, irrevocable and perpetual licence from the copyright owner to copy, reproduce and distribute the materials or resources when incorporated into computer software (\u201cCourseware\u201d).

As a first charge the University shall recover all direct expenses incurred in the protection and/or commercialisation of the Intellectual Property.As a second charge the relevant cost centre of the University shall recover time-based fees related to the protection and/or commercialisation of the Intellectual Property. The hourly rate for these fees shall be no greater than the hourly rate charged in the Service Level Agreement then current between the Director, Research and Enterprise and University departments.The balance of the royalties or other remuneration shall then be divided as follows: one third to the University staff member(s) who produced the works, materials, inventions or research results in which the Intellectual Property subsistsone third to the University department where the works, materials, inventions or research results in which the Intellectual Property subsists were producedone third to the University.The University department referred to in clause 5(a)(iii) shall reserve one half of the funds it receives to support further research projects within the University of the staff members referred to in clause 5(a)(iii). These funds shall be available for two years, and if not used by that time will become general funds of the University department.If anyone entitled to payments pursuant to this clause acts to hinder the University in the exercise of its Intellectual Property rights, the University may cease the payments.\n6. External Research Contracts\nThe University may enter into contracts to provide research resources to external clients, including those in the commercial sector. Ownership of the Intellectual Property arising from such research, and distribution of income from that Intellectual Property will be governed by the terms of the contracts, and clauses 2, 3 and 5 above will not apply.University staff members engaged in such contract research must comply with all contract terms and conditions, including any confidentiality requirements and publication constraints.",

The Intellectual Property Rights Policy states that it applies to all University staff who conduct research. However, the External Research Contracts policy deals with external research contracts, which may not necessarily involve university staff conducting research within the university. This inconsistency could lead to confusion about the applicability of each policy.\n\n3. **Lack of clear procedures**: Although the policies provide detailed guidelines and instructions on how to handle various situations related to intellectual property rights, they do not contain explicit procedures for specific scenarios. For example, there are no clear instructions on how to disclose research results or how to handle conflicts of interest. \n\n4. **Overlapping content**: Some sections of the Intellectual Property Rights Policy overlap with other policies, such as the copyright policy (Clause 3). It would be better to consolidate these sections into a single policy document to avoid redundancy and improve clarity.\n\n5. **Unclear distribution of income from intellectual property**: Clause 5 of the Intellectual Property Rights Policy outlines how royalties or remuneration received by the University should be distributed. However, this section appears to be unclear, as it does not specify who is responsible for tracking and distributing these funds.\n\n6. **No clear process for appeals or grievances**: There are no explicit procedures for appealing or addressing grievances related to intellectual property rights within the policies. It would be beneficial to include a clear process for handling disputes or concerns related to intellectual property rights.\n\n7. **Redundant language**: Some sections of the policies contain redundant language, which could be condensed or removed to improve clarity and readability. For example, Clause 4 (Copyright Licence and Restriction on Use of Copyright Materials) states that \"the University is entitled to a non-exclusive, non-assignable, royalty-free, irrevocable and perpetual licence from the copyright owner\" multiple times.\n\nThese are some potential areas for improvement in the policies.

However, this information is also implied in Section 3 (\"Laboratory Audit and Incident Investigation\") as part of the regular auditing and investigation procedures.\n2. **Ambiguous manual reference**: The policy mentions \"the manual\" (University of Otago HSNO Exempt Laboratory Manual) but does not explicitly state that this manual is separate from the policy itself. It would be helpful to clarify this relationship or provide a clear reference to an external document.\n3. **Procedure-like section without clarity**: Section 3 (\"Laboratory Audit and Incident Investigation\") outlines specific steps for auditing laboratory-related incidents, which could be considered a procedure. However, it is not explicitly marked as a procedure, and its purpose is not clearly stated. It would be beneficial to have a clear indication that this section is intended as a procedure or provide more context about its purpose.\n4. **Lack of clear separation between policy and procedures**: The policy data does not clearly separate policy statements from procedural instructions. While some sections (e.g., Section 3) resemble procedures, others (e.g., the first two sections) appear to be more policy-oriented. A clearer distinction between policy and procedure could improve the organization and clarity of the policy.\n5. **Potential overlap with other policies**: The \"HSNO_Exempt_Laboratory_Compliance_Policy\" seems to cover a broad range of topics related to laboratory compliance. However, it is unclear whether this policy might overlap with or be superseded by other university policies, such as those related to budgeting, auditing, or incident investigation. A review of these potential overlaps could help refine the policy or identify areas where it can be consolidated or updated.\n6. **Consideration of standardization**: The policy mentions \"any referenced standards\" but does not specify which standards are being referred to. Standardizing references to external documents or guidelines could improve the clarity and consistency of the policy.\n\nOverall, while the provided policy data appears well-structured and coherent, there are some inconsistencies and areas for improvement in terms of clarity and organization. Addressing these suggestions could help refine the policy and make it more effective in achieving its intended goals."

        "content": "General PrinciplesThe University acknowledges that, from time to time, an additional monetary payment in the form of a bonus may need to be made to a staff member to recognise and reward the achievement of a certain specific task or set of tasks.The University believes that the investment in a bonus payment should occur as soon as possible after the achievement of the particular task or set of tasks for which a bonus payment is to be made.Recommendations and approvals of bonus payments will not form part of the Performance and Development ReviewThe University believes that the approval of a recommendation for a bonus payment should be devolved in terms of a sensible delegation of authority code.PolicyThere may be circumstances where a staff member has undertaken substantial additional work or special projects over and above normal duties, which warrant recognition. In such a case, the granting of a one-off bonus payment may be appropriate.A bonus payment should not be made for work which has already been rewarded in other ways. For example, a bonus should not be paid for work which has already been recognised through payment of a Higher Duties Allowance or by way of salary movement following the Performance and Development Review. A bonus must not be used in place of a higher duties allowance or overtime payment in circumstances where the staff member is entitled to such a payment under their employment contract.A recommendation for a bonus payment to a staff member: should be made by the staff member's immediate supervisor, or the staff member through his/her immediate supervisor, to the Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head (see item 2.f below) through: the Manager or Head of Department and/or Head of Cost Centre; Dean (if applicable); and Divisional Head;should be made on the prescribed BPR form;should be accompanied by a full justification in accordance with the policy and procedures set out in this document;may be made at any time during the year;should preferably be initiated immediately following the achievement of the specific task (or set of tasks) for which a bonus is being recommended, but no later than twelve months after the task/s have been achieved; andshould not normally be made more than once in every 12 months to the same staff member.The Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head, as the case may be, reserves the right to amend/request further justification/approve/not approve a recommendation for a bonus payment.Bonus payments should be in multiples of $100 with a minimum of $200 and, as a general guide, should not normally exceed 2 percent of a staff member's annual salary. When deciding on the amount to recommend for a bonus payment, the nature of the work performed should be taken into consideration. Unless it is clearly stated that the bonus payment is to be pro-rated for part-time staff, the payment will not be pro-rated.The following delegation of authority for the approval of bonus payments will apply: Divisional Heads - up to and including $1,500Vice-Chancellor - exceeding $1,500Any members of the General Staff, irrespective of length of service, are eligible to be recommended for a bonus payment.ProcedureImmediate supervisor or staff member completes Form BPR appropriately.A full justification for the recommendation is required on Form BPR .The Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head, as the case may be, considers the recommendation and either: Amends or requests further details orApproves or does not approve the bonus paymentOnce approval has been obtained, the Divisional Head: writes to the staff member concerned informing him/her about the payment and the reasons for it; andsubmits to Payroll Input, Human Resources the following:the original, authorised Form BPR anda copy of the letter written to the staff memberOnce the Payroll Input team within Human Resources receives Form BPR with the letter to the staff member, they will process for payment. The Form and letter will then be filed on the staff member's personal file.Where a staff member has personally applied for a bonus payment to be made (as in paragraph 2(c)(i) under \"Policy\" above), and the payment has been declined or has been reduced by a Divisional Head, the staff member may submit a request for review to the Director, Human Resources for consideration by the Vice-Chancellor.

However, the University must assign unique identifiers in accordance with the following requirements: The University must take reasonable steps to ensure that unique identifiers are assigned only to an individual whose identity is clearly established, and that the risk of misuse of a unique identifier by any person is minimised.The University must protect its unique identifiers from misuse (such as by masking or truncating them in correspondence).Student and employee ID cards will be allocated in conjunction with appropriate personal information, as governed by the Identity Card Sector Allocation Policy and Identity Card Issuing Policy.\nTransparency\nSubject to clause 1(h), at the time that personal information is being collected from a data subject, the University Community must ensure that data subjects are made aware: what information is being collectedwhy the information is being collectedhow the information will be usedwho the information will be shared withif the collection of the information is authorised or required by or under law, the particular law by or under which the collection of the information is authorised or required and whether the supply of the information by the individual is voluntary or mandatorythe consequences (if any) for that individual if all or any part of the requested information is not provided, andwhat rights they have in relation to their information.If the information collected is a routine part of University process (that is, the collection of information is not unusual or ad hoc), it will be sufficient for compliance with clause 1(f) above if the University Community refers to, or provides the data subject with a link to, the relevant privacy statement.Unless the data collection relates to data subjects located in the EU or China, it is not necessary to comply with 1(f) if an individual with appropriate authority believes on reasonable grounds that: Non-compliance would not prejudice the interests of the individual;Non-compliance is necessary to avoid prejudice to the investigation, prevention, or prosecution of offences, or for the purposes of court proceedings;Compliance would prejudice the purposes of the collection; orThat compliance is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances of the particular case; orThat the information will not be used in a form in which the individual concerned is identified or will be used for statistical or research purposes and will not be published in a form that could reasonably be expected to identify the individual concerned. If you are uncertain of your obligations you must consult with your Manager, who may consult with a University Privacy Officer.Occasional or ad hoc collections, such as individual research projects, may require the provision of specific privacy notices relating to that collection.Where a new collection, use or disclosure of personal information is to become a routine part of University process, the responsible member of the University Community must ensure that the Privacy Officer is notified and the relevant privacy statement is updated to reflect this.\nMethod of collection\nPersonal information must only be collected in ways that are lawful and, in the circumstances, not unfair or unreasonably intrusive. This maintains personal dignity and protects data subjects from disproportionate or overly intrusive practices. Unlawful collection methods are those that are prohibited by law.Unfair collection methods could include not telling data subjects that information is being collected or deceiving data subjects about the purpose for collecting information. There are some instances where such collection methods may be appropriate (e.g., when conducting research), where there are other protections or processes establishing appropriate ethical protections.Unreasonably intrusive collection methods could include collecting sensitive personal information in a public space or using CCTV cameras in sensitive locations such as bathrooms.The University Community must be especially careful when collecting personal information from children or young people (such as some students and prospective students) to ensure that the collection is fair. This might include providing a simple summary of our privacy statement or ensuring that a child\u2019s caregiver is aware that we are collecting personal information about their child. Where a student is 18 years or older it is expected that the University will liaise with them directly in respect of collecting their personal information.\nCollection of sensitive personal information\nSome jurisdictions the University might operate in \u2013 including the EU, China and Australia \u2013 specifically regulate the collection of sensitive personal information. Where the University is directly and knowingly collecting information for people located in these jurisdictions, we must obtain consent to collect sensitive personal information, unless that information is being collected for the purposes of public health management (such as pandemic management), the delivery of health services to the individual, for occupational or employment purposes or in order to respond to an emergency (e.g., concerning a threat to the life or safety of an individual or individuals).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Security and retention of personal information (including access)\nSecurity\nAll members of the University Community have a responsibility to protect the personal information they handle against loss, misuse, or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.Before sharing personal information with a contracted service provider, the University Community must ensure that the service provider is required and able to provide an adequate level of protection to the personal information shared. This will usually be achieved by entering into a binding contract with the third party that includes a minimum set of privacy obligations on the third party.\nAccess\nMembers of the University Community must only access personal information that is required by them to carry out a function of their University employment or research or study. Any subsequent use of the information must also be clearly based on professional need.Access to personal information, which is to be granted in accordance with the established approval processes for each system and/or data set, should only be granted to a member of the University Community if there is a legitimate need.It is the responsibility of the Head of Department (or their delegate) to ensure access to personal information is removed when no longer required by a role or individual.Access to personal information about students must be managed in accordance with the Authorisation of Access to Student Information Procedure.\nRetention\nMembers of the University Community must not retain personal information for longer than the University has a lawful purpose to use it, and must delete information in compliance with the Information and Records Management Policy.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use and disclosure of personal information\nAnticipated uses and disclosures\nExcept as provided in clause 3(b) below, personal information must only be used or disclosed by the University Community if that use or disclosure is the purpose for which the information was collected, and has been made clear to the data subject in the relevant privacy statement (if applicable).\nNew uses and disclosures\nBefore using or disclosing personal information in new ways, or in ways that are not part of the University\u2019s routine business, the University Community must ensure that this is necessary for a lawful purpose or is otherwise permitted or required by law, including where any one of the following Privacy Act exceptions applies: the relevant data subject has authorised the University to use or disclose their information in this waythe use or disclosure is directly related to the purposes for which the information was collectedthe information will be de-identified (anonymised)the information was collected from a public source (such as information collected from public social media accounts), and it would not be unfair or unreasonable in the circumstances to use or disclose it in this waythe use or disclosure is necessary to assist with the investigation, prevention, or prosecution of offences (such as using gathering evidence of staff fraud), or for the purposes of court proceedingsthe use or disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious threat to life or health (such as tracking staff location for pandemic management), orthe use or disclosure is required or permitted by another law (such as the Education and Training Act 2020 or the Education (Pastoral Care of Tertiary and International Learners) Code of Practice 2021).Where authorisation (or consent) is the lawful basis relied upon to process personal information, the University Community must ensure that this consent is: express \u2013 which means a clear, affirmative action, not a pre-selected boxfreely given \u2013 which means there are no conditions attached to the consent (such as the inability to provide a service), or there are no power imbalances at play (such as in the employment relationship)current and specific \u2013 which means perpetual or very general consents should be avoidedinformed \u2013 which means ensuring the data subject is made fully aware what personal information and processing the consent relates to, andclear \u2013 which means simple and in plain language.Third party requests for personal information that are not part of routine University business \u2013 including requests from other universities, family of students, government departments, or law enforcement agencies \u2013 must be escalated to a Privacy Officer.Personal information must not be disclosed to third parties based overseas without the approval of the Privacy Officer, who must consider whether the overseas third party is subject to privacy requirements that are equivalent to those contained in the Privacy Act. This will usually be achieved by entering into a binding contract with the third party that includes a minimum set of privacy obligations on the third party.\u00a0\u00a0Where that is not practicable, the University may obtain the informed consent of the data subject for the disclosure (such as when disclosing personal information to overseas thesis supervisors).\nUsing AI tools to make automated decisions\nThe University might develop, procure, or use AI tools to assist us to make inferences or automated decisions about individuals. These tools might be used to manage course administration processes, deliver services (such as remote examination proctoring), or for the purposes of data analytics.The use of AI tools can raise significant privacy risks, and is subject to specific regulation in some jurisdictions (such as the EU). The use of AI tools should be managed on the basis of the following risk threshold: Unacceptable risk \u2013 Tools intended to infer the emotions of individuals in the education or employment context, or intended to infer sensitive attributes about individuals (such as race or sexual orientation).High risk \u2013 Tools intended to automate the processing of personal information in order to determine access or admission to study programmes, to evaluate learning outcomes, to steer a student\u2019s learning process, or to monitor student behaviour during examinations, or to otherwise automate decisions that could have a significant impact on the rights or interests of data subjects.Low risk \u2013 Tools that do not make decisions about individuals or automate important processes.The University Community must not use AI tools for any purposes that fall into the unacceptable risk category. The one exception is academic research, provided it satisfies ethical requirements, is compliant with the Health Information Privacy Code and any applicable law, and is compliant with the privacy expectations of the source of the information.If a member of the University Community intends to develop, procure, or use AI tools for any purposes that fall into the high risk category, they must complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA \u2013 see clause 5 below) and obtain the approval of the Privacy Officer.When using an AI tool which collects, processes or handles personal information, the University Community must: Where possible, use best efforts to ensure the data used to train, run or prompt the tool is fit for purpose, including that it is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant, and that it does not raise issues of bias.Be transparent with data subjects about the use of the tool. This might include updating our privacy statements to provide notice about such use.Ensure that the University has a lawful basis to process the personal information within the tool, such as where the processing is directly related to the purposes for which the information was collected.Review outputs or outcomes from the tool to ensure that they meet expectations, are lawful and ethical, and do not adversely impact on individuals or communities in unexpected or unintended ways.If using an AI tool to automate significant decisions about data subjects, ensure that the affected data subjects can challenge those decisions with a human, and can object to the use of such tools to make decisions about them (see clause 4(c)(v) below).If developing a low risk AI tool such as a chatbot, ensure that individuals are made aware that they are interacting with an AI system not a human.The University Community must also be mindful that poor model performance, inadequate monitoring, bias and discrimination, copyright infringement, lack of explainability, and inadequate governance create particular risks when using AI to collect, process or handle personal information.\nSpecific considerations in relation to using generative AI tools to process personal information\nThe University Community must use generative AI tools in accordance with the Use of Generative-Artificial Intelligences and Autonomous Content Generation in Learning and Teaching Policy, which includes a requirement to ensure privacy issues are appropriately managed.The University Community must be mindful of the privacy risks created by using both public and enterprise generative AI tools to process personal information (either in training or in inference) including: Accuracy \u2013 The personal information intended to be processed within the tool must be fit for purpose. This requires checking (where possible) that the information is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant, and that it does not raise issues of bias.Use and disclosure \u2013 The University must have a lawful basis to use or disclose personal information within the tool. Processing personal information via public tools increases the risk of subsequent uses or disclosures that are unlawful.Security and retention \u2013 It is difficult to determine how secure public tools are. Once information is ingested into the tool, it may not be possible to delete it.Access and correction \u2013 Data subjects can ask to access or correct their personal information that is being processed within a tool, which could be extremely difficult to manage in practice. If these risks cannot be managed or mitigated then AI may not be the right tool in the circumstances.The University Community must not use public generative AI tools to process personal or confidential information.If a member of the University Community intends to use an enterprise generative AI tool to process personal information, they must complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA \u2013 see clause 5 below) and obtain the approval of the Privacy Officer.\nAccuracy\nMembers of the University Community must take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is accurate and up to date before using or disclosing it, particularly where this use or disclosure could impact on the rights or interests of the data subject.\nProcessing sensitive personal information\nSome jurisdictions the University might operate in \u2013 including the EU, China and Australia \u2013 specifically regulate the processing of sensitive personal information. Where the University is delivering services to students or other people located in these jurisdictions, we must obtain consent to process sensitive personal information, unless that information is being processed for the purposes of public health management (such as pandemic management), the delivery of health services to the individual, or for occupational or employment purposes or in order to respond to an emergency (e.g., concerning a threat to the life or safety of an individual or individuals).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data subject rights\nPrivacy laws give the University\u2019s data subjects important privacy rights, which support transparency and accountability, protect individual autonomy and give data subjects some control over the way we collect, retain, use and share their information. The specific rights a data subject has will depend on their geographic location and applicable privacy laws in that jurisdiction.Data subject rights requests must be managed in accordance with the procedural requirements set out in privacy laws, including: The University must respond to a request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case not later than 20 working days after the day on which the request is received. The response must include the following information: That the University does not hold the personal information in a way that enables the information to be readily retrieved; orThat the University does not hold any personal information about the individual to whom the request relates; orThat the University does hold personal information about the individual to whom the request relates and, if access to the information has been requested, that \u2013 Access to that information, or some of that information, is granted; orAccess to that information, or some of that information, is refused and the grounds for refusal; orThe University neither confirms nor denies that it holds any personal information about the individual to whom the request relates.The University does not necessarily have to provide the personal information at the same time as they provide the individual with their decision. However, if the University has agreed to provide personal information it will need to do so without undue delay.It is important that members of the University Community who receive data subject rights requests can recognise those requests and escalate them quickly to the relevant Privacy Officer.Information should be released in the form preferred by the requester, unless doing so would impair the University\u2019s efficient administration.The University Community must take reasonable steps to ensure that we are releasing personal information to the data subject only, unless they authorise us to release it to someone else.The University Community may charge a reasonable fee to process a request, but should not generally do so, and any fee must be approved by a Privacy Officer.Depending on their location, the University\u2019s data subjects may have the right to: Access \u2013 Ask the University to confirm whether or not we are processing their personal information and, if we are, ask us for a copy of their information.Correction \u2013 Ask the University to correct personal information about them that they think is wrong. If we do not agree the data subject can ask us to attach a statement of correction to the information.Erasure (if the data subject is based in the EU or China) \u2013 Ask the University to erase their personal information if: it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collectedthey have withdrawn their consent for the processing of the information (where the processing was based on consent)we have accepted their objection to processing, and we have no other lawful basis to retain itit has been processed unlawfully, orthis is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, andwe are not required to retain it under the Public Records Act or the University General Disposal Authority.Restrict processing (if the data subject is based in the EU or China) \u2013 Ask the University to restrict the processing of their personal information if: the accuracy of the personal information is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracythe processing is unlawful, but they do not want it to be erasedit is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but it is still needed to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, orthey have objected to processing, and we are still considering that objection.Object to processing \u2013 Object to the processing of their personal information, where the University is processing personal information based on its legitimate interests, including where this involves automated decision-making.Withdraw consent \u2013 Withdraw their consent, if they have given the University consent for the processing of their personal information. Note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing of personal information that has been carried out based on the consent before its withdrawal.All data subject rights requests must be escalated to the relevant Privacy Officer.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)\nWhere applicable, the University endeavours to take a \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d approach to the development of new or changed processes or systems. This means that we adhere to the following principles: Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedialPrivacy as the defaultPrivacy embedded into designFull functionality \u2013 Positive-sum, not zero-sumEnd-to-end security \u2013 Lifecycle protectionVisibility and transparency, andRespect for user privacyAny member of the University Community responsible for creating or changing a process or system, that involves a new collection, use or disclosure of personal information or that may impact the security or integrity of personal information already held by the University, must complete a PIA and consult on this PIA with a Privacy Officer. You can access a copy of the PIA template:Privacy Impact Assessment template (DOCX)At a minimum, a PIA must be completed in any of the following situations, which may be likely to create high privacy risk: processing sensitive personal informationdeveloping, procuring, or using AI tools for any purposes that fall into the high risk category as set out at section 3(g)(ii) aboveusing generative AI tools to process personal informationprocuring a new third party service provider to store or process personal information on the University\u2019s behalf, ordisclosing personal information to a new third party, including an overseas third party.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Privacy breach management\nAll members of the University Community must ensure that any privacy breach they become aware of is reported promptly to a Privacy Officer in compliance with the applicable Privacy Breach Management Procedure.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roles and responsibilities\nThe Audit and Risk Committee, which is a University Council committee, is responsible for: providing oversight and monitoring, including through receipt of regular management reports, of University of Otago's privacy status and obtaining assurance from internal and external information systems auditors.The Vice-Chancellor is responsible for: advocating cultural values that promote good privacy practice, andsupporting the Privacy Officer and others to ensure personal information is managed in accordance with this policyThe Privacy Officer is responsible for: supporting the University Community to understand and comply with this policy, including by maintaining and developing relevant procedures, standards and guidelinesdeveloping and offering privacy training as requiredassisting with the management of privacy breaches, data subject rights requests, and other privacy issuesmanaging privacy complaints from data subjectsreporting on privacy breaches and general privacy compliance to the Audit and Risk Committee and, where required, the Vice-Chancellor, andliaising with third parties in respect of privacy matters, including the Privacy Commissioner or other relevant regulators and data subjects.All managers are responsible for: supporting staff to understand and comply with this policy and participate in any privacy training provided by the University, andensuring privacy breaches, data subject rights requests, and other privacy issues are identified and managed in accordance with this policy.All members of the University Community are responsible for: knowing and understanding their privacy responsibilitiescomplying with this policy and any associated proceduresactively participating in any privacy training provided by the University, andreporting any privacy breaches, data subject rights requests, or other privacy issues to the Privacy Officer",

        "name": "Additional_Leave_Policy",
        "scope": "All staff employed by the University of Otago for twelve months or more, excluding casual and student employees.",
        "content": "Approval and administrative processThe management delegations and administrative process for requesting, approving, recording and amending Additional Leave will be the same as for Annual Leave. Additional Leave will be recorded in the Staff Web Kiosk unless alternative arrangements have been agreed.Purchasing Additional LeaveSubject to prior approval, staff can purchase Additional Leave via deduction from their fortnightly pay in one-week blocks.A maximum of 5 one-week blocks can be purchased in any 12-month period.Each 12-month period starts from the commencement fortnight.Where a staff member holds more than one appointment, they must submit a separate application for each appointment.Heads considering applications for purchasing Additional Leave will apply the same considerations that apply for Annual Leave approvals including consideration of the operational requirements of their area and the requirements of any external agencies such as Te Whatu Ora \u2013 Health New Zealand.Deductions from salary for Additional Leave will commence in the first available pay period after approval.Additional Leave will be available to take after it is has accrued. e.g. if you have paid for a day then you can use that day.Additional Leave will accrue daily, based on standard hours worked. The calculation of the Additional Leave deduction is based on 26 fortnights and/or a 365-day year.\u00a0\u00a0It includes variations in employment conditions including changes to salary, hours, and FTE .Staff and Heads are expected to maintain Additional Leave balances below 5 weeks at any point in time.Approving Additional LeaveHeads considering requests to take Additional Leave must ensure that staff in their area have sufficient opportunity to take all their leave.Additional Leave can be utilised in addition to other paid leave options such as Annual Leave or Long Service Leave.Taking Additional LeaveAdditional Leave taken will be paid at an employee's normal pay rate current at the time taken.With approval, accrued Additional Leave can be taken at any point after the first Commencement Fortnight (and first deduction) has been completed.Where the Staff Member or a person dependent on them becomes sick, or bereavement occurs when the Staff Member is on Additional Leave, then the approver will permit the period of sickness to be debited against their sick leave entitlement, and the period of bereavement to be debited against their bereavement leave entitlement, as the case may be, provided a medical certificate is produced for the sick leave. Additional Leave recommences once the sick leave or the bereavement leave period is over, provided it was within the timeframes for which Additional Leave was originally sought.",

        "q4_response": "After reviewing the policy data, I have identified some redundancy and potential improvements:\n\n1. **Redundancy**: The section on \"Purchasing Additional Leave\" seems redundant as it is only an explanation of the process for requesting additional leave, which is already covered in other sections.\n2. **Structure**: The policy document could benefit from clearer headings and subheadings to break up the content and improve readability.\n3. **Repetition**: Some sentences, such as \"Staff and Heads are expected to maintain Additional Leave balances below 5 weeks at any point in time,\" seem repeated or worded similarly elsewhere in the document.\n4. **Cross-references**: The policy mentions cross-referencing to other policies (e.g., Annual Leave Policy), but it would be better to include actual links or references to these policies for clarity and consistency.\n5. **Procedure vs. Policy**: As noted by `q2_response`, this is actually a procedure document rather than a policy. Consider labeling the document as such and separating procedures from policy statements where applicable.\n\nTo improve the structure and readability, consider:\n\n1. Creating separate sections for different aspects of additional leave (e.g., accrual, purchasing, utilizing).\n2. Using bullet points or numbered lists to present guidelines and procedures clearly.\n3. Adding clear headings and subheadings to break up the content.\n4. Considering a more concise writing style to reduce repetition and improve clarity.\n\nOverall, the policy data appears to be comprehensive, but with some minor adjustments, it can become even clearer and easier to follow."

In exceptional cases, such as where a Professor resigns to take up a distinguished public position, they may be eligible for consideration upon resignation rather than upon retirement.Nominees being considered for the title will have ten years' continuous service as an academic employee with the University.Nominees who have had breaks in service may be considered for the award of the title of Emeritus Professor if they have had a continuous association with the University during the period of the break.Awarding of the title will be initiated by the University and should not be considered as a natural consequence of meeting the eligibility requirements.Criteria for the Award of the TitleThe Emeritus appointee will have continued to meet the expectations for a professor at the University of Otago through to the time of their retirement , including: showing leadership in fostering excellence in research, professional practice, teaching, and servicehaving an outstanding record of scholarly and professional achievement in their relevant discipline area and/or their professionmaking a significant contribution to the wider community (locally, nationally and internationally) in a manner consistent with the sphere of influence of their academic disciplinehaving the respect and esteem of their colleagues within the University and within their disciplinecontributing to the life of the University with distinction.When considering the award of the title the decision-makers will consider whether the evidence provided meets the above criteria. It will be considered as a whole.Procedure for the Award of the TitleAt the time of approval of retirement of a Professor, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, in consultation with the Dean or Head of Department, shall consider whether the Professor should be nominated for Emeritus status in accordance with clauses 2 and 3 above.Where the Pro-Vice-Chancellor considers the criteria for the award have not been met, they will discuss the case with the Vice-Chancellor, who will determine whether a nomination should be made to the Staffing Advisory Committee\u201d.On request, Human Resources will provide information on the retiring Professor's service as it relates to eligibility for the title.Nomination for the title is made by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor to the Staffing Advisory Committee. The nomination must include: nomination letter which states the home department and disciplinecurriculum vitaeshort biographyThe Staffing Advisory Committee considers whether the nominee meets the criteria and advises the Vice-Chancellor accordingly.The Vice-Chancellor considers the nomination and may submit a recommendation to the University Council.Where Council approves the award of the title of Emeritus Professor, the Registrar and Secretary to the Council writes to the retiring staff member to advise of the awardHuman Resources will record the Emeritus Professor's status.Entitlements and responsibilitiesThe University provides to Emeritus Professors ongoing use of the University Staff username and ID card, and in association: use of the Professor's existing personal University of Otago email accountLibrary services as for academic staffaccess to the University travel insurance schemeaccess to the University of Otago Staff ClubEmeritus Professors are expected to comply with all University policies and regulations that apply to their ongoing association with the University.The Department is responsible for ensuring that Emeritus Professors are informed of University policy changes that may affect them.The Department may provide facilities and support to Emeritus Professors where appropriate.Emeritus Professors are listed in the University Calendar.On any ceremonial or official occasion Emeritus Professors rank in precedence before Professors in the University but after holders of honorary degrees of the University.The Council of the University retains the right, at its discretion, to withdraw the award of this title if it considers that the individual is not acting in the spirit of the appointment or brings the University into disrepute.",

For example, stating that the Council of the University has the right to withdraw the award if an individual is not acting in the spirit of the appointment is already implied by other sections of the policy.\n\n5. **Unclear scope**: The 'Entitlements and responsibilities' policy document could benefit from a clearer explanation of its scope and applicability. Who exactly does this policy apply to, and under what circumstances? Clarifying this would help ensure that the policy is understood correctly by all stakeholders.\n\nOverall, while the provided JSON data highlights some potential issues with the policies, it is essential to note that these are just observations based on a single data point.

It applies to students transferring from other universities as if their previous study had been undertaken at the University of Otago.",
        "content": "1.Summary\nThe University sets minimum standards of academic performance. Students who are not achieving satisfactorily across their course of study will receive specifically-targeted advice and assistance as early as possible and appropriate, and the opportunity to be involved in planning their future study carefully with a Designated Adviser of Studies.Students will be restricted in the number of attempts they may make to pass any given paper.Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress across their course of study (i.e. who fail to pass half or more of the points enrolled for in a calendar year) will be placed on Conditional Enrolment. In their next year of study, such students may enrol for a Prescribed Course of Study only, and if they pass fewer than half of the points enrolled for, they will be suspended from the University for the subsequent two calendar years. Students on Conditional Enrolment are required to engage with a Designated Adviser of Studies before any course is approved.\n2.Repeating of Failed Papers\nA student may attempt to pass a given paper no more than three times. A student who has failed a paper three times shall not be permitted to re-enrol in that paper.Enrolling for Final Examination Only in the paper concerned, or enrolling in a paper with a different paper code which is specifically intended for students repeating the paper concerned, shall count as an attempt in terms of clause 2(a).In exceptional circumstances, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division responsible for the relevant paper, or their nominee, may approve a variation to clause 2(a) and permit further enrolment in the paper.Students that have enrolled for a third time in a paper will be contacted at the start of the paper and provided with targeted advice from a Designated Adviser of Studies.\n3.Conditional Enrolment\nThose students who do not pass half of the points enrolled for in a year will be advised that they will be placed on Conditional Enrolment the next Year they enrol.In the next year in which they enrol, students placed on Conditional Enrolment will be required to consult a Designated Adviser of Studies and enrol for a prescribed course of study.Each student placed on Conditional Enrolment will need to make formal application to enrol for a prescribed course of study, which must include provision of a satisfactory Back on Track Plan to a relevant Designated Adviser of Studies.A Designated Adviser of Studies will require a student on Conditional Enrolment to meet with them or make other suitable arrangements to discuss their Back on Track Plan.A Designated Adviser of Studies may approve a Conditional Enrolment student's course subject to such a discussion taking place.The prescribed course of study will be approved by the Designated Adviser of Studies, taking into account the student's previous academic record, previous experience and personal circumstances. Part-time study is permitted. The following restrictions will normally apply: no more than 54 points may be taken in each semester, and no more than 18 points in Summer School.no timetable clashes will be approved, andpermission will not be granted to enrol in any papers for which pre-requisites have not been met.If a student placed on Conditional Enrolment has already been approved for Final Examination Only enrolment in one or more papers, the Designated Adviser of Studies may review that approval in consultation with the relevant Head(s) of Academic Unit. Such approval may be rescinded, if the Designated Adviser of Studies and Head of Academic Unit concerned consider that to be appropriate.Disagreements that cannot be resolved between a student on Conditional Enrolment and the Designated Adviser of Studies will be referred to the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor for resolution.The prescribed course of study will be reviewed after the first semester of the year under consideration. Any changes to the prescribed course of study shall require the approval of the Designated Adviser of Studies, and restrictions as detailed in 3(f) above shall continue to apply.If half or more of the points enrolled for in the prescribed course of study across the full year of Conditional Enrolment are passed, Conditional Status will be lifted.\n4.Suspension from Study\nIf fewer than half of the points enrolled for in the prescribed course of study across the full year of Conditional Enrolment are passed, the student will be suspended from the University for a period of two years.Any Final Examination Only approvals granted prior to suspension, and still to be taken up, will be cancelled upon suspension.A student suspended under the Academic Progress Policy may request a review of the suspension decision by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor. Such requests, supported by documentation as appropriate, must be made in writing to the Director Student Experience within 14 days of the notification of suspension. Late applications will be considered only in exceptional circumstances.Students suspended under the Academic Progress Policy will be regarded as Recommencing Students if they register to return to study at the University of Otago after their suspension period. (For details on the admission requirements for Recommencing Students, see Clause 10.4 of the Admission to University Statute 2011.)Students who meet the requirements to return to study at the University after their suspension period will be placed on Conditional Enrolment in the year in which they recommence their studies.\n5.Transferring Students and Subsequent Study\nThe provisions of this policy shall be applied to students transferring from other tertiary institutions, with the academic record of such students being assessed at the point of transfer and the Academic Progress Policy being applied as if the academic record were a University of Otago record.Students suspended or excluded under the academic progress policies (or equivalent) of other tertiary institutions will not be permitted to transfer to the University of Otago until such time as that suspension has passed.A student with Conditional Status who is permitted to enrol in a course of study at the University of Otago that is not otherwise covered by this Policy and who passes half or more of the points enrolled for in a calendar year shall have Conditional Status lifted.",

        "scope": "This Policy applies to all University of Otago-owned artworks on all campuses, with the exception of artworks and related materials held in the Hocken Collections and managed directly by the University of Otago Library.",
        "content": "Purpose of collectionsThe main purposes for which the University holds artworks are: enhancing and reflecting the culture and character of the Universityrecognising the longstanding place and presence of mana whenuaenriching or embellishing the University's buildings and campus for the benefit of staff, students and visitorsrecognising individuals and events connected with the Universityuse for research and educationrecognising the links between the University and wider community.Criteria for the collectionsAll artworks acquired and held by the University should: fulfil one or more of the purposes set out in clause 1be reasonably able to be displayed and maintained by the Universityhave clear title and be legally, ethically and culturally appropriate for the University to hold, andfor new acquisitions, meet priority level 1 or 2 as defined in clause 2. (b).Priorities: Level 1: Artworks by significant artists where the artist or subject matter is closely associated with the University, artworks by Frances Hodgkins Fellows, artworks that are part of a subject-specific collection (e.g. College of Education collection of book illustrations).Level 2: Artworks where the artist or subject matter is closely associated with the University.Level 3: Other artworks.Process of acquisitionArtwork can be acquired by individual departments when it is an approved part of building work (i.e. embellishment), or when the acquisition is funded from the department's budget or from donations or bequests specific to the department. Artwork can also be acquired centrally through the Office of the Vice-Chancellor and the Art Collections Committee in accordance with relevant budgets, donations, or bequests.Departments should ensure that any artwork they acquire is consistent with the criteria in clause 2, and that the department can meet ongoing costs of maintenance and curation.Acquisitions by departments must be made in consultation with the Artworks Collection Committee, who will assess the works against the criteria in clause 3 prior to purchase.When a department acquires an artwork they must notify the Collections Administrator who will update the Collections Catalogue. Where required by the University's Fixed Assets Procedure, the department's Asset Register should also be updated.Holding artworksArtworks will generally be located within the department responsible for their acquisition. Artworks acquired through the Office of the Vice-Chancellor may be located anywhere appropriate within the University at the Vice-Chancellor's discretion. Artworks which do not have a responsible Department or Office will be allocated by Property Services Division. Where a bequest or donation includes criteria about where or how an artwork is displayed, these criteria will be respected to the extent that this is practically possible.For conservation and insurance purposes, the current location of all artworks must be recorded in the Collections Catalogue.Where a department wishes to shift an artwork's location within the department it should make a formal request to Property Services Division, who will evaluate the extent of expertise required to shift the artwork and assess the suitability of the intended location.Shifting artworks between departments or campuses requires the prior approval of the Collections Administrator.Artworks which have specific security measures (i.e. cameras or sensors) may only be shifted with the prior approval of the Director, Property Services Division, and only when appropriate security is in place.LoansAll loans from the collection are made at the discretion of the Artworks Collection Committee.Requests for loans within the University community can be made directly to the Committee and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If granted, the Committee determines the terms and length of the loan.Loans from the collection outside the University, which will only be considered if the request is from an accredited institution, professional gallery or museum, will be reviewed by the Artworks Collection Committee.A loan contract and condition report shall be issued with all approved loans and tracked throughout the loan period by Property Services Division. The borrowing institution accepts all responsibility for insurance, shipping, and repair costs associated with the loan unless otherwise specified in the loan contract.Loans to the University must be approved by the Artworks Collection Committee. Loans are not permitted without a loan contract and condition report.Maintenance and ConservationThe University is responsible for keeping all artworks it holds in the best possible condition.Property Services Division will arrange for the formal monitoring of an artwork's condition, the frequency and extent of which will be determined by the nature of the workDepartments holding artworks have an ongoing obligation to proactively monitor their condition and advise Property Services Division if any damage or deterioration is observed.The cost of any repairs, conservation or security measures to artworks held in departments, which will be organised by Property Services Division, will be met by the department.DeaccessionDeaccession will only occur in exceptional circumstances, and will normally only be considered where: the artwork does not fit the purpose of the collectionthe University is unable to display the artwork for reasons of practicality or safetythe University is unable to adequately conserve the artwork, or the costs of doing so outweigh the artwork's value to the University, and/orthe artwork is inappropriate for the University to retain due to legal, ethical or cultural considerations.Artworks bought by the University with its own funds can be deaccessed if appropriate at any time.Artworks donated or bequeathed to the University (or funded by a donation or bequest) should only be deaccessed if the deaccession is in accordance with the Collection Receipt or any agreement made at the time the artwork was acquired, or by subsequent agreement with the benefactor or their descendants.Should an artwork be discovered to have been received improperly or illegally, it should be deaccessed in a way which best redresses its acquisition.Deaccession is recommended by the Artworks Collection Committee and is subject to approval by the Registrar or Vice-Chancellor. Priority Level 1 artworks are deaccessed by decision of the University Council. At the time of deaccession, the Collections Administrator\u00a0\u00a0removes the artwork from the Collections Catalogue and the Asset Register but retains a permanent record of its acquisition, holding and deaccession.Any funds raised from the sale of artworks will be applied to the purchase of other artworks by the University, in a manner consistent with the purpose of the original purchase, donation or bequest.",

General Principles\nThe General Principles set out the standard of behaviour which is required and cover a wide range of situations.\n2. Examples Of Breaches of General Principles\nWithout limiting the application of the general principles, the following are specific categories of non-tolerated behaviours.\na. Sexual Harassment\n\u201cSexual harassment\u201d has the meaning given to it in section 62 of the Human Rights Act 1993, which defines sexual harassment as:\nthe making of a request of any other person for sexual intercourse, sexual contact, or other form of sexual activity which contains an implied or overt promise of preferential treatment or an implied or overt threat of detrimental treatment; orby the use of language (whether written or spoken) of a sexual nature, or of visual material of a sexual nature, or by physical behaviour of a sexual nature, to subject any other person to behaviour that: is unwelcome or offensive to that person (whether or not that is conveyed to the person complained about); andis either repeated, or of such a significant nature, that it has a detrimental effect on that person. Nothing in this section shall apply to the use or presentation of language or materials, which is reasonably required for bona fide educational purposes.\nb. Racial Harassment\n\u201cRacial harassment\u201d has the meaning given to it in section 63 of the Human Rights Act 1993, which defines racial harassment as the use of language (whether written or spoken), or visual material, or physical behaviour that:\nexpresses hostility against, or brings into contempt or ridicule, any other person on the ground of the colour, race, or ethnic or national origins of that person; andis hurtful or offensive to that other person (whether or not that is conveyed to the person complained about); andis either repeated, or of such a significant nature, that it has a detrimental effect on that other person.\nNothing in this section shall apply to the use or presentation of language or materials, which is reasonably required for bona fide educational purposes.\nc. Discrimination\n\u201cDiscrimination\u201d means conduct which:\nresults or is likely to result in less favourable treatment, or creates or is likely to create a less favourable environment, for any person or group of people than for another person or group of people in the same or similar circumstances by reason of any of the prohibited grounds set out in section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993; anddoes not fall within any of the relevant exceptions in Part II of the Human Rights Act 1993.The prohibited grounds of discrimination, based on section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 are:sex, including pregnancy and childbirth;marital status;religious belief;ethical belief;colour;race;ethnic or national origins, which includes nationality and citizenship;disability;age;political opinion;employment status;family status;sexual orientation and gender identity.Discrimination may arise from official statements, actions, omissions, decisions or policies as well as from informal or personal statements or conduct. It may also be indirect, that is, have the effect of treating someone differently even if the discrimination is not explicit.Actions by the University constituting affirmative actions and policies to assist or advance a particular group are not discrimination. These actions and policies will be made public to the University community.\nd. Personal Harassment and Bullying\n\"Personal harassment\" means any objectionable or offensive behaviour (expressed or implied) by a member of the University community in relation to another member of the University community, which:\nintimidates, humiliates, undermines or dominates that other person;\u00a0\u00a0 orinvolves the use of abusive and/or threatening language, verbal or physical threats or any form of\u00a0\u00a0 physical assault.\nPersonal harassment may occur as a result of a significant one-time incident or as a result of more minor incidents occurring over a period of time.\nBullying is a form of personal harassment which is especially characterised by persistent and offensive, abusive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour (express or implied) which makes the recipient(s) feel upset, threatened, humiliated or vulnerable, undermines their self-confidence and/or causes them to suffer stress. It may include emotional abuse, isolation, economic abuse, abuse of authority, denying and blaming, coercion and threats that create a risk to an individual's health and safety.\ne. Abuse of Supervisory Authority\n\u201cAbuse of supervisory authority\u201d means conduct (express or implied), by a supervisor in relation to another member of the University community that exceeds the normal authority of a supervisor and which:\nintimidates, humiliates or undermines that other person by belittling them, or excessively, destructively or inappropriately criticising or reprimanding them, or excessively scrutinising their work; ormakes demands that are unreasonable or outside that other person's role or activity within the University; ormakes a demand to perform an action that is in breach of the principles of any policy of the University.\nFor the purpose of this section, an academic will be deemed to have supervisory authority over the students enrolled in her/his class.\nAn abuse of supervisory authority may occur in situations where a decision on benefits or opportunities of an academic, employment or other nature, has been influenced by considerations which are, or should be, irrelevant to the decision. This is considered to be a conflict of interest and is addressed in 3 below.\nf. Unethical Intimate Personal Relationships\nThe University strongly discourages, and staff should avoid entering into, an intimate personal relationship with any student of the University, particularly a student for whom they have responsibility or with whom they have involvement through any kind of University activity.\nAn intimate personal relationship between a member of staff and a student seriously risks taking advantage of the intrinsic trust, power and status differential implicit in the staff-to-student relationship.\nIntimate personal relationships are relationships characterised by a significant level of intimacy between the participants and include situations involving sexual activity of any kind.\nRelevant factors for the University to consider when determining whether a staff member has behaved unethically/inappropriately by entering into an intimate personal relationship with a student include, but are not limited to, the following:\nWhether there is an imbalance of power or statusIf the relationship is detrimental to the studentRisks unacceptable disruption to the student's study or work or their living environmentUndermines the trust and confidence the University has in the staff member\nIn addition, the University will consider whether the staff member gave careful, mature and sober consideration to all relevant ethical considerations, including those listed above, before and during the relationship.\nIf a staff member enters into a relationship with a student he/she is encouraged to seek advice immediately from the following people:\nMediatorHuman Resources Manager or AdvisorUnion\nStudents are encouraged to seek advice from the following:\nOUSA Support StaffMediator\nIf a relationship is considered to be not unethical but creates a conflict of interest under the provisions of the following clause, the staff member must follow the procedures set out in 4 below.\nSimilar considerations may arise in relationships between staff members, particularly where there is an imbalance of power or status between the staff members involved.\u00a0\u00a0The University may, after considering all relevant factors, determine a staff member has behaved unethically/inappropriately through involvement in an intimate personal relationship with another member of staff.\n3. Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest may arise in a range of situations where the personal, academic or financial interests of an individual improperly affect or could improperly affect the carrying out of that person's or another person's duties within the University. The conflict of interest is inherent within the existence of particular relationships, whether staff-staff or staff-student, and is not dependent upon any specific action. In settings where there is a difference in power between people, such as staff and students at the University, the potential for harm is greater and special care needs to be taken to avoid conflicts of interest.\nFailure to disclose a conflict of interest, in accordance with this policy, may be considered a disciplinary matter by the University.\na. Conflicts of Interest arising between Staff members\nSituations may occur where staff members are working with family members or persons with whom they have a close personal relationships. The existence of close or intimate personal relationships with a member of staff should not constitute a bar to the employment or promotion of any individual. Where such relationships exist between staff members or with prospective staff members there may be situations where there is the potential to create a conflict of interest, such as in supervisory relationships and employment-related decisions. The staff member must follow the procedures set out in 4 below.\nb. Conflicts of interest arising between Staff and students.\nAny member of staff may find themselves in a situation where a family or personal relationship with a student gives rise to a conflict of interest. A family/personal relationship between a staff member and student has the potential for, or could be perceived as, compromising the fundamental duties inherent in teaching and learning. Staff members have a responsibility to students to assess their work fairly, objectively and consistently across the candidature for their particular subject/course. It follows that members of staff should not be involved in supervision or assessment of students with whom they have a family, or personal relationship. In any such situation the staff member must follow the procedures set out in 4 below.\n4. Procedures for dealing with conflict of interest and potential conflict of interest.\nStaff members must inform, verbally and in writing, the person to whom they normally report, (e.g. Head of Department, Supervisor) if a conflict of interest arises or where they are uncertain as to whether a particular situation gives rise to a conflict of interest.If the person to whom they normally report is also potentially involved in the conflict of interest, the staff member must report to that person's manager.The person to whom the matter is reported must ensure that processes are put in place to manage or remove the conflict of interest in the best way possible and in a transparent manner, and the staff member will be an active participant in the process. This includes written documentation of the processes put in place.All reasonable steps must be taken to advise those who may be affected by the measures put in place.After arrangements have been made to manage or remove a conflict of interest, the person to whom such a staff member would normally report (or this person's manager) is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the situation. The purpose of such monitoring is to ensure the wellbeing of those involved and to ensure any measures put in place are not unduly affecting the work of others.\nFor detail and procedures relating to other conflicts of interest, refer to the University of Otago Conflicts of Interest Policy.\nAppendix 2: Informal Processes\nThe University encourages informal resolution of problems where possible. In some circumstances informal processes will be inappropriate because of the seriousness of the issues or incidents concerned and it is appropriate to move directly to the formal process. A range of people, including a contact person, a mediator, a Human Resources Advisor or a supervisor, can help a person decide whether the matter is best addressed by an informal or a formal process.\nSome of the more common informal processes are described below.\na. Individuals Addressing the Issue Themselves\nWhere matters are less serious people should consider resolving an issue with the other person. This would involve the person raising their concerns directly with the other person, either with or without a support person present.\nThe people under Section 2 (Processes for Action under the Policy: Advice and Support) are available to provide advice, support and coaching to assist people who wish to pursue this resolution process.\nb. Management or Third Party Involvement\nWhere a person does not wish to address the issue directly themselves, or where this would not be appropriate, they may ask the person to whom they report to intervene or they may ask a third party to broach the issue with the person on their behalf. It would be normal for either of these processes to be followed by a direct discussion between the parties to re-establish a constructive working relationship.\nc. Mediation\nHow is mediation used?\nMediation is used in a variety of situations in the University.\nThe University employs a mediator who is available to mediate all types of situations, as requested by staff and students.If everyone is willing, mediation is one way that problems can be informally resolved. This option can be accessed by self-referral, via a contact person, or by referral from a manager or a head of department/school/service or by contacting the University Mediator.Any member of the University community may approach the University Mediator to request mediation for matters outside the Policy. If the University Mediator considers that the matter is suitable for mediation and the other person agrees to participate, mediation can be used to help resolve a variety of concerns.Because mediation is confidential, only aggregated general statistical information, such as the number of people using the service, whether they are staff or students, and general categories of the issues being dealt with are reported by the University Mediator to the University.\nWhat is mediation?\nMediation is a conversation between people with the help of the mediator; it is an informal and voluntary process, in which the participants identify the issues, generate options and consider alternatives in order to reach a mutually acceptable solution. It is confidential and non-disciplinary. Participants enter the process willingly and may withdraw at any time.\nThe participants to the mediation retain all decision-making power. The mediator does not act as an advocate, a support person or a decision-maker but as a neutral facilitator. Mediation is a non-judgmental process that does not result in a winner and a loser, but in an outcome which is acceptable to both participants.\nAll things said and any notes written in mediation are confidential. This ensures that the participants can trust the process as an opportunity to resolve issues in an open, frank and honest manner. They decide whether any agreement they reach is made available and, if so, to whom. Sometimes even the fact that mediation is occurring or has occurred will be kept private.\nSupport people may be present at the mediation.\nWhat are the advantages of mediation?\nMediation is confidential and private and can often provide the quickest and easiest way for people to sort out their differences. It is non-adversarial and promotes a co-operative problem solving approach. It provides participants with an equal opportunity to have their say in a non-threatening environment.\nMediation often produces the best outcome because the issues and concerns can be fully canvassed and the participants themselves determine the outcome. This helps to repair the working relationships that have broken down in a conflict. The process is future-focused with the aim being to find creative ways to meet the real needs and interests of everyone involved.\nIt can be very helpful to talk with a mediator confidentially about the appropriateness of mediation and to weigh up the alternatives to mediation. Mediation is most successful when people use it earlier rather than later, before their differences have become entrenched, but it can help even with long-standing and intractable problems.\nMore information on mediation is available at http://www.otago.ac.nz/mediation/\nAppendix 3: Formal Complaints\n1. Options for Formal Complaint\nThe options available under the Ethical Behaviour Policy Formal Complaint Process are:\nIf the person complained about is a student, the person complaining may make a formal written complaint to the University Proctor requesting that consideration be given to the matter being dealt with under the Code of Student Conduct.If the person complained about is not a student, the person complaining may make a formal written complaint to the Director of Human Resources.Where appropriate the University may accept complaints from third parties and/or may pursue investigations of its own if it becomes aware of alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n2. Confidentiality\nSubject to the requirements of the investigation or any legal disclosure requirements, everyone involved in a formal or informal investigation has:\nthe right to have information they disclose kept confidential;the duty to respect the rights of others to the maintenance of confidence;the right to have any limits of confidentiality explained to them.\n3. Ethical Behaviour Policy Formal Complaint Process\na. When the person complained about is a Student\nA written complaint may be made to the University Proctor.\nThe procedure and potential outcomes following a formal written complaint against a student are those established by the Code of Student Conduct as adopted by Council and found in the University Calendar.\nb. When the Person complained about is not a Student\nWhen someone chooses not to use informal processes or use of informal processes has failed to resolve the problem, they may make a formal written complaint to the Director of Human Resources.\nThe formal written complaint must be signed and dated by the person complaining and should contain the following:\nthe name of the person complained about as well as sufficient details outlining the issue complained about;the name of any person who may have witnessed the breach of the policy or to whom the complaint was first reported;the outcomes which the complainant believes would be appropriate to resolve the matter;information on whether any measures to protect the person complaining are necessary.\nThe failure to include information in the formal written complaint does not nullify the complaint. The person complaining shall be available for an interview for clarification of the formal written complaint if considered necessary by the person receiving the complaint.\nThere is no time limit for the making of a formal complaint, although long delays may inhibit the ability of people to recall facts accurately and may limit the ability of the investigator to reach any conclusions.\nIf it is considered that every reasonable effort to settle the matter informally has not occurred, then if appropriate, the people involved may be encouraged that this occurs before a formal proceeding commences.\nUpon receipt of a formal complaint, or where the University considers that there might be an issue that needs to be investigated, there are two options:\na preliminary investigation may be carried out to assess whether or not there is a prima facie case to be investigated, oran investigator may be appointed to investigate the matters raised in the complaint. An investigator is a person with delegated authority from the Director of Human Resources appointed to investigate a formal complaint.\nIn certain circumstances the Director of Human Resources may consider that it is necessary to suspend the person complained about for the duration of the investigation.\nThe investigator of the complaint must respect the principles of natural justice which include the right of the person complained about:\nto be advised of enough details of the formal complaint and the investigation to allow them to make an informed response;to be given an opportunity to provide an explanation and make representations, including having their witnesses heard;to be supported by or represented by the person of their choice; andto have the matter assessed by an impartial person.\nThe investigator's role is to investigate the complaint impartially and the investigator is required to:\nprovide the person complained about with a letter informing them that a complaint has been received, giving details of the allegations and defining the process of the investigation;receive any comments, either in person or in writing, to that letter;carry out such investigation as is necessary;advise the person complained about of their preliminary views as to those findings and as to the penalty, if any;receive and consider representations on those preliminary views;make and advise the person complained about of the final decision on the findings and as to the penalty, if any;advise the person complaining in confidence that a final decision has been made and give appropriate details.",

        "scope": "This Policy applies to all staff and students of the University.",
        "content": "Preamble\nBilingualism and multilingualism are valued by the University. The empirical evidence that has been published in the last thirty years not only supports the idea that being brought up speaking two or more languages is definitely not a disadvantage, but that there are probably some subtle advantages, as well as the major benefit of being able to speak two languages and being comfortable in two cultures.\nSustainable bilingualism and biculturalism cannot be maintained on the basis of open and unlimited interaction between minorities and majorities. Te reo M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori language), like all minority languages, requires special measures to ensure its survival as a language used in a wide range of contexts and domains with an increasing number of fluent speakers. In order to promote te reo M\u0101ori use by staff and students, incentives need to be introduced to encourage this. 1\nThe importance of the language is reflected in the waiata composed for the Ng\u0101i Tahu reo r\u016bmaki ( M\u0101ori language immersion) hui at R\u0101paki marae in January 1998.\n He taoka te reo He kura pounamu Iti kahuraki M\u0101pihi maurea \nThe language is a treasure Like a greenstone pendant That which I strive to possess And carry with me always\nSir James Henare's comments on the importance of te reo M\u0101ori are also worth repeating.\nThe language is the core of our M\u0101ori culture and mana. Ko te reo te mauri o te mana M\u0101ori(The language is the life force of M\u0101ori mana). If the language dies, as some predict, what do we have left to us? Then, I ask our own people who are we?...Therefore the taonga, our M\u0101ori language, as far as our people are concerned, is the very soul of the M\u0101ori people.2\nOne of the provisions in the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987 is that te reo M\u0101ori is an official language of New Zealand.\n3. M\u0101ori language to be an official language of New Zealand \u2013 The M\u0101ori language is hereby declared to be an official language of New Zealand. 3\nSince 1997 the Government has had a M\u0101ori Language Strategy which government departments are currently implementing.\nThis University policy seeks to give effect to the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987 and is consistent with the University's Strategic Direction to 2005. The University will also be fulfilling a commitment to the articles of the Treaty of Waitangi as expressed in its Charter:\nto encourage greater M\u0101ori participation within the Universityto protect and promote te reo and tikanga M\u0101ori in a manner consistent with M\u0101ori cultural aspirations and preferences, and the practices of the Universityto support iwi initiatives that address iwi needsto develop mutually beneficial partnerships with iwi in research, teaching and administrationto promote research in te reo and tikanga M\u0101ori, health, education, current issues and history4\nPolicy\nThe University Vision Statement For Te Reo M\u0101ori\nThat te reo M\u0101ori becomes an ordinary, useful, relevant, vibrant and inspiring language as a medium of communication in a wide range of contexts.\nPrinciples\nPrinciple 1\nIn recognition of the status of te reo M\u0101ori as a taonga (treasure) protected under the Treaty of Waitangi, and within the spirit of the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987, the University of Otago will endorse the right of students and staff to use te reo M\u0101ori, including for assessment.\nPrinciple 2\nThe University of Otago will be proactive in the promotion of te reo M\u0101ori by:\nRecognising competence in M\u0101ori language as a valued skillUrging departments to recognise in their selection criteria the desirability of appointing staff who are bilingual in te reo M\u0101ori and English.Encouraging University staff, both academic and general, to take te reo M\u0101ori papers.Encouraging students to take te reo M\u0101ori papers as part of their degree.\nPrinciple 3\nThe University will ensure that written te reo M\u0101ori used in University publications is of a consistently high standard and will adhere to te reo M\u0101ori orthographic conventions set out by Te Taura Whiri i te Reo M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori Language Commission. It accepts all dialects of te reo M\u0101ori, reflecting the fact that it is a national rather than a regional university.\nPrinciple 4\nThe University will recognise the rangatiratanga and mana of mana/tangata whenua, especially Ng\u0101i Tahu, along with any existing or future agreements with such parties, which may impact on such relationships.\nPrinciple 5\nThe University will promote and encourage M\u0101ori culture.\nObjectives\nTo increase the number of people who speak te reo M\u0101ori by increasing their opportunities to learn the language.To improve the proficiency levels of people in speaking, listening, reading and writing te reo M\u0101ori.To increase the opportunities to use te reo M\u0101ori by increasing the number of situations where te reo M\u0101ori can be used.To foster amongst M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori positive attitudes towards and positive values about te reo M\u0101ori so that M\u0101ori-English bilingualism becomes a valued part of the University community and of New Zealand society. 5\nProcedures for Student Assessment in Te Reo M\u0101ori\nThe following procedures should be used for student assessment in te reo M\u0101ori:\nIn papers not taught in te reo M\u0101ori, candidates who intend to present all or part of an examination or piece of course work in te reo M\u0101ori are required to give notice of their intention to do so in writing6. They should write to the Head, Student Experience, Academic Services who will notify the Head of the Department in which the paper is offered. This notice of intention is necessary to allow the University the time to make suitable arrangements for marking including, when necessary, translation and external assessment. This notice should be given at the beginning of the paper and within the first three weeks of the semester in which the paper is taught.Every effort should be made by the Head of Department to have the examination or piece of work marked by a person qualified to assess the work in te reo M\u0101ori. This should be the examiner for the course if he/she is considered by the Head of Department, in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, to be linguistically competent to do so.If the examiner of the relevant paper is not competent to assess in te reo M\u0101ori, a co-examiner, competent in both the subject under examination and in te reo M\u0101ori, may be appointed by the Head of Department in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, and in agreement with the appropriate chief examiner, to conduct the assessment of work presented in te reo M\u0101ori. The University should take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances (taking into account the period of notice given and the time-frame of the assessment process) to appoint a suitable co-examiner from within or from outside the University. The objectives stated in the course outline of the paper concerned should be given to the marker of the script written in te reo M\u0101ori.If a suitable person is not available to assess the work in te reo M\u0101ori, a translator should be appointed by the Head of Department, in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, and in agreement with the appropriate chief examiner. The translator should be sent a photocopy of the original with the student's name removed. In the translation the translator should be asked not to correct errorsof content nor to make embellishments. However, ambiguities should be pointed out to the examiner. Where necessary, the examiner may seek clarification of the translation of the paper from the translator, but contact between the student and translator is prohibited. The assessment should be carried out by the course examiner on the basis of the translation.Resorting to translation of work or examinations should be made only when reasonable efforts to find an examiner capable of assessing the work in its original language have been exhausted. The Head of Department and Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the translator is competent in the relevant subject under examination or for which work has been prepared. The decision of the Head of Department and Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies regarding the linguistic competence of the translator appointed should be treated as final, subject to the provisions for reconsideration of the final grade.It is suggested that the translator should correct any errors of spelling and grammar on the photocopy of an assignment in M\u0101ori with a brief report to the course convenor and the student regarding the quality and clarity of the M\u0101ori used by the student.Where a candidate has given notice in writing of the intention to present material in Te Reo M\u0101ori, he or she should be informed by the Head of Department as soon as is reasonably possible whether or not the assessment will be based on translation.The University should do its best to make the results of an item of course work or an examination presented in Te Reo M\u0101ori available to the candidate within the normal time-frame. The process of assessment in such cases, particularly if it includes translation, may result in delays in the return of course work or in the publication of results.If the course work and/or examination script is to be subject to external assessment and translation is required, the Head of Department, in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, should appoint the translator.When coursework or an examination script is returned to a student, any translation used should also be returned.When oral work is assessable, the same principles should apply as for written work. However, practicalities may necessitate more restrictive policy details, such as a limitation on the use of Te Reo M\u0101ori where oral work involves interaction with other candidates who do not understand Te Reo M\u0101ori.Any complaint about a decision regarding linguistic or subject competence made under the provisions of paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 shall be through the appropriate procedures such as via the Head of Department, Academic Dean of a Division, Pro Vice-Chancellor or in some cases, Student Experience, Shared Services. In such cases the University's Academic Grievance Procedures should be consulted.\nPromotion of M\u0101ori Culture\nThe University acknowledges Ng\u0101i Tahu as the mana whenua of its two South Island campuses. It also acknowledges as tangata whenua Ng\u0101ti Toa and Te \u0101ti Awa at the Wellington campus and Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua at the Auckland campus. These iwi are the arbiters of cultural practices on their campuses. Senate will consult with the Treaty of Waitangi Committee on relevant matters of cultural practice involving the University. By including M\u0101ori cultural practices in University activities, not only will the institution be acknowledging the bicultural nature of New Zealand, but it will also be making the University a more friendly place for M\u0101ori staff and students.\nEvery language is tied closely to the culture of the people who speak it. The University supports the use of appropriate M\u0101ori cultural practices. Situations where these procedures could be used include:\nthe welcoming of visitors, especially when they include M\u0101ori;interviewing prospective employees, especially when they are M\u0101ori;the opening of new buildings; andmeetings and conferences\nTraining in how to use Te Reo M\u0101ori in such situations is offered through HEDC. The University's M\u0101ori Affairs Adviser is also available for advice on M\u0101ori cultural practices.\n\nFootnotes\nFishman, J.A. 1980.

        "scope": "This policy applies to the whole University.",
        "content": "PreliminariesIt is important: to ensure that the University enters into strategically appropriate arrangements with approved partners/institutions only, in accordance with University academic policies and standards,that its actions conform to the requirements of CUAP, andthat its actions conform to the requirements of the Tertiary Education Commission.Nature of inter-institutional collaborationsIn all cases it is necessary for a formal agreement to be in place between Otago and the other institution. A co-educational agreement will be required in all cases where another institution is actively involved in the teaching of at least one paper and/or programme which will lead to an award of this University. More complex collaborations will require more detailed agreements.The Planning and Funding Office of the University provides guidelines on the Tertiary Education Commission requirements in respect of partnership arrangements.Principles and fundamental requirementsIt is expected that any co-educational agreement made between the University of Otago and another partner will conform to the following principles.Principles of partnership The University will collaborate with educational institutions of standing, approved by Senate on a case by case basis, to deliver academic papers and/or programmes that meet the standard set and expected by all students admitted to the University.The University will support articulation arrangements with institutions of appropriate quality.The University of Otago retains control over programmes offered in its name.University of Otago papers and programmes are subject to University of Otago quality assurance processes, assessment policies, teaching and learning polices, are taught by persons approved by the University of Otago, and are subject to academic directions set by the University of Otago.The University will not regard as its own those papers and programmes of study offered and taught by a partner institution.Academic requirements of partnership Where a programme of study offered by another institution leads to a University of Otago qualification, it must be of a standard and quality equivalent to that offered by the University itself. The University will ensure the equivalence of the standards and quality through the use of its internal quality assurance processes.Where an Otago programme of study is offered by another institution the University will require evidence that it can be, is being, and continues to be delivered at a standard and quality equivalent to that offered by the University itself. The University will establish monitoring processes to ensure that this is the case.Other requirements of partnership Proposals for partnership programmes must demonstrate relevance to the University's strategic goals and objectives, and must be seen to enhance the University's reputation nationally and internationally.All partnership proposals must comply with national codes and legislation, and all relevant regulatory requirements affecting both the University and the partner. This includes CUAP and NZQA approval and accreditation processes.All partnership proposals must conform to the procedures established for academic proposals within the University, and meet the same criteria for approval.All partnership proposals must conform to the relevant requirements of the Tertiary Education Commission, as confirmed by the Planning and Funding Office.All partnership proposals must outline the arrangements for claiming funding and student fees and any other payments, and these must be consistent with the relevant University requirements.ProcessThe process to be followed for the establishment of a co-educational partnership agreement is identical to that for any proposal for a new paper or programme, with the addition of an initial stage.Before an academic proposal is submitted a report should be written on the following matters. In relation to the partner(s) The academic credibility of the proposed partner.The financial viability of the proposed partner.Student support and welfare and grievance/dispute resolution procedures available in the partner institution.In relation to the partnership The management structures and roles and responsibilities of all partners.Costing and fee details including fee split, management fees or royalty payment, responsibility for covering expenses/loss etc. (All direct and indirect and overhead costs must normally be covered by revenue from the programme.)Responsibility for marketing, advertising etc., including the use of logos (i.e. joint badging for marketing purposes).The extent to which Otago University academic and/or general staff will or will not provide support to students enrolled at the partner institution.Whether or not teaching staff at the partner institution are to be regarded as Otago University staff.Ways that University and third party intellectual property will be protected to ensure that all copyright issues have been addressed.Arrangements where appropriate to charge third party licence provisions especially those relating to Library and/or IT resources.The Quality Assurance and risk management processes to be applied during the term of the relationship with a partner, including a predefined review period and a termination clause.A plan indicating at what stage students will be admitted and enrolled at the University. (In some cases, students may be admitted and enrolled at the partner institution on the understanding that credit will be given toward the University of Otago degree. This is an articulation arrangement.)The status of the partnership with regard to Tertiary Education Commission requirements.On receipt of this report the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) will or will not recommend that an academic proposal be submitted.An academic proposal will be submitted in accordance with the normal Approval Process for New Programmes, New Papers, and Amendments to Regulations and Prescriptions. Proposals must have the appropriate sign-off on internal resource issues including appropriate consultation and agreement with the Library, ITS, and other service areas. Once the proposal has the approval of the appropriate Divisional Board, it should be forwarded to the Academic Committee as appropriate for consideration.Following academic approval by the Senate, a formal co-educational agreement can be prepared for the Vice-Chancellor to sign.The agreement must be signed by all the parties concerned before the initiative can proceed to implementation.",

The section titled \"The process to be followed for the establishment of a co-educational partnership agreement is identical to that for any proposal for a new paper or programme, with the addition of an initial stage.\" seems to be redundant as it does not add much new information compared to other parts of the policy.\n\nOverall, while the policy provides important guidelines and requirements for partnership arrangements, some sections seem to be redundant or repetitive.",

        "name": "Study_Assistance_Policy_for_Staff_Members_enrolling_in_Tertiary_Study",
        "scope": "This policy applies University-wide.",
        "content": "1. Overview\nWhere the conditions of employment specify conditions for the granting of study leave and the payment of fees, these should be adhered to. In all other cases, including grant funded staff, the following policy shall apply: Members of staff whose employment is half-time or more, and who have a minimum contract of 10 months, may apply for Study Assistance except for staff enrolling in a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) or Master of Business Administration (MBA) programmes who must be permanent and full-time. Staff who do not have permanent resident status, and enrol in courses for which they are required to pay full cost fees, will not normally be eligible for Study Assistance.Recommendations for study assistance must be approved by a Study Assistance Approver.A member of staff whose application for Study Assistance has been declined may request a review of the decision by the Director of Human Resources.Members of staff will not normally be eligible for study assistance in respect of more than one paper per semester. In the case of study assistance for distance learning, up to four modules/papers may be undertaken per year.Members of staff who enrol for interest only are not eligible for study assistance, unless they do not have a University degree or equivalent tertiary qualification, and where possible, or practicable, this study will be undertaken at the University of Otago.\n2. Fees and Expenses\nFees and Expenses Where study is a condition of employment, and specified as such in the letter of appointment, full tuition fees and expenses may be granted. Where members of staff have been required to undertake study subsequent to their appointment the application for a 100 per cent grant must be accompanied by a letter from the Study Assistance Approver, which confirms that the applicant is required to undertake study.Where study is work related but is desirable rather than essential, 70 per cent of the tuition fee and expenses may be granted.Applications for Study Assistance relating to external tertiary providers will only be considered if the chosen course of study is not available through the University of Otago.Where an application to study papers for the Postgraduate Certificate, Diploma or Master in Higher Education is approved the grant will automatically be 100 percent and will be fully funded by the department.Applications for non-work-related study may receive a grant of 25 per cent of the appropriate fee provided that the applicant does not already possess a University degree or an equivalent tertiary qualification and, where possible and practicable, is undertaking this study at the University of Otago.Staff are automatically exempted from paying the Student Services Fee. This fee must not be included in Study Assistance grants.M\u0101ori Studies and M\u0101ori Language papers Given the University\u2019s commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the M\u0101ori Strategic Framework, HODs, Divisional Heads, and Deans are encouraged to support staff who wish to study 100-level papers in M\u0101ori Studies, and M\u0101ori language papers at all levels.Where an application to study M\u0101ori Language papers is approved, the grant will be 100 percent of the appropriate fee (30 percent of that will be funded by the Office of M\u0101ori Development).Where an application to study 100-level M\u0101ori Studies papers other than the language papers is approved, the grant will be 70 percent of the appropriate fee.Staff who do not normally meet domestic student status requirements, but do hold a permanent academic or professional staff role, are eligible to apply for Study Assistance at the domestic fee rate for M\u0101ori Studies papers delivered by the University.Fees and Expenses Limits A limit, reviewed annually and found in the administrative procedures on the application form, applies to all study assistance fees and expenses, with the exception of postgraduate courses in Health Sciences. Under exceptional circumstances, the Study Assistance Approver may approve a grant over the limit.Failure to pass papers An application for Study Assistance will not normally be approved where an applicant has failed to pass a paper in a previous year.\n3. Leave to Attend Classes\nStaff who are eligible for Study Assistance under 2(a)(i) may be granted up to two hours' leave per week to attend classes.Staff who are eligible for Study Assistance under 2(a) or 2(b) may be granted leave to attend classes as follows: Full-time member of staff: two hours' leave per week.Less than full-time member of staff: one hours' leave per week.Where necessary, leave in excess of the above allowances may be granted but the time must be made up.All staff who are eligible for Study Assistance under either 2(a) or 2(b) will, where practicable, be granted paid leave to attend block courses. Leave to attend block courses must be requested at the time of the application for study assistance.\n4. Guidelines for the Interpretation of the Study Assistance Policy\nStaff on leave without pay are not normally entitled to study assistance. However, in cases where staff commence leave without pay during a course of study for which they have previously been granted study assistance, the Study Assistance Approver may provide an exemption from this rule.Where the staff member's contract is due to expire during the proposed course of study, but their Manager/HOD is reasonably confident that a further contract will be offered, they may submit a recommendation for Study Assistance to the Study Assistance Approver.Any approval for MBA or DBA study (both internal and external) will require an undertaking from the staff member to repay any financial support pro rata should they leave the University's employment within three years of completing each course of study for which fees support has been given.Grants of 100 per cent for fees and expenses should be rare, and confined only to cases where study has been made a condition of employment in the letter of appointment, or subsequently required by the employer for the benefit of the University, e.g. to assist a department to meet Health and Safety requirements. Academic staff completing a PhD should receive a 100 per cent subsidy only if completion of the PhD was part of the job contract or a confirmation path objective.When considering whether study is work related or not the value of the degree or qualification as a whole should be considered rather than individual papers. Regardless, the particular papers chosen by the staff member must always meet with the approval of the Study Assistance Approver.The 25 per cent fee subsidy is intended to encourage staff members who have little or no experience of study at degree level to develop their potential, and their career within the University.The term \u201cexpenses\u201d relates to the cost of attending block courses for staff undertaking external study, e.g., travel expenses. All expenses must adhere to University financial policies. Heads of Department are encouraged to support their staff to attend block courses.Only in exceptional circumstances should staff be permitted to enrol in more than one paper per semester. Staff who are part time may choose to study more than one paper per semester in their own time, but will not be eligible to receive Study Assistance for the additional papers.HODs must ensure that staff who are studying have adequate breaks, and that the additional workload imposed by study is manageable and reasonable.For staff applying for distance study, the normal expectation is that any study undertaken will be completed within four years.",

Discussion of authorship can be found in the following:\n Responsible Practice in Research \u2013 Code of ConductGuidelines for Graduate Research SupervisorsAllegations of Misconduct in Research Procedures ",
        "content": "1. Intent\nThe University understands and acknowledges that the IP of graduate research students is underpinned by different circumstances, factors and relationships to the IP of staff. Generally speaking, the IP of graduate research students is created during, and directly related to, the course of their supervised research studies, while the IP of staff is created during the course of their employment at the University.\nTo protect the interests of both parties, it is essential for the student and the University, in partnership, to develop an appropriate Intellectual Property Agreement (IPA) that includes specific detail around University and student ownership of the IP, and which is tailored to the particular circumstances of the IP that the student has created or anticipates creating.\nThe University's view is that IP is produced with the assistance of the University through its staff and other resources, and the University accordingly has part-ownership of the IP. When the University does wish to exercise a claim on ownership of IP, it will enter into an agreement with the respective student, in accordance with this policy, to share the financial benefits that may arise. Should the University waive ownership, the student is free to make their own arrangements regarding the IP.\nStudents who are also staff, and whose staff roles do not include a research component, will be considered as students and this policy will apply \u2013 provided the IP in question has been created through their graduate research studies. The University of Otago Intellectual Property Rights Policy (for staff) will apply to those students who are also members of the academic staff and whose staff roles include a bona fide research component.\nWhere students are employed by a third (external) party within a research collaboration, the covering IPA must include specific detail around University, student and third party ownership of the IP.\nWhen using IP created by a graduate research student, a supervisor must declare both the supervisor's and the student's respective roles in creating the IP, particularly as these pertain to inventorship. A supervisor may not commercially exploit the IP created with a student without the express written agreement of both the student and the University.\n2. Copyright\nThe University does not claim copyright in work or material produced by students during, and directly related to, their course of studies and agrees that copyright in such work or material is owned by the students who produce it.\n3. Procedures\nThe following procedures facilitate the creation and protection of commercially valuable IP:\nGraduate research students are required to sign an IP declaration when enrolling as thesis students in eVision. This declaration is included together with the other declarations in the Consent and Declaration page in eVision. The declaration reads as follows, under the heading \u201cIntellectual Property Rights (for thesis students)\u201d: \u201cI undertake to abide by the University's Policy for Intellectual Property Rights of Graduate Research Students.\u201dWhen research activity generates or is likely to generate results that are novel and have potential commercial applicability, students should immediately advise the Director, Research and Enterprise, through their Head of Department. The Director, Research and Enterprise will make an assessment of commercial applicability, and, where appropriate, will initiate formal procedures to develop a mutually agreeable IPA, covering (among other things) the respective student and University ownership proportions of the IP and the term of the IPA. Any costs involved will be paid by the University in the first instance but will be recovered subsequently pursuant to section 4 below. Should no remuneration eventuate, the University will bear these costs.Any IP or idea or specific knowledge with potential commercial applicability that is already in existence at the commencement of the student's studies should be appropriately identified and registered in a statement of prior IP in the IPA. The purpose of this statement is to: accurately identify, and hence appropriately protect, any relevant IP the graduate research students is bringing with them to the research project; and/oridentify and protect the student's contribution in the creation of any subsequent IP so as to minimise the possibility of any conflicts of interest arising. When enrolling in eVision, graduate research students are also required to indicate whether or not they are bringing relevant IP to a research project. There is provision within eVision to upload a statement outlining any such IP.To safeguard any IP created within the University, it is important that students are cautious about publically sharing the results of research activity with potential commercial applicability so as to avoid inadvertent disclosure. (Inadvertent disclosure may occur via seminars, public talks, conference proceedings, posters, published articles, social media and so on.) It is in the best interests of the student and the University to not publicise the results of their research until the Director, Research and Enterprise has made a final assessment on commercial applicability and protection of any IP that may arise from the research activity. This decision shall be made expeditiously, so that publication or dissemination of the student's work is not unreasonably delayed.Students are advised to maintain full records of all documentation related to the creation of IP and to keep the University informed of their contact details.\n4. Distribution of income from intellectual property\nAny royalties or other remuneration received by the University as a consequence of licensing, selling, or otherwise dealing with IP which the University claims part-ownership of pursuant to this policy, shall be distributed in a manner consistent with this policy and the IPA entered into with the student (section 3(b)) \u2013 incorporating, where applicable, any associated statement of prior IP (section 3(c)).\nAs a general principle, the following distribution model will be used in determining the respective shares of the parties:\nFirstly, the University and the student shall recover the following expenses incurred in the protection and/or commercialisation of the IP.Secondly, the balance of the royalties or other remuneration shall then be divided between the student and the University based upon the percentage contribution of the student in creating the IP. This percentage contribution will be determined through a process of consultation and mediation between the student and the University, including the student's supervisor(s), with a view to reaching an agreement. It is the University's intent that the percentage contribution should represent an accurate, mutually agreeable, fair and reasonable figure. If required, an appropriate third party, agreeable to by the student and the University, may be requested to independently assess the relative value of contributions by the student and the University and to make a final and binding decision.The University's share of the royalties and other remuneration will be divided in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Policy.\n5. Cessation of study\nWhen a student who is entitled to payments pursuant to section 4(b) leaves the University upon completion of their studies, or dies while studying at the University, the payments will continue either to the student in the case of the former or to their estate in the case of the latter.\n6. Redress\nAny complaints related to the application of this policy, including the apportionment of income from the IP, should be made in writing to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise).Complaints will be addressed in accordance with the relevant redress provisions in the respective IPA.\n7. External Research Contracts\nThe University may enter into contracts to provide research resources to external clients, including those in the commercial sector. Ownership of IP generated by such research, and distribution of income from that IP will be governed by the terms of the contracts, and sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 above will not apply.Students engaged in such contract research must: be fully informed in writing of the IP provisions that have been arranged;give their consent in writing to these arrangements prior to beginning their research; andcomply with all contract terms and conditions, including any confidentiality requirements and publication constraints.The University's \u201cExternally Sponsored Graduate Research Procedures\u201d should be consulted when study based on externally funded research is contemplated.",

Education services at tertiary level are not considered regulated services, and so teaching interactions with enrolled students aged 17 years or younger will not normally fall under the definition of relevant child contact, except where such teaching is carried out on behalf of a school or other regulated service.Any staff member who is likely to have relevant child contact in the context of their University employment shall be safety checked.Any student who has, or is likely to have, relevant child contact as a consequence of their enrolment in University programme(s) or paper(s), or as a consequence of any other official University activities, shall be safety checked.\u00a0\u00a0Child contact independent of University activities (e.g. through existing independent employment) does not require University safety checking.Safety checks shall be carried out as prescribed under the Vulnerable Children (Requirements for Safety Checks of Children's Workers) Regulations 2015.Safety checks shall occur: before the staff member or student commences work with children (or before deadline dates as specified under commencement provisions in clauses 25 and 26 of the Children's Act 2014), and subsequentlyat least every three years if the staff member or student is continuing in a University role which involves child contact.The University may accept, as meeting the requirement of clauses 2(d), written confirmation of a dated safety check concluding that a person is safe to work with children from: District Health Boards (DHBs), for staff or students who are currently employed by the DHB and for whom relevant child contact in their University work or study is primarily or solely within the context of the DHB, orany other organisation (including registering bodies), for staff or students for whom relevant child contact in their University work or study shall occur solely within the context of that other organisation. Such safety checks only apply to work in the specified contexts. Relevant child contact outside these contexts shall require a University-initiated safety check.The University shall endeavour to make clear to prospective staff, students and other University representatives, employment and study options, or other University business, which require safety checking, for example through position descriptions and recruitment processes, and programme and paper regulations and notes.The University reserves the right to require a full or partial safety check of any staff member, student or other University representative who has relevant child contact in the context of their University work or study, regardless of any previous checks carried out.The University reserves the right to appropriately restrict a person's University-based activities where a safety check finds that that person may pose a risk to children and/or is not permitted to work with children under the Children's Act 2014, or where no safety check has been completed.Nothing in this clause shall limit the University's obligation and right to take all necessary steps to meet legislative requirements.Safety Checking Oversight and ResponsibilitiesSafety checks shall be carried out by: Human Resources in relation to staff, andthe relevant academic department or division in relation to students.Departments, in consultation with Human Resources, are responsible for identifying University roles involving relevant child contact, and in such cases ensuring appropriate safety checking is carried out.Human Resources shall maintain records of staff safety checks, and advise departments which rechecking (under clause 2(e)ii) may be required.Academic departments and divisions are responsible for: identifying programmes and papers under their jurisdiction (excluding research-only programmes and papers) which may involve relevant child contact, and reporting this to: \u00b7 the Academic Committee, through standard proposal or amendment processes, for new or amended programmes or papers, or \u00b7 the Manager, Policy and Compliance, for existing programmes or papersappropriately accounting for safety checking requirements in programme and paper regulations and notes, andensuring compliant safety checking and rechecking processes are in place for such papers and programmes and are carried out as required.Staff researchers, and supervisors of research students, are responsible for: reporting planned relevant child contact in research projects under their jurisdiction to their Head of Department and the appropriate University of Otago Human Ethics Committee as part of the ethical approval process for those projects, andorganising any associated safety checks that are required in accordance with clause 3(a).",

However, having separate procedures (mentioned in q2_response) that provide more detailed information on how to implement this policy could be considered redundant. If these procedures contain cross-references to other policies, they should be included in the JSON data or referenced accordingly.\n\n2. **Lack of hierarchy**: The policy document does not explicitly state which sections supersede others or have priority. This lack of hierarchy might lead to ambiguity and confusion when implementing the policy. It would be beneficial to include a clear section that outlines the order of precedence, if necessary.\n\n3. **Inconsistent terminology**: The policy uses both \"principles\" and \"rules.\" While not necessarily incorrect, using consistent terminology throughout the document would improve its clarity and coherence.\n\n4. **No clear definitions for key terms**: The policy uses terms like \"sensitive expenditure,\" \"probity,\" and \"impartiality.\" Providing clear definitions for these terms, especially in a policy document, is essential to ensure understanding and compliance.\n\n5. **No version control or revision history**: There is no indication of when the policy was last updated or revised. Including this information would help track changes and provide transparency into the evolution of the policy.\n\n6. **No clear contact information for inquiries or appeals**: The policy does not specify who to contact if someone has questions about the policy, wants to appeal a decision, or needs clarification on any aspect of the document. Providing this information would improve user experience and facilitate compliance.\n\n7. **Lack of audit trail or monitoring process**: While the policy mentions that transactions are monitored regularly by Financial Services Division, it does not provide details on how often these checks occur, who is responsible for conducting them, or what steps are taken if non-compliance is detected. Including this information would enhance transparency and accountability.\n\n8. **Unclear scope of applicability**: The policy states that it applies to \"all University staff or individuals\" but does not specify which departments, faculties, or units are exempt from its provisions. Clarifying the scope of applicability would prevent confusion and ensure compliance.\n\n9. **No clear guidelines for escalation or review processes**: The policy mentions that breaches will be reported to the Vice-Chancellor, but it does not provide details on how appeals or escalation procedures work. Including these guidelines would improve the overall effectiveness of the policy and promote a culture of compliance.\n\n10. **No provision for ongoing education or training**: The policy assumes that stakeholders are familiar with its contents and principles. Providing opportunities for education and training on the policy, as well as its associated guidelines and procedures, would enhance understanding and compliance."

Exemptions\nEmergency work: The University acknowledges that some emergency work may require contractors that are unapproved. Emergency work might include where there is an immediate or imminent and serious risk to people or property, such as fire, flood, electricity failure and earthquake. In such cases, contractors may work on campus.Non-emergency work: in some cases, unapproved contractors, may be exempted from the Health and Safety approval process if the following requirements are met prior to working on campus: Written permission is obtained from (or their delegates): The Director, Health, Safety and Wellbeing; orThe Director of PSD; orThe Manager \u2013 Construction Health and Safety; andThe person giving permission is provided with: Details of the work to be done, including a risk assessment, SSSP, JSA or similar.Full names and contact details of the contractor and its workers for the job; andThe work is for short duration (less than three days).In some instances, the following might also be required: A written undertaking that the work will be supervised either by PSD staff or by an approved contractor managing the site to be worked on.A copy of relevant insurance policies.\n3.

Exemptions\" in the 'Health_and_Safety_Approved_Contractors_Policy' contains cross-references to other policies (Contractor Health and Safety Approval Process Guidelines). While these guidelines are referenced, it would be better to include their content or a summary within this policy document itself to avoid future cross-referencing issues.\n\n2. **Inconsistent naming conventions**: The 'Capital Works Projects' section uses the phrase \"Principal Contractors,\" while in other parts of the document, it's referred to as \"Contractors.\" Consistent naming conventions would improve clarity and readability.\n\n3. **Overlapping content**: Some sections seem redundant or overlap with existing policies. For example, the requirement for contractors to obtain written permission from certain directors (Director, Health, Safety and Wellbeing; Director of PSD; Manager \u2013 Construction Health and Safety) seems similar to the process described in the Contractor Health and Safety Approval Process Guidelines.\n\n4. **Unclear procedure boundaries**: The 'Health_and_Safety_Approved_Contractors_Policy' and 'Contractor Health and Safety Approval Process Guidelines' seem closely related, with the guidelines serving as a more detailed explanation of the approval process. It might be beneficial to merge these into one document or clarify their relationship further.\n\n5. **Potential duplication**: The section \"2. Exemptions\" appears to list specific scenarios where unapproved contractors may be exempt from the Health and Safety approval process. However, it seems that these exemptions are already covered by the broader Contractor Health and Safety Approval Process Guidelines. Duplicate information should be removed or consolidated.\n\n6. **Missing context for procedures**: While the 'Health_and_Safety_Approved_Contractors_Policy' contains relevant procedures (e.g., obtaining written permission), it would be helpful to provide more context about these procedures, such as what they entail or how they are implemented.\n\n7. **Lack of clarity on scope**: The policy document does not explicitly state its effective date, review cycle, or any updates to the document itself. Adding this information would improve transparency and facilitate future updates.\n\n8. **No clear decision-making authority**: It's unclear who is responsible for making decisions regarding exemptions, approving contractors, or enforcing policies within the organization. Clarifying this authority would help ensure consistency and efficiency in policy implementation.\n\nThese suggestions aim to clarify, simplify, and standardize the policy structure, reducing potential redundancy and inconsistencies."

        "name": "Pacific_Gifting_Policy_Procedure_and_Guidelines",
        "scope": "This is a University-wide policy that applies to all staff/students representing the University in Pacific cultural contexts within New Zealand and the wider Pacific region. The Policy does not apply to gifts given by the University to University employees.",
        "content": "Procedure for determining University representation at Pacific cultural gatherings where gifting may be appropriate (funerals, fono, etc.)Gifting is an integral part of many Pacific cultures and occupies a position similar to that of koha with M\u0101ori culture. Gifting occurs in a number of contexts, including interactions with/between Pacific individuals, churches, groups, organisations, and communities. Gifting is understood and practised as a reciprocal gesture (money, vouchers or payment in kind) whereby an unconditional gift is bestowed upon a recipient who has neither stipulated that it be given, nor has any expectation of receiving it. Reciprocity and unconditionality are implicit in Pacific gifting.Where staff or students are planning to attend a Pacific cultural gathering at which they consider University representation may be appropriate, they should notify their Manager/Supervisor/Head of Department before attending the event.In considering whether University representation is appropriate, the Manager/Supervisor/Head of Department shall consider the importance of the event to the University. In the case of a funeral, they may consider with respect to the deceased significance and/or prominence within the community;prominence and/or standing in the local or national tertiary sector; and/orassociation with the University of Otago.If the University is to be formally represented, consideration shall be given to the level of staff and/or students who should attend. In some cases senior University representation (i.e. Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, etc.) will be required.If there is difficulty determining the standing, and significance to the University, of the gathering, or the appropriate level of representation, advice should be sought from Divisional Pacific Leaders and/or the Pacific Development Office.If it is deemed that attendance by staff and/or students will be in a personal capacity, then any gift will be the responsibility of the staff/students concerned.Other circumstances where gifting may be appropriateGifts, as defined in clauses 4 and 5, may be given to external Pacific non-profit community groups and individuals (non-University employees) in certain circumstances. This may include acknowledging a Pacific individual, family or non-profit community group who: support/lead a University welcome or farewell, or the opening or closing of a conference or fono;directly support University research projects (through the provision of culture-specific knowledge and/or ethnicity-specific data);directly support University teaching and learning (through the provision of culture-specific knowledge, including hosting students on cultural immersion programmes);give support at a University-organised event such as the opening and/or blessing of a new building;participate where prominent Pacific guests are welcomed by local Pacific communities at the request of the University of Otago.Receive and host the University as part of a University project such as a repatriation.Authorisation procedure for giftingNotification should be made by the staff member to their Manager/Supervisor prior to gifting, of the intention to provide a gift. The staff member will fill out a Sensitive Expenditure Gift Approval Form providing: brief explanation of the reason for the gift; andthe date of the event;details of who the gift will be made to;details of the nature/amount of the proposed gift (i.e. whether cash, voucher or in-kind gift).The Manager/Supervisor will then make a recommendation, for the presentation of a gift, to their Divisional Head who may approve the gift if it is consistent with this policy.In the cause of large projects which require gifting to multiple community groups, advice should be sought from the Pacific Development Office as to who should be gifted and the amount.Administration procedures for giftsCash giftsFollowing approval of the gift, as described above, the staff member should email Revenue Management, Finance Services, a copy of documentation as detailed in 3(a), along with the authorisation of their Divisional Head.Revenue Management, Finance Services will arrange for the cash to be collected.In accordance with the Purchase Card Policy and Purchase Card Procedure, under certain circumstances the Purchase Card cash advance facility can be used for Pacific Gifting and Koha. This option can only be used after the gifting has been authorised through the process referred to in Clause 3. Ratification of this transaction will be the responsibility of the Pacific Development Office requiring evidence of the appropriate documentation.Non-cash gifts (vouchers, in-kind gifts, etc.)Following approval of the gift, as described above, the staff member should email Revenue Management, Finance Services a copy of documentation as detailed in 3(a), along with the authorisation of their Divisional Head.Revenue Management, Finance Services will arrange for a purchase order to be completed for the purchase of the gift.If Purchase Cards are used to purchase gifts or vouchers, receipting of the purchase will be accordance with the Purchase Card Procedure.All payments determined as gifting under this policy will not be liable for FBT or PAYE .Recommended amounts for giftsWhile limitations are essential, a degree of flexibility is retained so gifting can occur in a way that appropriately recognises the status of the relationship being acknowledged through the gift.Pacific cultural gatherings, non-profit community groups, families and individuals Gifts made by University of Otago representatives at Pacific cultural gatherings would normally range from NZ$50 to NZ$300 in value, and would typically comprise food, vouchers (food or petrol), or an appropriate gift (books, for example).FuneralsGifts for funerals would normally range from NZ$50 to NZ$300 in value. The gift would comprise a cash component (which is culturally appropriate across the Pacific region), and might also include a gift of food, or food vouchers, or flowers.ExceptionsFor events at which the University is represented by a senior management delegation (State funerals for example), an appropriate gift would be provided under the advisement of the Director, Pacific Development Office.For periods of extended engagement with non-profit Pacific community groups and individuals in Aotearoa New Zealand and the Pacific Islands (for research, in particular), gifting amounts would be itemised and approved as part of the research budget proposal.For events at which members of the University are hosted by multiple community groups and requires multiple gifts, an appropriate gifting plan would be provided under advisement from the Director, Pacific Development Office.Further Advice on University Representation and GiftingIf there are any issues in determining the level of representation or an appropriate gift for a situation, further advice should be sought from Divisional Pacific Leaders and/or the Director, Pacific Development Office.",

The classifications are:\n\n\nOver-funded \u2013 where the budget is greater than 115 per cent of income   earned\n\nNeutral \u2013 where the budget is between 85 per cent and 115 per cent of income earned\n\nUnder-funded \u2013 where the budget is less than 85 per cent of income earned\n\nWhile there is no requirement that funding allocations will be adjusted according to the classification of each Cost Centre, it is expected that divisions will adjust budgets where possible to move Cost Centres to a neutral classification.\nFiscal constraints\nThe budget will at all times be subject to the fiscal strategy approved by University Council and included in the annual Statement of Objectives provided to the Ministry of Education subsequent to the requirements of the Education and Training Act 2020 and the Public Finance Act.\nTiming\nThe budget is prepared from July to October for the following year with a budget review in April/May of the budget year.\nThe objectives of the budget review are:\n\nReview the Service Division and Central Committee budgets\nReview the funding allocations to Academic Divisions\nRecalculate University income based on actual EFTS enrolments at 31 March plus an estimate of second semester enrolments;\nCorrect major errors or omissions\nAdjust for major timing differences\nReview for any new or discontinued initiatives\n\nBudget approval\nThe Budget and the Budget Review will be approved by Finance & Budget Committee and Council.",

Principles and fundamental requirements\nIt is expected that any agreement made between the University of Otago and an international partner will conform to the following principles.\nPrinciples of partnership The University of Otago will collaborate with international partner institutions, approved by Senate (except for Agent Agreements) to achieve strategic priorities, in a manner that meets the standards set and expected by the students and staff of the University of Otago.The University of Otago will support partnerships agreements with institutions on a case by case basis.The University of Otago retains control over programmes offered in its name.University of Otago's papers and programmes are subject to quality assurance processes, assessment policies, teaching and learning polices, are taught by persons approved by the University of Otago and are subject to academic directions set by the University of Otago.The University of Otago will not regard as its own those papers and programmes of study offered and taught by a partner institution.Any international partnership arrangement requires the University of Otago to fulfil its obligations under the Education (Pastoral Care of Tertiary and International Learners) Code of Practice, for all enrolled students paying international fees.Academic requirements of an international agreement, including articulation agreements. Where a programme of study offered by another institution leads to a University of Otago qualification, it must be of a standard and quality equivalent to that offered by the University itself. The University of Otago will ensure the equivalence of the standards and quality, via its usual internal quality assurance processes and any other monitoring process that may be required.Where a University of Otago programme of study is offered by another institution, the University will require evidence that it can be, is being, and continues to be delivered at a standard and quality equivalent to that offered by the University of Otago itself. The University of Otago will establish monitoring processes to ensure that this is the case.Other requirements of partnership Proposals for partnership arrangements must demonstrate relevance to the University of Otago's strategic goals and objectives and must be seen to enhance the University of Otago's reputation nationally and internationally.All partnership proposals must comply with national codes and legislation, and all relevant regulatory requirements affecting both the University of Otago and the partner organisation. This includes CUAP approval, NZQA requirements and any other relevant, external accreditation processes.All partnership proposals must conform to the procedures established within the University of Otago at all levels and meet the same criteria for approval.All partnership proposals must conform to the relevant requirements of the TEC .All partnership proposals, involving the admission and enrolment of international students, must outline the arrangements for claiming funding and student fees and any other payments, and these must be consistent with the relevant University of Otago requirements.\n4. Process\nThe process to establish and formalise a new/renew an international partnership agreement is similar for all formal agreement types, except Letters of Intent (which may simply be requested and approved, signed by the Director International or nominee).\nThe staff member proposing the new partnership arrangement will complete the appropriate proposal form, andThe individual proposal form will be completed as required. In relation to the partner(s), consideration is given to the following: The academic credibility of the proposed partner.The financial viability of the proposed partner.Student support and welfare, andgrievance/dispute resolution procedures available in the partner institution.In relation to the partnership, consideration is given to the following and will be reflected in the resultant formal written agreement, where applicable: The management structures and roles and responsibilities of all partners.Costing and fee details including fee split, management fees or royalty payment, responsibility for covering expenses/loss etc. (All direct and indirect and overhead costs must normally be covered by revenue from the programme.)Responsibility for marketing, advertising etc., including the use of logos (i.e. joint badging for marketing purposes).The extent to which the University of Otago academic and/or professional staff will or will not provide support to students enrolled at the partner institution.Whether or not teaching staff at the partner institution are to be regarded as University of Otago staff.Ways in which University of Otago and third-party intellectual property will be protected to ensure that all copyright issues have been addressed.Arrangements where appropriate to charge third party licence provisions especially those relating to Library and/or IT resources.The quality assurance and risk management processes to be applied during the term of the relationship with a partner, including a predefined review period and a termination clause.A plan indicating at what stage students will be admitted and enrolled at the University of Otago. (In some cases, students may be admitted and enrolled at the partner institution on the understanding that credit will be given toward the University of Otago degree. This is an articulation arrangement.)The status of the partnership regarding any relevant TEC requirements.Partnership Proposals will be subject to Divisional committee approval processes before being submitted to the University's Internationalisation Committee for recommendation to Senate.With regard to Articulation Agreements: A proposal for a new Articulation Agreement must have the support of the appropriate Divisional Board and/or approval of the Pro Vice-Chancellor. Furthermore, should the Pro Vice-Chancellor or Internationalisation Committee require, the proposal may be forwarded to the Academic Committee for further consideration.Once established, all Articulation Agreements will undergo regular review. A process, similar to that of the Annual Progress Reports for new papers/programmes, will be applied as a measure of a quality control. Furthermore, articulation agreements should be reviewed whenever there is significant change by either institution. However, minor changes, e.g. a change in paper title, may simply be updated in Schedule 1 of the Agreement and communicated accordingly between the partners. The International Office should be advised whenever there is a change to an Agreement.Articulation Agreements may be formed for an Undergraduate or Postgraduate programme, with adherence to the rules and regulations of the University of Otago.The wording of a new partnership agreement is developed through negotiation with the partner(s).Following approval of the Proposal by Council, the formal partnership agreement will be prepared for the Vice-Chancellor (or delegated nominee) to sign, with support from relevant staff in the International Office. A similar approval process will be used for the signing of renewed or reviewed partnership agreements.The agreement must be signed by all the parties concerned, before the partnership is recognised and implemented. The process for obtaining signatures will have the oversight of the Internationalisation Committee.",
        "q1_response": "Based on the provided policy document, I have identified several policies that contain unnecessary content such as cross-references to other policies:\n\n1. 'Partnership_Arrangements_with_International_Institutions_Policy' contains a large amount of unnecessary detail about specific aspects of partnership agreements, such as the process for obtaining signatures and the oversight by the Internationalisation Committee. While these details are relevant, they could be extracted into separate policy documents or procedures.\n\n2. The 'Education (Pastoral Care of Tertiary and International Learners) Code of Practice' is mentioned several times in the document. However, this is a specific code of practice that may not be directly related to partnership agreements, and therefore could be considered unnecessary content for the current policy document.\n\n3. There are multiple references to 'the relevant requirements of the TEC', which appears to refer to the Tertiary Education Commission. While the TEC's regulations may be relevant to partnership agreements, these references could be consolidated into a separate policy document or procedure.\n\n4. The mention of 'CUAP approval' and 'NZQA requirements' is scattered throughout the document. Like the TEC's regulations, these are specific requirements that could be extracted into separate policy documents or procedures.\n\nIt is worth noting that this assessment assumes that the unnecessary content is not essential to the understanding of the current policy document, but rather serves as background information or procedural details that could be separated out.",

        "content": "Approval of Leave\nAny member of staff seeking leave to attend a conference or meeting must obtain approval from their Divisional Head (Deans in Health Sciences) on the recommendation of the Head of Department or Dean for the period of leave. Staff with clinical appointments must also obtain approval from the manager of their clinical service. Staff seeking Conference Leave will normally be expected to be taking an active part in the conference or meeting concerned, such as presenting a paper or poster, chairing a session or other designated function relating to the conference or the sponsoring organisation.Staff seeking Conference Leave will normally be expected to be taking an active part in the conference or meeting concerned, such as presenting a paper or poster, chairing a session or other designated function relating to the conference or the sponsoring organisation. This active participation can be in person, or online.Those approving Conference Leave must be satisfied that the following conditions have been considered: That attendance in person (rather than online) is necessary, given the climate change impact of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with travel.Where travel is deemed necessary, that opportunities to maximise the value of the travel have been fully explored to minimise the need for additional subsequent travel to the same location e.g. visits and relationship building beyond conference attendance.Where on-campus duties such as teaching are a barrier to combining other activities into one trip, that conducting those activities online has been adequately explored.Conference Leave can also be applied to support attendance of online conferences or meetings from campus or home. For example, where a conference is taking place in a European time zone, conference leave can be authorised to enable attendance at the conference without any expectation that staff will be working on other tasks during regular working hours.The approved period of leave will normally be for the period of attendance at the conference or meeting, together with the minimal reasonable period for travel to and from the University. Any leave in excess of this minimum requires the approval of the Divisional Head (Deans in Health Sciences may approve up to 10 working days leave of absence). For academic staff in confirmed or confirmation-track appointments, leave beyond this minimum period will normally be taken as Extended Conference Leave as defined in the University's Research and Study Leave policy.Staff may include a period of annual leave combined with conference leave, subject to the approval of the Pro Vice-Chancellor (Deans in Health Sciences may approve up to 10 days annual leave) upon recommendation of the Head of Department (and for clinical staff, that of their clinical service manager) and Dean.For joint clinical staff whose employment contracts make provision for continuing education leave, normally all conference leave will be accommodated within this provision.All leave in excess of two working weeks in a semester or examination period or any leave involving Extended Conference Leave, will require approval by the Divisional Head. Applications for approval of Conference Leave should normally be submitted to the head of department (and where relevant the clinical service manager) at least one month before the proposed departure date, and will normally state: name and venue of conference/meetingdates of conference (or proposed dates of attendance if different)proposed inclusive dates of absence from the Universitypurpose of attendance at the conference or meeting (presentation etc.)any outside financial support being provided if attendance is approved.Where an application for financial support is also being submitted (see below) the application must conform to Divisional/School/Departmental policy for such applications, and be submitted in accordance with closing dates set by the funding cost centre. Approval for leave does not guarantee funding support.\nAdditional Financial Support\nUniversity funds may be used to support the attendance of staff or students at conferences or meetings, where it is deemed that such attendance would advance the objectives of the University.Such support will be given as a refund of the actual and reasonable costs of attendance, less any outside financial assistance available, up to a specified ceiling amount.All claims for refunds must be fully supported by receipts, and be approved by the person holding the delegated authority for this purpose per University Financial Delegation Policy.The allocation of travel and sustenance grants for Conference Leave requires the approval of the head of the cost centre (Department or School) or,where the conference travel fund is held centrally, that of the Dean or Divisional Head. The Division, School or Department (at whichever level the conference leave fund is administered) will be expected to have set an annual budget for this purpose, and have explicit guidelines for application dates, criteria for allocating funds between applicants, and level of support to be granted.\nApplications\nPlease contact your Divisional office (the Department or School Office in the Division of Health Sciences) to obtain a conference leave application.",

However, it's worth noting that there are sometimes separate documents for procedures, rather than including them within the policy itself.\n\n3. **Potential overlap with another policy**: The scope of this policy seems to be already covered by the referenced 'Equal Employment Opportunities and Equal Educational Opportunities Policy'. If the goal is to ensure that all policies related to these topics are clearly understood and in line with each other, it might be beneficial to remove the reference from the scope section.\n\n4. **Cross-referencing**: While not necessarily incorrect, cross-referencing can sometimes make a policy document seem redundant or less self-contained than it needs to be. In this case, removing unnecessary cross-references (like the one in the scope) could improve clarity and coherence.\n\n5. **Lack of specificity**: The policy text does not include specific details about how Affirmative Action will be implemented, monitored, or reviewed. Including such specifics would help ensure that the policy is effectively implemented and provides concrete measures for achieving its goals.\n\n6. **Unclear definitions**: While the policy text includes a definition of Affirmative Action, it might be beneficial to clarify any other technical terms or jargon used in the document to ensure clarity and understanding across different stakeholders.\n\n7. **Potential inconsistencies with related policies**: Depending on how this policy is implemented and integrated into the broader organizational structure, there may be potential for inconsistencies with other related policies (e.g., those dealing with equality, diversity, and inclusion). Regular review of these policies to ensure they are aligned would be beneficial.\n\n8. **Lack of metrics or evaluation criteria**: Without clear metrics or evaluation criteria, it is challenging to assess the effectiveness of this policy in achieving its objectives. Developing such metrics would help determine whether the policy is successful in addressing its intended goals and inform future improvements.\n\n9. **Potential for confusion with related policies**: If other policies within the organization (e.g., those on diversity and inclusion) have similar language or scope, it may lead to confusion among employees about which policy applies in specific situations. Developing clear guidelines for distinguishing between these policies would help avoid this issue."

Drafting and Retention of Communications to StudentsSubject to the constraints of the communication channel used, all University communications to students should:be clear, courteous, accurate, appropriate, timely and jargon-free;contain the date;contain the author's name and position title and/or the details of the responsible department;contain the contact details of the person to whom enquiries about the communication should be directed, if it is not the author;be consistent with University policies and procedures;be appropriately retained in accordance with the University's Information and Records Management Policy.4. Departmental Responsibilities and AuthorityAcademic departments are responsible for: learning and teaching communications with their students;operational communications related to their students' working environment and the departmental administration of their courses, including communication of arrangements on days affected by adverse weather conditions (e.g. snow).Shared Services are responsible for: communicating with students, individually and in groups, on processes and information relating to the centralised academic administration of the student experience (e.g. enrolment).the provision of approval for the sending of eVision generated communications.the provision of approval for the sending of communications via AskOtago.Student and Academic Services are responsible for: authorising general information communications to be conveyed to students through the Student app or other email communication;serious incident communications involving individual students.Communications staff, acting as the Emergency Communications Team, are responsible for communications during a State of Campus Emergency, with the exception of announcements from the Vice-Chancellor or delegate, as per the Emergency Communications Plan.Staff members and units delivering specific services are responsible for: communicating with students, individually and in groups, on processes and information relating to their specific service;communicating on an individual basis with students who are engaged with their service.5. Student ResponsibilitiesStudents are required to check primary channels of communication regularly (at least weekly and preferably on each week day during teaching and examination periods) and to respond in a timely manner where necessary.Students should ensure they forward their student email to their personal email if that is their preference.Students are responsible for ensuring that only they have access to secure communication accounts associated with them and provided by the University; this includes their student email, student portal and Blackboard accounts.Students requesting personal or academic information by email should preferably do so via their student email address, as this shall be deemed to verify their identity.If a student responds to a staff email from an email address other than a University-assigned address, or provides an alternative email address for a specific purpose, they are required to reasonably monitor that email address for related University communications in addition to monitoring their student email address as per clause 5(a) above.The University does not accept responsibility for communications not being received by students where such communications are sent: via primary channels of communication; orto a student-provided alternative email address; oras a physical letter to a student's stated current address.Students are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date contact details in eVision, including their current physical address and next of kin/emergency contact details.",

        "content": "Management PrinciplesSpace is a significant financial and operational resource, the management of which has a direct impact on the University's ability to achieve its mission and strategic objectives.Space should be functionally suitable for its purpose, maintained in good condition, and utilised as efficiently as possible.The operational costs to Departments for space will be recovered through a space charging regime.All space is primarily held and administered by the University rather than by individual departments. However, subject to this policy, departments may make decisions about space which is allocated to them on an ongoing basis (e.g. allocation of office space to individual staff members.Allocation of space does not imply permanent allocation, but rather a commitment based upon continued justification and in consideration of campus wide space needs in response to ever changing University demands.Achievement of the University's strategic objectives and wider University needs will be given first priority in the allocation of space. Historic occupation and other factors will be given second priority.Space will be allocated to University Departments and their respective activities, employees and students in preference to external parties and retired staff.University space should not be assigned to non-University parties other than for a fee based commercial arrangement (license or lease) and managed by Property Services.Changes in allocation to address shortfalls in space or surpluses of space will be determined by the Asset Management Committee, based on either requests from departments, advice from Property Services or the results of annual or ad-hoc space reviews.The University's Design & Facility Standards will apply when determining the total amount of space required by departments and will guide space allocation in new buildings and refurbishment projects.No person is to be allocated more than one office or workspace on a campus, irrespective of the number of roles that person may perform.Occupying Departments will be encouraged to reduce required space and relinquish surplus space for re-purposing and re-allocation by internal rent reduction mechanisms in the Terms-of-Occupancy.Divisions will manage buildings and common locations so that postgraduate study space is shared wherever practical.ManagementTo ensure University Space is managed in a consistent, coordinated and legally compliant manner: Occupancy of Space by University groups is subject to the prevailing Terms-of-Occupancy.Property Services is the University's agent for managing space and is responsible for leasing, buying, selling and reporting on University land and buildings.Changes in allocation of space are administered by Property Services and changes must be supported by the Head of the relevant Division(s) and the Director of Property Services. Property Services shall be informed of any relevant changes of occupation and responsibility for database and charging purposes.Where a change in space allocation will affect another Division or Department, and an agreement cannot be reached, it will be referred to the Asset Management Committee for decision. The Committee may delegate such decisions to the Director of Property Services.All Teaching Spaces shall be centrally owned and recorded in Syllabus plus Enterprise (or equivalent replacement) and booked or scheduled in accordance with the Academic Timetabling Policy.To support the effective management of Space, Property Services will: Maintain an accurate database of building portfolio information.Maximise space utilisation by identifying and implementing opportunities to dispose of or repurpose surplus space in consultation with Divisions, Departments and/or the Asset Management Committee.Report space costs to Divisions, Departments and Senior Management annually.Undertake annual room use surveys, and ad-hoc surveys as required and report the survey results and comparisons with targets to the Asset Management Committee.Undertake annual surveys or ad-hoc surveys as required of condition and functionality, to assess the performance and appropriateness of University Space.Report to each Division annually on the results of the surveys outlined in (i)-(j) above.Annually, to align with the University's budget processes, meet with Heads of Divisions to: \u2013 review priorities on space allocation; and \u2013 identify projects and maintenance that improve efficiency, effectiveness, quality and/or reduce operating costs.Maintain a Strategic Asset Management Plan which includes performance targets and an activity schedule detailing work required to support core business activity (both teaching and research).Requests for Additional or Relinquishment of SpaceBefore approaching the Property Services Division with space requests, Heads of Schools/Departments must ensure that every effort to house new activities within existing space allocations has been exhausted.Heads of Schools/Departments are expected to initiate consultation on space with the Asset Management Team as soon as a space need is identified. A feasibility study will be carried out by the Asset Management Team and options developed. Where a change is mutually agreed by all parties it will then be reported to the Asset Management Committee. Where agreement is not reached then the change will be referred to the Committee for decision.Space is to be efficiently requested by Departments in advance and allocated by Property Services Division and the Asset Management Committee so that academic activities can be undertaken without due delay.Heads of Schools/Departments must recognise that not every demand for additional space can be met.Departments are encouraged to relinquish space that is surplus to requirements. The process for relinquishing space is to consult with the Asset Management Unit to ensure that the configuration of space being relinquished will allow for the space to be reused or repurposed as well as is possible. Once that is confirmed by the Asset Management Unit, the obligation to pay the Internal Rent for the space will cease effective from the following month.",

        "name": "Koha_Payments_Policy_and_Procedure",
        "scope": "Organisational scope not found",
        "content": "Purpose of Policy\nIn keeping with the University's commitment to acting in a manner consistent with the articles and spirit of the Treaty of Waitangi, the purpose of this policy is to provide guidance in determining the University's contribution to payments of Koha.\nBackground\nHui (cultural gathering) are an important part of M\u0101ori society. Tangi take precedence over all other Hui, and indeed over all other activities. When death occurs in the district, other gatherings are interrupted or cancelled so that the body may lie on the marae.\nIn historical M\u0101ori society (pre 1830) koha was a matter of custom, in the form of k\u016bmara, fish, preserved birds, eels, or any other foods gathered from land or sea in their local areas. In contemporary society most koha is in the form of money.\nDefinition\n1. Present, gift, parting or final instruction.\n2. For the purposes of this policy, the University of Otago defines 'gift' as unconditional, spontaneous gift (cash, goods or kind) given or received for unsolicited services, as within tikanga M\u0101ori. Koha will:\nbe in the form of cash;be paid to external person(s) or non-profit community groups who provide support, or undertake a one-off activity and expect non-payment for such activity or support in return;not be given in lieu of salary or as a payment for service(s) provided;generally not be given by the University to University of Otago employees.\n1. Determining University Payments of Koha\na. Procedure for determining University representation at cultural gathering (tangi, hui etc.)\nWhere staff attend a cultural gathering representing the University, the University will provide a contribution towards koha.\nTherefore:\nThe first point to consider is whether staff will attend in a personal capacity or whether they will attend as formal University representative(s). If there is an issue in determining mana or standing of the cultural gathering, advice should be sought from Divisional Heads and/or Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development to assist in the determination. If it is deemed that attendance will be in a personal capacity, then any koha will be the responsibility of the staff member(s) concerned.Notification should be made by the staff member(s) of the Hui (including tangi), to their Manager/Supervisor, where possible, before attending the cultural gathering. The staff member(s) will also provide him/her with details of the purpose of the gathering (kaupapa, mate - deceased person etc.) in particular, advice will be sought on: Importance of the event to the University.In relation to tangi: the deceased having mana (wisdom, importance); and/orsignificance and/or prominence within the community; and/orprominence and/or standing in the local or national tertiary sector; and/orassociation with the University of Otago.If the University is to be formally represented consideration will have to be given to the level of staff who should attend. In some cases senior University representation (i.e. Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor etc.) will be required. If there is difficulty in determining the level of representation, the Manager/Supervisor should contact the Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development to assist in deciding this.When formally represented, the University will provide koha, which is an unconditional gift. Koha will always be in the form of cash and the Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development will provide advice on the size of contribution.\nb. Other circumstances where koha payment may be made\nKoha as referred to in definitions on page one, may be paid to external non-profit community groups and individuals (non-University employees) in certain circumstances. This may include:\nacknowledging an individual or non-profit community group who support a conference opening;acknowledging an individual or non-profit community group who support an opening and/or blessing of a new building;where an individual or non-profit community group attend to support/lead a mihi whakatau (welcome) or poroporoaki (farewell or closing of a hui);where prominent guests are welcomed by mana whenua (people of the local area) at the request of the University of Otago.\n2. Procedure for Payment of Koha\na. Authorisation procedure for payment(s) of koha\nNotification should be made by the staff member to their Manager/Supervisor prior to payment, of the intention to provide a koha payment. The staff member will also provide him/her with: a brief explanation of the reason for the koha payment; andthe date of the event;details of who the payment will be made to;details of the amount of the proposed koha payment.Manager/Supervisor to make recommendation to Divisional Head for the payment of koha.The payment of koha, as defined within this policy will be approved by Divisional Head. If there is difficulty in determining whether such a koha payment is in line with this policy, the Manager/Supervisor and/or Divisional Head should contact the Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development to assist in any determination.\nb. Administration Procedures for payment(s) of koha\nFollowing the approval for koha, as described above, the staff member should email Revenue Management, Finance Services, Shared Services, a copy of documentation as detailed in 2A (i), along with the authorisation of their Divisional Head.\nRevenue Management, Finance Services, Shared Services, will arrange for the cash to be collected.\nAll payments determined as koha under this policy will not be liable for GST, FBT or PAYE, unless paid to staff or former staff (where advice should be sought from the Financial Controller, Financial Services).",

        "q4_response": "After analyzing the provided JSON data, I have identified the following redundancy or incorrect structure of policy:\n\n1. **Redundant cross-references**: The policy document contains multiple references to other policies (e.g., page one, Divisional Heads, Financial Controller) that are not explicitly linked in the provided JSON data. These references may be necessary for understanding the context, but they do not add value as redundant information.\n2. **Procedural sections masquerading as policy**: The \"Koha_Payments_Policy_and_Procedure\" document has a significant portion dedicated to procedures (e.g., step-by-step instructions on how to determine University payments of Koha) rather than overarching policies or principles. While these procedures are essential, they should be considered separate from the policy itself.\n3. **Unclear distinction between policy and procedure**: The document's structure blurs the line between policy and procedure. Some sections, like the \"Definitions\" section, seem to provide guidance on specific aspects of koha payments, while others (e.g., the payment procedures) appear more procedural in nature.\n\nTo address these issues:\n\n* Consider removing or consolidating redundant cross-references to reduce clutter and improve readability.\n* Separate the policy document into distinct sections: one for overarching principles/policies and another for procedures/guidelines.\n* Use clear headings and subheadings to distinguish between different types of content (e.g., \"Definitions,\" \"Procedures,\" etc.).\n\nThese adjustments can help simplify the policy document, make it easier to understand, and promote a clearer distinction between policy and procedure."

It would be beneficial to elaborate on its relevance to the policy.\n\n3. **Inconsistent terminology**: The terms \"Permit to Work system\" and \"Permit to Work manual\" are used interchangeably but should be defined clearly and consistently. This could lead to confusion among stakeholders about which document is being referred to.\n\n4. **Overemphasis on regulatory requirements**: While regulatory requirements are essential, the policy places too much emphasis on them. A more balanced approach that considers industry best practices and organizational values would be beneficial.\n\n5. **Lack of clear scope**: The policy has a broad scope covering various types of work and activities where the University has legal responsibility. However, it would be beneficial to have a clearer definition of what is considered \"high-risk work\" and how it will be evaluated.\n\n6. **No distinction between policies and procedures**: The policy document mixes policies (rules or principles) with procedures (instructions on how to do something). It would be helpful to clearly distinguish between these two categories to avoid confusion among stakeholders.\n\n7. **Insufficient review of policy effectiveness**: The policy mentions that it will be regularly reviewed, but it does not specify who will conduct the reviews, what criteria will be used to evaluate its effectiveness, or when the next review will take place.\n\n8. **No clear process for updating the policy**: The policy document does not provide a clear process for updating it. It would be beneficial to establish a clear procedure for revising and updating the policy to ensure that it remains relevant and effective over time."

They must also have the resources available to manage and execute the sponsorship.The benefits of undertaking a sponsorship must clearly justify the investment.Sponsorships are for a finite period. Individual Sponsorship Agreements should be for terms not exceeding three years.Staff involved in sponsorship decisions should be aware of the potential for real or apparent conflict of interest.\u00a0\u00a0This should be managed in accordance with the University's Conflicts of Interest Policy.Where possible, the University will have tertiary industry exclusivity in all sponsorship agreements.Application and approval processesTo achieve a consistent approach to sponsorship, all applications should be assessed according to the Sponsorship Guidelines.Responsibility for approval and funding of any sponsorship request lies with the area that receives the request.The sponsorship owner must be satisfied that in exchange for providing the sponsorship, the University will receive benefits commensurate with the level of investment, both monetary and in-kind.Where a Division receives a sponsorship request it is recommended they inform Marketing Services at sponsorships@otago.ac.nz prior to undertaking any formal negotiations. Marketing Services can provide advice and notify of any potential clashes with the University's sponsorship objectives or other sponsorship commitments.All approved sponsorships must be documented and registered with Marketing Services. A sponsorship letter may be used to document a sponsorship valued up to $5,000.A full sponsorship agreement must be used to document a sponsorship valued at more than $5,000.Any person signing sponsorship agreements and committing to funding must be acting in accordance with their delegated authority.Copies of final and co-signed Sponsorship Letters and Agreements should be sent to sponsorships@otago.ac.nz.Use of University's brandThe University's brand, including but not limited to its logo, must not be used in association with any sponsorship until the sponsorship has been approved.Regardless of who is funding the sponsorship, the main University of Otago brand will be used unless approval is otherwise given by the Director of Marketing Services.All marketing and promotional activities associated with the sponsorship must comply with Brand Guidelines and be approved by Marketing Services prior to use.Management and review of sponsorship arrangementsThe sponsorship owner has responsibility for oversight, management and execution of the sponsorship.For sponsorships of $5,000 or more, a review of effectiveness should be produced by the sponsorship owner with support from the sponsored party. This review will form the basis of future involvement with the sponsorship when the term of the agreement expires.\u00a0\u00a0For multiyear agreements, reviews should be completed annually.

        "q3_response": "After reviewing the provided policy data, I have identified several policies that contain inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. **Vehicle Safety and Inspection**: Section 2.3 mentions that all university vehicles used for university business must meet certain safety requirements, but it does not explicitly state who is responsible for ensuring compliance with these requirements.\n\n2. **Driving**: The section on driving contains procedural instructions rather than rules or principles. While this is a common structure in many policies, it may make the policy more difficult to understand and enforce.\n\n3. **Incidents**: Similar to the driving section, the incident reporting procedures (Section 3) contain procedural instructions that may be more suitable for an operational guide or manual.\n\n4. **Unclear Scope**: The scope of the policy is somewhat unclear, particularly with regards to who is included under \"Staff personal vehicles may be authorised for use for University business\" and what constitutes a \"contractor engaged by the University\". Clarifying these points could help ensure consistency in application of the policy.\n\n5. **External References**: While not necessarily structural flaws, the policy contains several external references to other codes of practice (e.g., HSNO, NZS 5433 Transport of Dangerous Goods on Land) that may need to be updated or clarified for internal stakeholders.\n\n6. **Lack of Clear Roles and Responsibilities**: The policy could benefit from clearer definitions of roles and responsibilities, particularly in regards to who is responsible for ensuring compliance with vehicle safety requirements and reporting incidents.\n\n7. **Insufficient Guidance for Privately Owned Vehicles**: The policy does not provide sufficient guidance for privately owned vehicles used by staff or contractors.

        "q4_response": "After reviewing the provided policy data, I have identified several redundancy and structural flaws in the policy:\n\n1. **Redundant Content**: The policy contains some redundant content, such as the mention of \"Secure footwear must be worn at all times while driving.\" This is already covered under the broader requirement to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., seat belts).\n\n2. **Unclear Scope**: The scope of the policy is somewhat unclear, particularly with regards to who is included under \"Staff personal vehicles may be authorised for use for University business\" and what constitutes a \"contractor engaged by the University\". Clarifying these points could help ensure consistency in application of the policy.\n\n3. **Lack of Clear Roles and Responsibilities**: The policy could benefit from clearer definitions of roles and responsibilities, particularly in regards to who is responsible for ensuring compliance with vehicle safety requirements and reporting incidents.\n\n4. **Insufficient Guidance for Privately Owned Vehicles**: The policy does not provide sufficient guidance for privately owned vehicles used by staff or contractors. It would be helpful to include clear expectations and procedures for these situations.\n\n5. **No Clear Procedure for Risk Assessment**: Section 2.1 mentions the possibility of approving purchases that do not meet certain safety criteria, but it does not provide a clear procedure for conducting these risk assessments.\n\n6. **External References**: While not necessarily structural flaws, the policy contains several external references to other codes of practice (e.g., HSNO, NZS 5433 Transport of Dangerous Goods on Land) that may need to be updated or clarified for internal stakeholders.\n\n7. **Procedure vs. Rule**: Some sections of the policy contain procedural instructions rather than rules or principles. While this is a common structure in many policies, it may make the policy more difficult to understand and enforce.\n\n8. **Inconsistent Language**: The policy uses inconsistent language throughout. For example, some sections refer to \"authorised\" drivers, while others use \"approved\" drivers. It would be helpful to establish a consistent terminology throughout the policy.\n\n9. **Lack of Clear Penalties for Non-Compliance**: The policy does not clearly outline the consequences for non-compliance with its requirements. Establishing clear penalties and enforcement procedures can help ensure that the policy is respected and effective.\n\n10. **No Review Date or Update Process**: The policy does not include a review date or an update process. Regular reviews and updates can help ensure that the policy remains relevant, effective, and aligned with changing regulatory requirements.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the policy can be made more clear, consistent, and effective in achieving its objectives."

Potential exposure\nThe potential for exposure to biological pathogens associated with the work task/environment is to be clearly identified in the hazard/risk register within Vault.\n2. Vaccination requirements\nWhere effective immunisation vaccinations are available for potential work-related biological pathogen exposure, these will be required before the commencement of work.\u00a0\u00a0Vaccination is offered as a reasonably practical step under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015.New biological pathogens requiring vaccination, such as COVID\u201119, will be managed according to national Ministry of Health Guidelines, and a suitable risk assessment conducted to identify areas of high risk where vaccination may be required, or highly recommended.\n3. Biological pathogens training programme\nWhere biological pathogen exposure risks are identified, workers will undertake a formal training programme including the following:\nDescription of the hazard/risk.Method of transmission.Controls to prevent transmission.Specifics of immunisation vaccination including reliability, side effects, test, and vaccination procedure.Process of consent.Privacy and holding of records.Options for individuals who choose not to be vaccinated or cannot be immunised.\n4. Employee consent\nA completed consent form is required prior to any vaccination.Individuals are not obliged to accept the University's offer of vaccination. Where an employee chooses not to have the vaccination, an alternative hazard/risk exposure assessment with control methods must be considered to minimise the risk of exposure. Refusal to accept the vaccination will be recorded by the Occupational Health team in the occupational health recording system.\n5. Immunisation status and records\nThe immunisation status of employees will be assessed, and vaccination offered according to the level of risk associated with the work tasks and work environment.Records of vaccination and immunisation status must be maintained on the Employee's occupational health file.Where a risk assessment identifies vaccination as a preferred control in relation to the person's position, this will be recorded in Vault with the vaccination status recorded as yes or no.\n6. Cost of vaccination\nCosts associated with vaccinations required under this policy for staff will be borne by the University.",

Sick leave provisions\nAll employees, whether academic or general, are entitled to sick leave, the precise amount varying according to the individual employee's employment contract and the date on which they commenced employment with the University. Part-time employees working less than full-time or less than five days per week or less than 52 weeks per year receive a pro-rated entitlement. Sick leave is computed against working days only (i.e. weekends and public holidays are not included).A medical certificate is required when absences exceed five consecutive working days, and for absences of shorter periods if required by the University in individual cases.Where employees require leave to care for a person dependent on them, examples include a sick child, partner or family member, the employees concerned may have such absence counted against their own sick leave entitlement, if available, up to the limit provided for in their employment contract.\n2. Actions and responsibilities\nHeads of Departments Each Head of Department must ensure that all employees submit their sick leave requests via the employee kiosk leave approval system (where access to the web kiosk is available).Cases of extended sick leave must be communicated to Payroll Services so that salary overpayments do not occur in cases where the employee has already used up the full entitlement. Extended absences of more than three weeks duration must be also notified in writing to the Director, Human Resources Division, through the respective Divisional Office.Staff members Employees are required to notify absences due to illness or injury to their Head of Department through their immediate supervisor, whenever possible, within 30 minutes of normal starting time. Immediately on their return to work employees must submit their sick leave requests via the employee kiosk leave approval system (where access to the web kiosk is available). When applicable, a medical certificate must be supplied to the Head of Department.Human Resources The Human Resources Division is responsible for negotiating appropriate sick leave provisions into employment contracts and for providing advice on the interpretation of employment condition provisions and provisions of the Holidays Act 2003 if or when these arise.\n3. Accident reporting and rehabilitation policy\nAll injuries, both of a work and a non-work nature, must be reported in accordance with the Incident Reporting Policy. Please refer to this policy for full procedures.Absenteeism as a consequence of a work accident/injury is not charged against sick leave but is a full charge against the Departmental budget where not recovered from the University's insurer.The first week of a non-work accident/injury is recorded against the employee's sick leave entitlement. After this, only 20 per cent or 1 day per week is recorded against sick leave entitlements, BUT 80 per cent of each week's salary is recoverable from ACC , and this is credited back to the employee's cost centre. All non-work accidents/injuries must therefore be reported to allow recovery from ACC .\n4.

'Seismic_Policy'\n\nThe section \"Heritage buildingsAll heritage buildings are to have their heritage status considered in seismic strengthening designs.\" can be seen as an instruction on how to design seismic strengthening for heritage buildings.\n\nThese sections provide more procedural guidance rather than defining rules or principles.",

This inconsistency may lead to confusion about how to handle seismic assessments.\n3. **Cross-references to other policies**: The presence of cross-references to other policies, such as Clause 5(c) and Clause 5 of the Seismic Programme Guidelines, makes the policy seem less self-contained and more reliant on external documents.

More detailed procedures and guidelines would be helpful in this area.\n5. **Unclear importance level determination process**: The policy states that the importance level can be reduced when activities within the building drive the importance level, but it's not entirely clear how this reduction is determined or what factors are taken into account. More clarity on this process would help stakeholders understand their responsibilities and obligations.\n\nThese issues suggest that while the policy provides some valuable guidelines and principles for managing seismic risks, there are areas where it could be improved to make it more consistent, clear, and self-contained."

Students are encouraged to make use of the advice available from Te Whare T\u0101wharau. OUSA Student Support is also available for advice and support for students.Confidential staff are not required to advise any other party of information they receive regarding sexual misconduct, but: may do so where that is consistent with, or required by, their professional ethical obligations or, in the case of Te Whare T\u0101wharau advocates, by relevant Te Whare T\u0101wharau guidelines, andmay advise the SMART Co\u2011ordinator, or the Director of Human Resources in cases involving staff, that they have received such information and discuss the handling of the situation in general terms (identifying the affected party only if they consent).Staff receiving a disclosure of sexual misconduct are expected to: offer to facilitate contact with a support provider (see options listed at the end of this policy), and, where the affected party is a student, specifically advise the party from whom they received that information of the services available from Te Whare T\u0101wharau and offer to facilitate contact with Te Whare T\u0101wharauadvise the party from whom they received that information of the right of an affected party to seek a formal investigation, which may be initiated through the Police, the office of the Proctor, a Senior Residential College staff member, or the Director of Human Resources as appropriate, andadvise the SMART Co\u2011ordinator of the disclosure (identifying the affected party only if they consent) so that SMART can: maintain an overview of disclosed incidents across the Universityensure, as far as consistent with the affected party's willingness to be identified, that support is provided in accordance with clause 7, andassist in a determination of whether the disclosed incident constitutes alleged grievous sexual misconduct, if required in cases of alleged student misconduct, andadvise the Director of Human Resources where the disclosure relates to potential misconduct by a staff member (identifying the affected party only if they consent).Students receiving a disclosure of Sexual Misconduct from another student are encouraged to: advise the party from who they received that information of the services available from Te Whare T\u0101wharau (including that Te Whare T\u0101wharau can provide information on other support services), and to offer to facilitate contact between Te Whare T\u0101wharau and that party, andadvise the Te Whare T\u0101wharau Manager that they have received such a disclosure and pass on such information as they consider appropriate having first discussed the matter of disclosure with the Te Whare T\u0101wharau Manager.Staff or students receiving a disclosure of sexual misconduct may contact the SMART Co\u2011ordinator for advice.\n5. General principles applying to disclosures of sexual misconduct\nAll members of the University affected by sexual misconduct are entitled to reasonable access to relevant resources, including advocacy and counselling.\u00a0\u00a0Support is also available for students dealing with events which precede enrolment at university, and which impact their ability to work or study.To encourage disclosure, the University of Otago generally will not hold affected parties, disclosing parties or witnesses involved in the addressing of sexual misconduct accountable for breaches of any University policies relating to alcohol or drugs that may have occurred at the time of the alleged sexual misconduct.The University will, to the full extent possible, respect and safeguard the privacy of individuals who disclose allegations of sexual misconduct and all others involved in the process.\u00a0\u00a0Information will be shared only on a need-to-know basis with those who have a role in dealing with the situation under this policy or who have a role in dealing with urgent concerns regarding the safety or welfare of individuals, or as required by natural justice as per clause 5(d) below.Where a complaint is made against a person and investigated by the University, the respondent shall have rights to access all relevant information and to respond prior to a finding being made.\u00a0\u00a0Relevant information may be withheld during the investigative stage of the process, if disclosure may prejudice the investigation, but will be available subsequently.The University, through SMART, will keep a central record of disclosures, in a manner that does not enable individuals to be identified, in order to be able to assess trends and inform best practice and ongoing education.\n6. University response to disclosures of sexual misconduct\nThe University will, in the first instance, respond to all disclosures of sexual misconduct by ensuring the affected party has access to appropriate support (see clause 7).Affected parties may choose to: Make a disclosure without raising a formal complaint: If this only involves seeking support and/or accommodations as per clause 9 below, then the respondent will not be involved or notified, and their identity does not need to be revealed.If this involves seeking protective measures as per clause 9, the respondent will need to be identified and notified of the request, so that protective measures can be discussed.Make a formal complaint: This may also include a request for protective measures or accommodations as per clause 9 below.This requires disclosure of the respondent's identity, who will need to be informed of the identity of the affected party and of the allegations they are making, if the complaint is progressed (see also clause 5(d) above).Formal complaints against students may be dealt with under the following pathways: For grievous sexual misconduct, referral or direct complaint to Police (see also clause 11).For other sexual misconduct, either: University investigation (see clause 10), orcomplaint to Police (see also clause 11).Formal complaints against staff will be managed by Human Resources under the Ethical Behaviour Policy and the staff member's employment agreement or independent contract with the University.\u00a0\u00a0 This may include formal investigation by Human Resources and/or Police involvement as appropriate. An affected party complaining about a staff member may raise the matter directly with the Police if that is their preference.An affected party shall, as far as possible subject to this policy, be entitled to choose the manner in which an allegation is addressed and shall be entitled to change that decision at any time.Where a determination is needed as to whether a formal complaint is considered grievous sexual misconduct (see clause 4(d)iii), or to otherwise assess the level at which a complaint may be considered (see clause 10(b)), the University may seek additional information from the affected party.\u00a0\u00a0In doing so, and so as to minimise trauma and ensure no prejudice in any subsequent investigation: information will be collected in a sensitive manner, which may entail collection through a trusted support person and subsequent relay to the SMART Co\u2011ordinatorinformation collected will be limited to that required to make the relevant determinationa brief record of the basis of the determination will be kept, but no formal statement will be taken, andas far as is practicable, any requirement that the affected party repeat their story will be avoided.Where an affected party who is a student wishes a matter referred to the Police, Te Whare T\u0101wharau and/or the Director of Human Resources (as appropriate) are available if that affected party so wishes to facilitate that referral and to ensure that affected party is provided support.The Proctor may require students who are involved in a Police or University investigation to comply with protective measures as provided for under clause 9 of this policy and/or interim measures under Student Conduct Statute.\u00a0\u00a0The Director of Human Resources may establish and require a member of staff to comply with interim measures consistent with their employment or contractual arrangements with the University.In investigating any allegations, the University will treat all parties and witnesses with dignity and respect.A clear distinction will be maintained between those offering advocacy or ongoing support to those involved in investigations and those responsible for undertaking investigations.\n7. Support following an incident being disclosed\nAs soon as possible after an incident is disclosed, the staff member to whom the disclosure has been made shall notify the SMART Co\u2011ordinator who shall ensure that an appropriate staff member is assigned responsibility for as many of the following as are appropriate to the circumstances: assessing the affected party's safety and well-being and any issues there may be for the safety or wellbeing of the University communityensuring\u00a0\u00a0that suitable support is in place for all affected parties and any other parties that may be involvedinforming the affected party of the right to contact Police and offering to facilitate such contactdiscussing with the affected party the issue of the need to seek medical treatment, and, where relevant, explaining the importance of obtaining and preserving forensic and other evidence (including digital or social media material that may be relevant)informing the affected party of their ability to seek to have protective measures or accommodations put in place, including options for, and available assistance with, changing academic, living, transportation, and/or working situationsinforming the affected party about resources available at the University and in the community, including advocacy and support servicesinforming the affected party of their options, including with reference to whether the matter is considered grievous sexual misconduct, and where appropriate seeking consent to initiate an investigation, and discussing with them any concerns or barriers to participating in the investigationoutlining to the affected party the applicable procedure(s) for University investigations, the range of possible outcomes, and privacy implications of proceeding with a complaint (see clause 5(d))explaining\u00a0\u00a0to any relevant parties that the University does not tolerate retaliation and that the University will take prompt action in response to any act of retaliationassessing whether the incident should also be referred for action under the Student Critical Incident Policy or Staff Critical Incident Policy, particularly where there has been serious injury to the affected party, or serious distress or harm caused to a group within the University community, andtaking any other measures that are deemed necessary or desirable.

Confidentiality, limits on confidentiality and requests for no action\nConfidential staff members may on some occasions have an obligation to pass information on, such as when there is perceived to be significant risk to the safety of the person making the disclosure or to the safety of others.In some cases, including where there is a significant risk to the University community, a situation may warrant formal University investigation even if the disclosing party and/or the affected party has not directly sought this.\u00a0\u00a0This may be determined by: the Director of Human Resources in cases where the respondent is a University staff member, orthe Vice-Chancellor, in consultation with the SMART Co\u2011ordinator, in all other cases.Where a decision to proceed with an investigation is made under clause 8(b), the Human Resources Director (or their delegate) or the SMART Co\u2011ordinator shall, prior to the commencement of the investigation, discuss with the affected or disclosing party: the reasons for deciding that the matter needed to be investigated, andthe means by which risks to the affected party, disclosing party or any other party arising from a decision to investigate may be managed.Subject to any requirements or expectations that may arise for members of the University staff, affected parties, respondents and witnesses may choose not to participate in University investigations, and have no obligation to cooperate or offer information or evidence.\n9. Protective measures and accommodations\nAn affected party, or any person acting on an affected party's behalf, may seek to have protective measures or accommodations put in place, being: measures available and approved under other University regulations and proceduresmeasures voluntarily agreed to by the affected and respondent parties (any agreement to such measures by a respondent party in the absence of a formal investigation shall not be considered indicative of an acceptance that sexual misconduct has occurred).measures imposed by the Proctor pursuant to their powers under the Student Conduct Statutemeasures imposed by the Head of a Residential College under College rulesmeasures established by the Director of Human Resources in accordance with the employment or contractual arrangements the University has with the party intended to be subject to the measures.measures which it is reasonable in all the circumstances to put in place to manage interactions and relationships between students who are involved in allegations of sexual misconduct, whether or not such allegations have been or are able to be established.Accommodations that may be available (subject, where required, to approval under other University regulations and procedures) include: changes to accommodation, access to counselling and medical services, voluntary leave of absences or withdrawal from paper(s)provision of Campus Watch escortsconfidential counselling through Student Health, Te Huka M\u0101tauraka/M\u0101ori Centre, ACC or the Employment Assistance Programmearrangements for students where study or performance has been affected, including: special consideration in final examinations or in internal work submissions, tests and assessments or withdrawal from a paper or papers\u00a0\u00a0(see the Examination and Assessment Regulations and the Special Consideration in Student Assessment Procedures)flexible class attendance or transfer to another lecture stream.as approved by Human Resources, arrangements for staff in the following areas: flexible working arrangements, including changes to start and finish hours or change of location or, in some instances, job assignmentleave to attend appointments or for other reasons related to the sexual misconduct.\u00a0\u00a0Leave can be paid or unpaid depending on the duration of the leave and individual circumstances and requirements.Protective measures imposed on respondent parties may include: no-contact ordersprohibition on attending events or being on campus, or otherwise limiting access to specified campus spacesmeasures put in place under Residential College rulesmeasures consistent with the respondent's employment agreement or contract with the University.Where the Proctor determines that protective measures should be imposed, any parties subject to those measures may seek to have this decision reviewed by the Provost, if they consider these measures are unreasonable.Any person establishing protective measures under the authority of this policy shall also consider whether the respondent should be encouraged to seek counselling, educational opportunities or other guidance or support in connection with the issues being managed by those measures.\u00a0\u00a0Any engagement with such support shall not be taken as acceptance that sexual misconduct has occurred.\n10. Formal Investigation by the University\nWhere the University conducts a formal investigation into an allegation against a student, the investigator who shall establish and conduct the investigation will be the Proctor or their appointee (an appropriate person appointed in consultation with the SMART Co-ordinator), or another appropriate investigator appointed by the SMART Co\u2011ordinator. The investigator shall ensure that the SMART Co-ordinator is aware of the investigation and the SMART Co-ordinator shall assign a team of at least two SMART members to deal with any relevant matters in connection with the investigation.Where the University conducts a formal investigation into an allegation against a staff member, the Director of Human Resources will establish an investigation in accordance with the applicable Human Resources processes. The Director of Human Resources may advise the SMART Co-ordinator of the investigation and invite them to appoint one or more SMART members to be available to assist with the investigation.The University will seek to complete investigations in a timely manner, taking into account the complexities of the case.\u00a0\u00a0Expected timeframes will be communicated to affected and respondent parties, and updates on any changes to estimated timeframes provided.Where a University investigation into a complaint about a student is commenced, and the process of investigation subsequently identifies that the alleged misconduct includes grievous sexual misconduct, the University will pause its investigation and support the complainant to raise the matter with Police should they wish to do so.\u00a0\u00a0All other provisions in this policy, including the availability of protective measures, shall apply.Subject to the following provisions, the process of investigation to be followed in each case shall be determined by those responsible for the investigation having regard to the nature of the complaint and the overall circumstances.An investigation into the behaviour of a student shall ensure fairness to all parties involved, including by: allowing any party who wishes to do so to have support or representation, andensuring that a party against whom an allegation is made is fairly informed of: fair detail of the allegation and of their right to be heardthe potential sanctions if an allegation is upheld, andtheir right to decline to participate in the investigation and the implications of this, including that the investigation will proceed without their input.An investigation into a person employed or engaged by the University shall be carried out in a way that is consistent with the requirements of the applicable employment agreement or independent contract terms.The person responsible for an investigation may consult with SMART at any time during the course of an investigation and, in the case of allegations against students, shall do so before finalising their investigation report. SMART may provide advice to the investigator including recommending that further investigation is undertaken before a report is finalised.Investigations shall conclude with a report detailing the investigator's conclusions which may include findings: that sexual misconduct has occurredthat sexual misconduct has not occurred or is unable to be proved to the necessary standard by the available evidence, orthat the investigation has been unable to determine whether sexual misconduct has occurred but considers the matter should be left open pending the possibility of further evidence becoming available.Following the conclusion of an investigation: interim measures that have been established for students remain in place unless cancelled by the Proctor or Head of Residential College on the advice of SMART, andthe Proctor, Head of Residential College or Director of Human Resources (as the case may be) may impose further or alternative protective measures which are considered appropriate to manage the situation on an ongoing basis having regard to the interests of any affected party, any respondent parties, interests of any others involved in the matter and the interests of the wider University community.In the event that the investigation has concluded that sexual misconduct has occurred: the Proctor may exercise their powers under the Student Conduct Statute to impose an appropriate penalty on a student or may refer the matter to the Provost for determination or further referral to the Vice-Chancellor, and/orresponsible Residential College authorities may take appropriate steps under Residential College rules, orthe Director of Human Resources may cause appropriate steps to be taken under a staff member's employment agreement or contract.\n11. University Actions where a Police Complaint is Made\nWhere a complaint is made to the Police and the matter is as yet unresolved through Police or criminal justice system processes the University shall establish such protective measures as are necessary to support the affected party.In cases where the respondent is a student, regardless of any outcome through the criminal justice system, the Proctor may determine that it is appropriate to continue to require compliance with protective measures.Where a respondent admits or is found guilty of sexual misconduct under criminal justice system processes, the University will, as appropriate and on the basis of that finding, apply its own subsequent processes under the Student Conduct Statute, Ethical Behaviour Policy and/or other relevant Statutes, policies or contractual agreements.In cases where the respondent party is a staff member, regardless of any outcome through the criminal justice system, the University reserves the right to complete any relevant Human Resources processes under the direction of the Director of Human Resources.\n12. Sanctions\nAny action taken against a student shall be taken under the Student Conduct Statute 2021 and/or Residential College rules.Any action against a staff member or independent contractor shall be in accordance with their employment agreement/contract, University policy and employment law and taken by those with the authority to do so.Nothing in this policy limits the University from imposing sanctions on a respondent where they have admitted sexual misconduct or have been found by a court to have committed acts amounting to sexual misconduct.",

General\nStaff are provided with facilities and equipment to access the internet for legitimate work related activity.Staff are also allowed to use the University's internet facilities for non-work related activity provided this is carried out outside of usual work hours and is limited to three hours each week with no more than one hour each day. This includes personal use of social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.Staff are prohibited from: creating, viewing, accessing, attempting to access, storing, or displaying inappropriate material either electronically or in hard copy.If staff receive an email containing inappropriate content they must delete it immediately and, where the sender is known to them, notify the sender not to send such emails.If staff inadvertently open a website containing inappropriate content they must exit from the website immediately.All peer to peer usage must be for legitimate University business only.It is accepted that there may be occasions when access by academic staff to inappropriate material, or exchanges of such material between academic colleagues, is needed for research or teaching purposes. In those circumstances academic staff must be able to justify their access to the University's satisfaction, or have written authorisation for such access from their Head of Division (Deans in Health Sciences).\n2. Blocking Access to Certain Websites\nThe University will restrict access to certain categories of website and will manage this by classifying websites into three categories: Sites that are available at all times, this is all sites except b & c below.Sites blocked during normal work hours, which is defined as between 8:30am to 12 noon and 2pm to 5pm, Monday to Friday. These are categories of sites that are very unlikely to have a legitimate work usage and include: Auction sitesDating sitesGambling sitesGame sitesSites that contain pornographic and/or objectionable material will be completely blocked as far as is practicable.The Vice-Chancellor will determine the sites to be blocked upon a recommendation from the Chief Digital Officer.Any staff member who has a legitimate need to access sites under categories b & c may apply to their Head of Division (Deans in Health Sciences) to gain access.ITS will be responsible for managing the internet restrictions and Departments are required to ensure that their internet access is filtered according to this Policy and that any internet management software is installed as determined by ITS .\n3. Monitoring and Enforcement\nComputing equipment and access to the internet are provided for work purposes and not for personal use. Accordingly, with the prior approval of the Vice-Chancellor, the University may track the usage, or examine the content, of any computer which has been provided by the University, or which is connected to its networks, at any time without prior notice to the staff member using the computer. This includes accessing emails or other electronic communications. Where such access would be appropriate for genuine academic, commercial, or other reasons, an exemption must be obtained from the staff member's Head of Division.ITS is responsible for monitoring internet usage and the management of the network in accordance with this policy. This includes: tracking usage and identifying any concerns;establishing a system for staff to acknowledge the policy when they log on for the first time and for this to be repeated annually.ITS will advise the relevant Head of Division and the Human Resources Director of any suspected breaches of this policy. Any concerns will be investigated in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Ethical Behaviour Policy. Breaches of this policy may be viewed as serious misconduct which could result in disciplinary action being taken.",

This content could be considered cross-referential, as it mentions \"procedures outlined in the Ethical Behaviour Policy\". However, I would argue that this is not truly unnecessary content, but rather a necessary part of maintaining policy enforcement.\n\nIf we consider 'unnecessary' content to mean sections or sentences that do not directly contribute to the main purpose or objectives of the policy, then I would identify another section as potentially unnecessary:\n\nThe Internet Usage Policy has two separate sections (points 1 and 2) that describe internet usage rules. While these rules are important for staff compliance, point 2 could be considered slightly more redundant as it provides additional details on blocking access to certain websites, which is already covered in point 3.\n\nPlease note that the interpretation of 'unnecessary' content may vary depending on individual perspectives and priorities within the organization's policies.",

Section 1 (point 2): \"Blocking Access to Certain Websites\" - This section provides additional details on blocking access to certain websites and how departments should filter their internet access.

While it is intended to provide clarity on specific categories of websites, the detailed instructions on blocking access and internet management software installation in Section 3 already address these aspects.\n\n2. The section \"Monitoring and Enforcement\" (point 3) could be considered a procedure or instruction rather than a policy. It outlines specific procedures for monitoring internet usage, tracking concerns, investigating breaches, and taking disciplinary action, which may not be necessary to include as part of the policy itself.\n\nThese potential inconsistencies do not necessarily render these sections unnecessary, but they could be reorganized or refined to better align with the overall structure and purpose of the policy.",

While it is intended to provide clarity on specific categories of websites, the detailed instructions on blocking access and internet management software installation in Section 3 already address these aspects.\n2. **Procedure vs. policy**: Section 3 (\"Monitoring and Enforcement\") could be considered a procedure or instruction rather than a policy. It outlines specific procedures for monitoring internet usage, tracking concerns, investigating breaches, and taking disciplinary action, which may not be necessary to include as part of the policy itself.\n3. **Cross-referential content**: The mention of \"procedures outlined in the Ethical Behaviour Policy\" in Section 3 is cross-referential, but it could be considered unnecessary as it only serves to connect to another policy rather than providing additional value to the Internet Usage Policy.\n4. **Repetition of rules**: While not necessarily redundant, there are repeated mentions of staff being prohibited from accessing certain types of content (e.g., \"Staff are prohibited from...\"). This repetition may highlight the need for a more concise and consistent approach to outlining policy objectives.\n\nTo improve the structure and clarity of the policy, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. Merge Section 2 with Section 3 or rephrase it to make it more concise and relevant to the overall purpose of the policy.\n2. Consider removing or consolidating sections that provide detailed procedures or instructions, as they may not be necessary to include in the policy itself.\n3. Review cross-referential content to ensure it is only included when providing additional value to the policy rather than serving solely as a connecting link to another policy.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential inconsistencies and redundancies in the policy, these can often be addressed through careful review, consolidation, or rephrasing of specific sections."

        "content": "1. Applications for Externally Funded Research\nAn application for external research funding binds the University to fair and accurate representations of its research capacity and the ability of its employees to undertake lawful research investigations.To submit a research funding application which makes any named reference to the University of Otago, researchers must have in place a formal relationship with the University. Aside from an employment contract, eligible relationships include honorary and joint clinical appointments and prospective employees who have approval of the relevant Head of Department (HoD) and appropriate Dean or Pro-Vice-Chancellor (PVC) to submit an application.Where a budget is required for an application or formal proposal, it must be prepared in accordance with the costing and consenting process and approval delegations that are outlined in the Administration of Externally Funded Research Procedures.All applications and formal proposals for externally funded research must be submitted to the appropriate R&E staff member by the advertised internal deadline. The R&E Office will submit the application to the funder on behalf of the University.\n2. Exchange Research\nIn accordance with the University of Otago Financial Delegations Procedure, Agreements for exchange research involving the University, its facilities or staff must be executed by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Enterprise (DVC R&E) or their delegated authority.Ownership of the intellectual property associated with exchange research will be stipulated in the terms of each Agreement.The R&E Office will undertake all assessment and negotiation of Exchange Research Agreements on behalf of the University of Otago in consultation with the researcher(s) involved. All Agreements will be reviewed to: Ensure that the initiatives complement teaching and are consistent with the University's vision, mission and strategic direction;Ensure that staff and students are protected from exploitation;Ensure that students can submit their theses;Ensure that the contract is legally valid and is in alignment with applicable legislative requirements;Ensure that the right to publish has been considered and addressed to the satisfaction of all parties;Ensure that risk assessment has been appropriately undertaken; and,Ensure that the research meets appropriate ethical standards and any other regulatory requirements.The University retains the right to refuse contracts for exchange research that are incompatible with its vision, mission, statutory obligations and/or strategic objectives.\n3. Non-Exchange Research\nOwnership of results, outputs and intellectual property associated with non-exchange research will always remain with the University.In some cases, non-exchange research funds do not have associated Agreements. However, funding must be accompanied by a letter of award or equivalent in all cases.The R&E Office will undertake assessment of the documentation associated with all non-exchange research.The University retains the right to refuse non-exchange research that is incompatible with its vision, mission, statutory obligations and/or strategic objectives.\n4. Contracting and Execution of Agreements\nAll Agreements (including non-exchange Agreements) involving the University of Otago are between the funder and the University of Otago. At times there may be other parties involved. Employees of the University are not usually a party to any Agreement unless they have permission in writing from the DVC R&E or the Vice-Chancellor, or where the Agreement is a three-party Agreement involving the funder, the University and the staff member or student (researcher).The R&E Office is the primary point of contact for communications with funders relating to contractual matters. Although researchers are likely to communicate independently with funders on a variety of subjects, any communications relating to contractual matters must go through the R&E Office.An Agreement is normally forwarded to the University by the funder when a decision has been made to purchase research or provide funding for non-exchange research. If a researcher (staff member or student) receives an Agreement directly, they are required to pass it onto the R&E Office in a timely manner.The Agreement is read, reviewed and negotiated by the R&E Office in consultation with the Lead Principal Investigator and/or other researcher(s) as appropriate.The final Agreement is signed by a representative of the funder and the DVC R&E or their delegated authority on behalf of the University.\n5. Contractual Obligations\nThe University of Otago (not individual staff) is the binding signatory on all Agreements and, as such, is required to ensure that any report(s) or product(s) are delivered in accordance with the Agreement.All reports required by the funder must be prepared by the Lead Principal Investigator in consultation with the appropriate R&E staff member and submitted to the R&E Office two weeks ahead of the due date stated in the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed. The R&E Office, where appropriate, will submit the report to the funder.The named Lead Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the research is undertaken in accordance with all ethical and regulatory requirements, University of Otago policies and procedures, the budget determined in the application and the contractual obligations of the Agreement. If the terms of the Agreement are breached \u2013 for any reason \u2013 the Lead Principal Investigator must immediately notify the R&E Office. Where the Lead Principal Investigator is unable to fulfil these responsibilities, their HoD will notify R&E of a suitably qualified alternate to ensure the University's obligations are met.Due to the dynamic and changeable nature of research, alterations to the protocols, procedures, timelines, milestones, objectives, etc. contained in the original Agreement may sometimes be necessary. Any changes to Agreements must be notified to the R&E Office by the Lead Principal Investigator (or their HoD) and negotiated with the funder by the R&E Office before execution by the DVC R&E or their delegated authority.",

        "name": "Working_From_Home_Policy",
        "scope": "All University employees.",
        "content": "1. General principles\nFlexible working arrangements, including work from home, are important in helping to attract and retain a productive workforce and support employee wellbeing.The University of Otago is committed to the maintenance of its unique campus-based learning and working environment and therefore it is vitally important that staff are available for students on campus and are able to interact effectively with colleagues.The University recognises that people have become more adept at working from home and have overcome many of the associated technological and other challenges. This policy provides new opportunities for staff to manage their work commitments more flexibly and for the University to make better use of its teaching and office space.Staff working in different areas of the University all make unique and important contributions to the success of the University. The variation in roles means that options to work from home are also variable, with some work being able to be completed fully from home and other roles needing to be fully on campus. Similarly, variability in staff members' personal circumstances mean that some staff cannot access the provisions of this Policy. As much as is practicable, staff will have equitable access to this Policy.Changes to working arrangements, such as entering into informal or formal working from home agreements, are a good time for staff to consider how they travel to and from campus on days they do not work from home.\n2. General approach\nThe University encourages staff and Managers/Heads of Department ( HoD s) to discuss individually and collectively, whether staff working from home is desirable and feasible for their area. Managers and HoD s are encouraged to be as flexible as possible without unduly affecting the performance of their area.All new buildings projects and major refurbishments will consider, during the design of the works, working from home options in order to reduce space requirements.Where staff are working from home for more than 2 days per week for a period of greater than four months, the HoD /Manager is expected to consider the efficient and effective use of office space.Where working from home arrangements are made, staff must be able to work effectively and have an appropriate work environment. This includes the ability to ensure information is kept secure and that all health and safety requirements are met. Recordkeeping requirements must also be maintained, and information created in a work context and held off-site returned to the University for storage and/or secure destruction, if employment ceasesConsideration must be given to the Working from Home Guidelines.Staff are also able to make a formal request for flexible work arrangements (under the Employment Relations Act) in accordance with the University's Flexible Working Request Procedure.The University reserves the right, following review and consultation, to cease any WFH agreement.\n3. Applications to work from home\nApplications to work from home will be managed in accordance with the Flexible Working Request Procedure. There are three pathways \u2013 informal, semi-formal and formal; the requirements for each are described below.Informal process The informal process is an arrangement with a Manager/ HoD and is used when staff are infrequently working from home (a day a week or less) or working from home for short periods (less than four months), for any amount of time.No formal documentation is required; however, it is recommended that a record of the arrangements (such as an email) is retained.The University is not expected to fund any home office equipment or set up.Semi-formal process The semi-formal process is used if the arrangement is for an extended period (more than 4 months) and/or is for substantial hours of work (more than a day a week).Requests will be made using the Request for Flexible Working Request Form and must be accompanied by a Working from Home Health and Safety Checklist.Managers/ HoD s will take the Working from Home Guidelines into consideration when reviewing these requests.All semi-formal arrangements should contain a review period. The review timeframe will depend on the circumstances but in most cases six months would be reasonable.Formal process A formal process is required under the Employment Relations Act.Formal requests will be considered as outlined in section 4 of the Flexible Working Request Procedure.\n4. Working from Home due to Unforeseen Circumstances\nWhere staff are required to work from home due to unforeseen circumstances and/or circumstances outside of the University's control, the University will consider the support and measures that are appropriate at the time, on a case-by-case basis.\n5. Health and safety\nWhen working from home, the home becomes the workplace and the usual health and safety policies and requirements apply to the University and staff.A self-assessment of the home office must be completed by the staff member when ongoing working from home is being contemplated. Occupational Health are available for support and advice as required: Occupational HealthEmail ohn@otago.ac.nzAll incidents and accidents, that happen in the course of carrying out work at home, need to be reported in the usual manner: University of Otago Health and Safety web portalACC will continue to apply to staff working from home, however only injuries sustained while carrying out work will be accepted as workplace injuries.",

The entire 'Working_From_Home_Policy' could be condensed into a few sections that outline the general principles, approach, and key considerations for working from home.\n2. Separate policies or procedures documents should be created for the Flexible Working Request Procedure and the Request for Flexible Working Request Form to provide clear instructions on how to make a request for flexible working arrangements.\n\nAdditionally, some parts of the policy seem to be missing clear sections that would typically be present in other policies:\n\n1. There is no section that outlines the specific criteria or guidelines for determining whether an employee's role requires them to be on campus or can be done from home.\n2. The policy does not explicitly outline what happens if a staff member is required to work from home due to unforeseen circumstances outside of their control.\n\nOverall, while there are some redundancy and structural flaws identified in the provided policy data, it appears that the policy itself is comprehensive and covers most aspects of working from home arrangements.

The Chief Digital Officer will approve exceptions.Mobile device holders must always operate mobile devices safely and legally.Mobile device holders must take all practical steps to avoid loss or damage to their mobile device(s).The mobile device holder is responsible for the security of the University data stored on the mobile device.Mobile devices must be locked when not in use by using a PIN, password, biometrics or other such security functionality.Usage of all mobile devices on the University mobile plan will be monitored.All mobile devices on the University mobile plan must be configured to connect to the University's WiFi network.The University may install software and configure its mobile devices for the purposes of security, recovery of devices and compliance with licensing obligations.University mobile device holders must report, as soon as possible, the loss/theft of a mobile device. When this is: within normal business hours, report the loss/theft to AskOtago.outside of normal business hours, report the loss/theft directly to the approved mobile service provider in order to block voice, SMS and/or data usage on the mobile device account.Any university data stored on a mobile device remains the property of the University of Otago and may be subject to internal investigation or disclosure by the University under freedom of information legislation (the Official Information Act and the Privacy Act), or in the course of the discovery process if there is litigation in progress. Those using the mobile device should therefore be aware that there are situations where the University may be legally required to disclose information within its power or control, and that it cannot guarantee the complete protection of personal information stored on University devices.\n4. Costs\nThe mobile device holder is responsible for all costs incurred on their mobile device.Costs arising from the personal use of chargeable services which are not included in the University's mobile plan such as 0900, audioconferencing, PXT, competition TXT etc shall be reimbursed by the mobile device holder.Costs arising from excessive personal data usage shall be reimbursed by the mobile device holder.The University may initiate action to recover any personal-use costs from the mobile device holder.\n5. Return, transfer or disposal\nOn cessation of employment with the University, a mobile device holder must return all University mobile device(s), complete with SIM card and additional accessories to their supervisor/manager. The mobile device sponsor must notify AskOtago in order for the appropriate action to be taken in regard to the University mobile account associated with the device(s).University mobile devices and telephone numbers remain the property of the University. Exceptions to this must be approved by the Chief Digital Officer.If a mobile device on the University mobile plan transfers to another mobile device holder or cost centre within the University, AskOtago must be advised of the new details.All data on a mobile device must be securely erased before the device is transferred to another staff member.Old or unwanted University mobile devices must be returned to Information Technology Services for disposal.When the relationship with the University ceases, all university data must be securely removed from external mobile devices.\n6. Non-compliance\nThe device holder may face disciplinary action and/or their eligibility for a mobile device may be revoked.",
        "q1_response": "After reviewing the policy document, I have identified the following policies that contain unnecessary content, specifically cross-references to other policies:\n\n1. Section 3.2: \"External mobile devices may be able to use the University mobile plan with the approval of the Chief Digital Officer on the condition that the University may install software and configure the external mobile device for the purposes of security, recovery of devices and compliance with licensing obligations.\" - This section is redundant as it simply reiterates policy 3.1.\n\n2. Section 4.6: \"The University may initiate action to recover any personal-use costs from the mobile device holder.\" - This section seems out of place as it appears to be a reference back to policy 4, but the language used suggests that this is more related to policy 11 (Non-compliance) or another non-existent policy.\n\n3. Section 5.1: \"University mobile devices and telephone numbers remain the property of the University.\" - This statement seems like a repetition of information already covered in section 6 (Non-compliance).\n\nThese sections appear to be unnecessary as they either reiterate existing policies or seem unrelated to the current topic being discussed.",
        "q2_response": "Based on the provided policy document, I have identified three procedures that contain instructions on how to do something, rather than rules or principles:\n\n1. Section 3: \"Usage and security\" contains several sections with instructions on:\n\t* Operating mobile devices safely and legally\n\t* Taking steps to avoid loss or damage to mobile devices\n\t* Reporting losses or thefts of mobile devices\n\tThese sections appear to be procedures for mobile device usage and security.\n\n2. Section 4: \"Costs\" contains several sections with instructions on:\n\t* Reimbursing personal-use costs from chargeable services\n\t* Recovering personal-use costs from mobile device holders\n\t* Initiating action to recover personal-use costs\n\nThese sections appear to be procedures for managing costs related to mobile devices.\n\n3. Section 5: \"Return, transfer or disposal\" contains several sections with instructions on:\n\t* Returning mobile devices upon cessation of employment\n\t* Erasing data from transferred devices\n\t* Returning old or unwanted devices for disposal\n\nThese sections appear to be procedures for managing the lifecycle of mobile devices within the University.\n\nNote that while these sections may contain some policy language, their primary purpose appears to be instructional and procedural in nature.",
        "q3_response": "After reviewing the provided policy document, I have identified the following policies that contain inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. **Inconsistent naming conventions**: The policy names are not consistent with standard naming conventions used by organizations. For example, \"Mobile_Device_Policy\" could be shortened to \"MobileDevicePolicy\".\n\n2. **Repetitive language**: Some sections repeat similar information, making the document seem redundant. For instance, Section 5.1 is essentially a restatement of Section 6 (Non-compliance).\n\n3. **Outdated or unnecessary sections**: The policy appears to be missing some critical sections that are present in other policies, such as \"Mobile Device Configuration\" and \"Acceptable Mobile Devices\". The mention of these sections in the content but not having dedicated sections for them suggests an incomplete policy document.\n\n4. **Inadequate documentation for exceptions**: Some sections (e.g., Section 3.1 and Section 5.2) mention procedures for handling exceptions, but do not provide clear guidelines or protocols for when these exceptions should be applied.\n\n5. **Potential security vulnerabilities**: The policy seems to neglect the need for encrypting sensitive information on mobile devices. It is unclear whether employees are expected to use encryption software to protect their personal and work-related data stored on the device.\n\n6. **Insufficient clarity on ownership**: While Section 1 provides some insight into who owns University-provided devices, it would be beneficial to explicitly state this in other sections of the policy to avoid potential misunderstandings about ownership.\n\nOverall, while the policy document seems comprehensive, there are opportunities for improvement in terms of consistency, clarity, and completeness.",
        "q4_response": "Based on your analysis, here is a list of redundancy or incorrect structures of policies:\n\n1. **Repetition**: Section 5.1 states that \"University mobile devices and telephone numbers remain the property of the University.\" which seems to be redundant as it's already mentioned in Section 6 (Non-compliance) with similar wording.\n2. **Outdated information**: The policy document mentions the need for employees to report losses or thefts directly to IT services, but there is no clear process or contact information provided for reporting incidents. It would be beneficial to include this information in a dedicated section of the policy.\n3. **Lack of clarity on exceptions**: Some sections (e.g., Section 3.1 and Section 5.2) mention procedures for handling exceptions, but do not provide clear guidelines or protocols for when these exceptions should be applied. It would be beneficial to include specific examples or criteria for determining whether an exception should be made.\n4. **Inconsistent naming conventions**: The policy names are not consistent with standard naming conventions used by organizations. For example, \"Mobile_Device_Policy\" could be shortened to \"MobileDevicePolicy\".\n5. **Missing sections**: The policy appears to be missing some critical sections that are present in other policies, such as \"Mobile Device Configuration\" and \"Acceptable Mobile Devices\".

It is unclear whether employees are expected to use encryption software to protect their personal and work-related data stored on the device.\n\nAdditionally, some suggestions for improvement could be:\n\n1. Use a more standardized naming convention for policies.\n2. Include clear guidelines or protocols for handling exceptions in relevant sections of the policy.\n3. Consider adding a dedicated section for mobile device configuration or acceptable devices.\n4. Clearly state ownership and responsibilities for University-provided devices throughout the policy.\n5. Provide guidance on encrypting sensitive information on mobile devices, if applicable.\n\nOverall, while the policy document seems comprehensive, there are opportunities for improvement in terms of consistency, clarity, and completeness."

        "content": "Compliance Management FrameworkThe University of Otago is committed to complying with all laws, agreements, standards, codes and obligations relating to its operations and governance. In particular, the University recognises its obligation to its students, staff, and the wider community, to promote a positive compliance culture.The University has therefore adopted a methodology consistent with the Compliance Management Systems standard (ISO 37301:2021) for identifying, assessing and managing its compliance obligations. This methodology is the basis of the University of Otago's Compliance Management Framework. It applies to both academic and service divisions and considers a broad range of operational, governance, quality, academic and financial compliance obligation.The framework operates on the following principles: Outsourcing of operations or activities does not relieve the University of its compliance obligations. The standard that would be required for any outsourcing arrangement will be the same as that for the University itself.Compliance activities are integrated with other University functions such as governance, risk management, and internal audit.Compliance obligations are embedded into University-wide policies, processes, procedures and practices.To help ensure its activities are objective, the compliance function is independent of the operations to which compliance obligations apply.Responsibility for ComplianceThe University Council has overall responsibility for compliance with laws, regulations and Council approved policies and in exercising this function delegates: Responsibility for oversight of compliance management activities to its Audit and Risk Committee, andResponsibility for the implementation of the Compliance Management Framework to the Vice-Chancellor.The Audit and Risk Committee will: Provide oversight to compliance management activities across the University and its controlled entities and monitor the implementation of remedial actions to minimise or eliminate noncompliance risk, andReport at least quarterly to the Council on the performance of compliance management activities (this may form part of a broader report on the work of the Committee).The Vice-Chancellor is responsible for: Communicating signi\ufb01cant actual or potential compliance breaches to the Council and the Audit and Risk Committee as appropriate, andDelegates responsibility for ensuring that compliance management practices are established and maintained in accordance with this policy to the Chief Operating O\ufb03cer.The Chief Operating O\ufb03cer has: Delegated authority to ensure that compliance management practices are established and maintained and that support and guidance is provided to the University community,Responsibility for the operational management of compliance management practices University- wide, andEnsures governance mechanisms effectively monitor compliance and the way in which compliance obligations are managed.Senior Managers (DVCs, PVCs, Deans, Head of Departments, Directors) are responsible for: Recognition and disclosure of actual or potential noncompliance in their areas of responsibility.Identifying existing and emerging laws and regulations applicable to their area of responsibility on an ongoing basis.Maintaining and updating the Register of Compliance Obligations in accordance with the University-wide Compliance Management Framework.Reporting regularly to the Vice-Chancellor on compliance - immediately in instances where significant actual or potential noncompliance is identified.Ensuring that compliance risks are assessed for any new (or significantly altered) activity for which they are responsible.Ensuring that noncompliance and noncompliant behaviours are dealt with appropriately.Making training opportunities in compliance available to staff as appropriate to their position and role.The Head of Risk, Assurance and Compliance is responsible for: Promoting and facilitating the implementation of formal processes to identify, assess, record and communicate compliance obligations and compliance risks,The ongoing development of the Compliance Management Framework,Continuously monitoring action undertaken by the University to address significant instances of noncompliance, andProviding guidance and assistance to senior management and staff in fulfilling the responsibilities defined in this policy.All other management and supervisory staff are accountable for the timely and proactive provision of information to all those mentioned in (a) to (f) above which will allow those responsible for managing actual or potential noncompliance in particular areas, to carry out their tasks in the most informed manner possible.",

It would be better to use clear headings or sections to break up the content and remove unnecessary cross-references.\n\n2. The policy mentions that Boards of Controlled Entities are responsible for establishing their own compliance policy, framework, and processes, but it does not provide any guidance on how this should be done. This could lead to inconsistencies in compliance management across different areas of the University.\n\n3. The policy states that senior managers are responsible for recognizing and disclosing actual or potential noncompliance in their areas of responsibility, but it does not specify what steps they should take if they identify noncompliance. Providing clear guidance on this would help ensure consistency in reporting and addressing noncompliance.\n\n4. The policy mentions that training opportunities in compliance should be made available to staff as appropriate to their position and role, but it does not provide any details on how this should be organized or implemented. Clarifying the process for providing compliance training would help ensure consistency across the University.\n\n5. Some policies may contain redundant or unnecessary information. For example, a policy might mention that certain procedures are in place to address noncompliance, when in fact, these procedures are already outlined in other policies.\n\n6. The policies do not explicitly state what consequences will be faced by staff who fail to comply with the policy requirements. Providing clear guidance on this would help ensure accountability and consistency across the University.\n\n7. There is a lack of standardization in terms of language and terminology used throughout the policies. This could lead to confusion and inconsistencies in implementation. It may be helpful to establish a consistent tone and language style across all policies.\n\n8. Some policies might benefit from being rewritten as procedures, rather than policies. For example, if there are specific steps that need to be taken in response to noncompliance, these would be better suited as procedures rather than policies.\n\n9. There is no explicit policy on how to address or resolve conflicts of interest arising from compliance issues. Providing clear guidance on this would help ensure consistency and fairness across the University.\n\n10. The policies do not explicitly state what will happen if a senior manager fails to report noncompliance in their area of responsibility as required by the policy. Providing clear guidance on this would help ensure accountability and consistency across the University.",

Clear guidance on this should be provided to ensure accountability.\n\n5. **Lack of standardization in procedures**: Some policies might benefit from being rewritten as procedures, such as steps taken in response to noncompliance.\n\n6. **Insufficient guidance on addressing conflicts of interest**: There is no explicit policy on how to address or resolve conflicts of interest arising from compliance issues. Clear guidance on this would ensure consistency and fairness across the University.\n\n7. **Unclear reporting requirements for senior managers**: The policy mentions that senior managers are responsible for recognizing and disclosing actual or potential noncompliance, but it does not specify what steps they should take if they identify noncompliance.\n\n8. **No clear process for providing compliance training**: Clarifying the process for providing compliance training would help ensure consistency across the University.\n\n9. **No explicit policy on handling failed reporting by senior managers**: Providing clear guidance on this would ensure accountability and consistency across the University.\n\n10. **Gaps in addressing conflicts of interest**: The policies do not explicitly address how to handle situations where there may be a conflict of interest arising from compliance issues. Clear guidance on this should be provided to ensure fairness and consistency."

        "content": "1. General Principles\nThe University of Otago will, as far as reasonably practicable, take steps to provide a safe environment for staff, visitors and contractors in fieldwork and off campus work locations.The Fieldwork and Off Campus guidelines are the minimum standard for compliance.Staff and students are only permitted to bring children on field activities with the express permission from the relevant Head of Department. The Head of Department must authorise a plan that satisfactorily meets the requirements of adequate supervision and safety of the child and be satisfied that emergency management and field activities will not be compromised by the child being present during the field/off campus activity.\n2. Responsibilities\nThe University of Otago as a PCBU is responsible for: The provision of resources to enable the University of Otago to meet all of its obligations in the area of health and safety management in fieldwork and work conducted off campus.Ensuring that the Officers of the University are held accountable for the following of the fieldwork policy and guidelines to meet the HASAW 2015 requirements.Senior Managers (Pro-Vice-Chancellors/Deans/Directors/COO/DVCs) have a duty of care to: Provide adequate resources for the division to meet the compliance requirements of the fieldwork/off campus policy and guidelines for department within their division.Authorise and approve fieldwork plans as appropriate when escalated by a Head of Department/Manager.Heads of Academic Departments, Research Centres, Heads of College and Heads/Managers/Directors of Service Divisions have a duty of care to: Provide adequate resources for compliance with the fieldwork policy and guidelines for their area of responsibility.Consider the occupational health and safety implications of proposed fieldwork activities at the planning stage.Review and consider all field activity plans prior to any field trip taking place.Escalate field activity plans to the relevant Senior Manager (see 2(b) above) for authorisation where the risks are considered significant.Monitor the effectiveness of compliance with the policy and guideline requirements.Ensure staff and students receive the appropriate information, instruction and training necessary, and adequate supervision, to safely perform their work or studies respectively.Ensure that their department has a planned programme of identification, assessment, and control of hazards and risks, and that field activities met the legislative requirements and policy objectives.Fieldwork Leaders / Activity Coordinators have a duty of care to: Identify and assess the hazards/risks associated with the proposed fieldwork activity at the planning stage and that appropriate control measures are put in place to eliminate or minimise such hazards/risks.Ensure a documented field safety/risk management plan is completed for each field trip and submitted to the HOD/Manager/Director for authorisation prior to the fieldwork commencing.Ensure that effective means of communication are maintained in the field for emergency response, and that for remote fieldwork that the fieldwork plan is lodged with Campus Watch to allow for emergency response.Ensure all staff, students and volunteers are instructed in safe and healthy working procedures, warned about particular hazards and advised how to avoid, eliminate or minimise risks of such hazards.Monitor the implementation of the safety plan in the field.Fieldwork participants are required to: Read any notices, attend any briefings and return any forms that are required to the Activity Coordinator.Seek instruction/clarification if they are unsure of anything they are required to do.Comply with instructions and directions issued by their supervisor and the fieldwork leaderReport any unsafe conditions or hazards to the field leader.Be familiar with emergency and evacuation procedures and the location of first aid kits, personnel and emergency equipment and if appropriate, trained to use the emergency equipment.",

It may be helpful to consolidate or clarify these responsibilities to avoid duplication.\n\n4. **Lack of clarity on escalation procedures**: While the policy mentions that Senior Managers should authorise and approve fieldwork plans, it does not provide clear guidance on what happens if a Senior Manager is unavailable or unwilling to make a decision. This lack of clarity may lead to delays or confusion in the fieldwork approval process.\n\nOverall, while the policy appears to be comprehensive, there are some areas where redundancy or clarification could improve its structure and effectiveness."

        "scope": "This applies to all car-parks on the University of Otago Dunedin campus, including Residential Colleges.",
        "content": "GeneralThe University provides car parks in order to assist the smooth functioning of the University, and to help manage the environmental effects of parking on the campus and surrounding neighbourhood. There is no obligation to provide all staff or any particular individual with a car park, except that where possible parks will be provided for staff and students with mobility-related impairments and for new parents.Eligibility and Waiting ListUniversity car parks are available by way of licence to University staff, students, departments, staff of University subsidiaries, and, at the discretion of Property Services, may be made available to tenants of University buildings and/or other external users.Due to demand for parking, Property Services will maintain a waiting list of people wanting a park on campus, with preferred locations(s) stated for each applicant.\u00a0\u00a0Parks will generally be offered, as they become available, to those who have been on the waiting list the longest time, taking into account any preferences for location.\u00a0\u00a0Normally, priority is given to staff and departments, but exceptions may be made in order to provide parks under Clauses 6 and 8 below, or on the approval of the Vice-Chancellor or Director of Human Resources.Only one park per individual is available.Where parks are temporarily lost due to a construction project, the affected licence holders will be offered alternative parking if available in the interim, and will be offered their original parks back when they are returned to service.\u00a0\u00a0Where parks are permanently lost due to construction, the affected licence holders will have priority on the waiting list for a new park.Visitor ParkingThe University has limited parking available for visitors.University departments may lease parks from the University for visitor use, and access to these is administered by those departments. Any such allocations are subject to a signed declaration from the Head of Department stating that the park will not be used for staff parking.Parks for visitors not directly related to a specific department are provided by Property Services (Albany Street) and the Office of the Registrar and Secretary to Council (Clocktower Building).Visitor parks are not available to students, unless arranged with the relevant department or division.Service Car ParksProperty Services will maintain adequate parking for service vehicles on University of Otago campuses.Service parks are available only for University contractors and Property Services vehicles on University business. These parks are time-limited.Service parks are to be used only when it is not feasible to park off-campus, and then only for the time required to perform duties such as delivering materials that cannot be easily transported across campus by foot, or where the vehicle is fitted with plant that is required for the work at hand.Vehicle Tow-awayLicensees of University car-parks have exclusive use of their park between the hours of 7:30am and 5:30pm Monday to Friday. Any person parking in a space where they do not have a licence to do so during these hours can expect their vehicle to be removed at their own expense.Unauthorised use of parks designed for service, visitors or mobility parking, or parking on areas of the campus that are not marked for car parking may result in the vehicle being removed at the owner's expense.Property Services is responsible for arranging for the removal of unauthorized vehicles from parking spaces or any other part of the campus. Car park licensees must not arrange for a vehicle to be towed, and should contact Property Services to request the removal of a vehicle (contact parking@otago.ac.nz).Otago Campus New Parents Car ParkingA number of car parks will be reserved for the use of individuals returning from parental leave or who have joined the workforce with childcare commitments. The car parks will be located in the north, centre and south of the Dunedin campus and, wherever possible, will be covered.As the number of these car parks is limited, they will be available on a first-come, first-served basis for a minimum of three months and a maximum of one year. At times, there may be higher demand than availability of the parks, and in these circumstances, priority will be given to the parent who has the most need. This may mean priority for the individual who has the youngest child or child with special or high needs. These parks will be available in the first instance to parents of children under 24 months.If no parks are available close to the individual's work location, then existing lease holders may be approached and offered relocation to a temporary park for the duration of the New Parent's lease.The allocated holder of the car park will be entitled to the car park for the minimum three-month period. The cost of the car park is set at the standard uncovered rate even if the car park is covered.To apply for a New Parents car park space, individuals should complete the online waiting list application form via the Property Services website http://www.propserv.otago.ac.nz/. Expecting parents may apply for a New Parent park within the two months prior to going on maternity leave.Extended Leave (parental, study, research and sabbatical)Allocated car parks may be sub-let to another University staff member whilst the holder is on extended leave. The car park licensee must advise Property Services of their wish to sub-let the park. In the first instance, Property Services will offer the sub-lease of the park to applicants on the waiting list. If no applicants can be found, the licensee may find a sub-lessee. The person sub-leasing the park must complete and sign the licence agreement and any other relevant paper work. The sub-lessee will be responsible for the parking fee for the duration of the sub-lease. The park may be sub-let to University of Otago staff only, with the proviso that the park is returned to the holder upon their return from extended leave.Mobility ParkingMobility parks are provided for the use of students and visitors with mobility-related impairments, and are clearly marked as such. The parks are not for the use of staff with impairments, as they can use leased parks as set out below, in 8 (f) and (g).University mobility parks are available for use by University of Otago mobility parking permit holders only. Permits are issued to students with a demonstrated need for mobility parking. Applicants should provide either a valid CCS Disability Action Mobility Parking Permit and/or a letter written by a relevant professional that supports the use of a University mobility park. Permits are issued by the Disability Information and Support (DI&S) office and applicants will be required to sign a code of practice.Mobility parks are free of charge to users, and access is on a first-come first-served basis.In all instances, a University mobility parking permit is to be displayed on the dashboard of vehicles using mobility parks.Any vehicle parked in a DI&S mobility park and not displaying the appropriate DI&S parking permit will be towed away at the owner's expense.Staff with a temporary mobility impairment (eg recovering from surgery) are able to lease a University car park at the standard rate for the term of the recovery period (as stated on the medical certificate or ACC certificate). If no parks are available close to the individual's work location, then existing lease holders may be approached and offered relocation to a temporary park for the duration of the temporary lease.University of Otago staff members with permanent mobility impairments are able to lease a park at the standard rate. Property Services will source a suitable park and priority will be given over others on the waiting list if the applicant can provide a letter from a relevant professional supporting the need for a park close to the applicant's place of work and if the applicant meets the following requirements: Unable to walk and rely on a wheelchair for mobility, orRely on mobility devices (e.g. crutches, walking sticks, walking frame), orUnable to walk more than 200 metres unassisted because of the nature or severity of the impairment.Property Services, in consultation with the Disability Information & Support Office, will regularly review the number and location of mobility parks.Management of parksProperty Services is responsible for the development, control, management and maintenance of all University parking areas except for those at the University's residential colleges, which are administered by the respective colleges.Property Services will charge a parking fee for all parks. Visitor parks will be charged to the Department that requests the visitor park. Similarly, service parks will be charged to Property Services, and mobility parks will be charged to the Disability Information and Support Service.Parking fees will be reviewed on an annual basis and will take into account market rents applying in the campus area. The Vice-Chancellor will set parking fees taking into account advice from Property Services.",

Class representative volunteers self-register on the OUSA class representative database, which generates a report for each Department of representative names and corresponding papers. Alternatively, Departments can enter representative names directly into the OUSA class representative database.The OUSA invites all class representatives to attend an introductory training session on the responsibilities of class representatives, effective communication, and the OUSA's and other support services available at the University of Otago.The OUSA maintains contact with class representatives through regular newsletters providing information on upcoming events, training and volunteer opportunities. Representatives also have the opportunity to participate in the OUSA's Educom Committee.The OUSA maintains regular contact with Departments to share information about its training and professional development opportunities for representatives and to ensure the system is functioning effectively.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Role and Responsibilities of Departments\nThe Head of each Department has responsibility for ensuring that representatives for student groups within their department are appointed.\u00a0\u00a0Usually there shall be one representative per paper, but this may be varied based on class sizes; for example a year-level, programme or postgraduate representative may be appointed where student numbers are smaller, or multiple representatives may be appointed in large papers.Each semester Departments shall ensure the names and contact details of class representatives are readily accessible to students, for example through publication on webpages, Blackboard and/or departmental noticeboards.Departments are encouraged to maintain regular contact with their class representatives, for example through regular meetings.Where appropriate, Heads of Departments are to take steps to recognise the value of the involvement of class representatives, for example through morning tea or lunch time meetings or the inclusion of class representatives in appropriate departmental occasions.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Role and Responsibility of Divisions\nEach academic Division, in consultation with the appropriate student body and the OUSA, is responsible for developing processes for ensuring and monitoring the consistent implementation of a class representative system within that Division.",

The Operator, Sector Manager, Head of Department ( HOD ) and the IBSC will be copied into all correspondence with respect to this notification.The Operator may withdraw the Approved User status.If the Approved User status is withdrawn the BCO , IBSC , Sector Manager, and HOD will be notified.Any reinstatement of Approved User status will be considered by the Operator, IBSC , Sector Manager and BCO following discussions with the Approved User and the HOD involved.Additional Management strategies: If Approved User status is withdrawn, responsibility for materials and new organisms (includes genetically modified micro-organisms/unwanted organisms and uncleared (risk) biological products) that must be held in the facility must be transferred to another Approved User or the materials destroyed at the time status is withdrawn.",
        "q1_response": "Based on the provided policy data, I have identified a few policies that contain unnecessary content such as cross-references to other policies:\n\n1. The phrase \"see clause 1(c) below\" in the section for minor infringements of containment controls can be removed and replaced with the actual text from clause 1(c). This is not necessary as it provides an external reference instead of including the relevant information directly.\n\n2. In the same section, the mention of 'clause 1(c)' appears multiple times; this should ideally be referred to directly in the policy document or included in a cross-reference table for easier access and understanding.",
        "q2_response": "Based on the provided policy data, I have identified two parts that contain procedures rather than policies:\n\n1. The section for minor infringements of containment controls contains steps such as:\n   - Notification to the Sector Manager via Vault or in the case of vertebrate laboratory animal infringements notification via Vault to the Approved User with concurrent notification to the Sector Manager.\n   - Written explanation from the Approved User or Sector Manager regarding the reasons for the infringement and remedial action to prevent a repeat.\n   - Additional training and/or additional audits by the IBSC as decided by the BCO and the IBSC Chair.\n\nThese steps are procedural instructions on how to handle minor infringements, making it a procedure rather than a policy.\n\n2. The section for major infringements of containment controls also contains procedures such as:\n   - Notification to the Approved User, the IBSC, the Operator, Sector Manager, and the Head of Department by the BCO.\n   - Written explanation from the Approved User regarding the reasons for the infringement and remedial action to prevent a repeat.\n   - Additional training and/or additional audits by the IBSC as decided by the Operator in consultation with the BCO and appropriate members of the IBSC.\n\nThese steps are procedural instructions on how to handle major infringements, making it a procedure rather than a policy.",
        "q3_response": "Based on the provided policy data, here are the policies that contain inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. **Lack of clear procedures for handling minor and major infringements**: The policy documents procedures for handling minor and major infringements, but these procedures can be considered as separate policies rather than being part of the main policy document.\n\n2. **Cross-references to other policies (redundant)**: There are instances where cross-references to other policies (e.g., \"see clause 1(c) below\") can be removed and replaced with the actual text from that clause or included in a cross-reference table for easier access and understanding.\n\n3. **Separation of responsibilities**: The policy does not clearly define who is responsible for certain tasks, such as notifying the BCO, IBSC, Animal Practices and Compliance Officer (for vertebrate laboratory animal infringements), the Operator, and the Head of Department when corrective actions are complete.\n\n4. **Lack of clear definitions for key terms**: The policy uses technical terms like \"minor infringement\" and \"major infringement,\" but their definitions are not explicitly stated in the policy document.\n\n5. **Unnecessary repetition**: There is repetitive language and structure throughout the policy, which can make it difficult to read and understand.",
        "q4_response": "After reviewing the provided policy data, I have identified several redundancy or incorrect structures of policy:\n\n1. **Redundant cross-references**: As mentioned in q2_response, there are instances where cross-references to other policies (e.g., \"see clause 1(c) below\") can be removed and replaced with the actual text from that clause or included in a cross-reference table for easier access and understanding.\n\n2. **Procedural instructions vs. policy statements**: As mentioned in q2_response, certain sections of the policy contain procedural instructions on how to handle minor and major infringements, which should be considered as separate policies rather than being part of the main policy document.\n\n3. **Lack of clear procedures for handling minor and major infringements**: The policy documents procedures for handling minor and major infringements, but these procedures can be considered as separate policies rather than being part of the main policy document.\n\n4. **Separation of responsibilities**: The policy does not clearly define who is responsible for certain tasks, such as notifying the BCO, IBSC, Animal Practices and Compliance Officer (for vertebrate laboratory animal infringements), the Operator, and the Head of Department when corrective actions are complete.

This could be achieved by reorganizing the content or breaking up long paragraphs into shorter ones.\n\n7. **Duplicate notifications**: In some sections of the policy, there are duplicate notifications (e.g., notification to the Approved User and notification to the Sector Manager via Vault), which can be condensed into a single notification to avoid repetition.\n\n8. **Procedure for handling withdrawn status**: The policy does not explicitly state how the Operator will handle the situation when an Approved User's status is withdrawn, such as whether they need to notify anyone else or what steps will be taken to revoke access.\n\n9. **Cross-references to other policies (not fully utilized)**: While cross-references are used in some parts of the policy, not all relevant policies are referenced. It would be beneficial to include a comprehensive list of references for easier understanding and compliance.\n\n10. **Repetition of similar language**: There is repeated use of similar phrases throughout the policy, such as \"written explanation\" or \"remedial action.\" These phrases can be condensed or rephrased for clarity and concision.\n\nOverall, while the policy provides a good foundation, it would benefit from some revisions to improve its structure, clarity, and consistency."

        "name": "Conflicts_of_Interest_Policy",
        "scope": "This policy applies to:\nall University of Otago staff members,any independent contractors to the University, andUniversity Council members.",
        "content": "1. A Conflict of Interest (or potential Conflict of Interest) occurs when any of the following apply:\nA person is in a position to derive personal benefit from actions or decisions made in their official capacity.A person's responsibilities are, or could be affected by some other personal, financial or academic interest or duty. This can include staff-staff or staff-student relationships as referenced in the Ethical Behaviour Policy, or family members or close friends benefiting from the official responsibilities undertaken by a person in their official capacity.A person's activities outside their employment with the University lead, or could lead, to material benefit for the person concerned, either directly or indirectly, to the detriment, or potential detriment, of the University.A person's activities interfere, or could interfere, with the fulfilment of their employment obligations.\n2. The following principles guide how a Conflict of Interest should be identified and managed:\nAt all times people acting on behalf of the University must behave and be seen to behave in an impartial and transparent manner.The existence of a perceived or potential Conflict of Interest does not necessarily imply wrongdoing on the part of any person. However, any interests which could give rise to a potential Conflict of Interest must be promptly disclosed and managed and documented, in accordance with this policy as though they were an actual Conflict of Interest.Members of the University community must consider how an impartial observer might reasonably perceive a potential Conflict of Interest situation or relationship, whether or not any wrongdoing is involved.Managers and supervisors need to be alert to situations in which they, or the people that they manage or supervise, may have a Conflict of Interest and ensure that the situation is recognised and handled appropriately.If a person has any doubt as to whether a potential Conflict of Interest exists, they must disclose the matter to their Manager.The Ethical Behaviour Policy applies in the event that a Conflict of Interest arises from a staff-staff or staff-student relationship (including a family relationship).Potential Conflict of Interest may raise complex issues. Staff members, and their Managers or supervisors must judge each situation that arises in a prudent manner.Disclosure of potential Conflict of Interest may involve disclosing personal information. This information must be handled with due regard to the privacy of all individuals concerned and in accordance with the Privacy Policy and any applicable privacy statement.If a person has a potential Conflict of Interest in a matter under consideration, they must not take part in any discussion or decision on the matter giving rise to the conflict, unless the chair/relevant manager or supervisor decides otherwise.Where a person has a direct or indirect financial (excluding super funds managed by independent 3rd parties) interest in a matter being considered, they must not take part in any decision about the matter unless authorised to do so.Individuals who do not comply with the University requirements regarding the management of potential Conflict of Interest, as described in this policy, or other University policies or procedures, may be subject to disciplinary action.\n3. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest\nConflict of Interest must be dealt with quickly and transparently.Council members and senior staff will be asked to disclose Conflict of Interest on a regular basis.Any person involved in a procurement process will be asked to disclose Conflict of Interest as part of the procurement process.Other Conflicts of Interest: Where a staff member considers a Conflict of Interest may exist, they must disclose this in writing to their manager.Where the manager determines that a Conflict of Interest exists, or is perceived to exist, the manager will acknowledge the Conflict of Interest and either: Authorise the staff member in writing to continue in their current duties, orPut in place additional processes to ensure the impartiality of the staff member in performing their duties and advise the staff member in writing of these processes, orRe-organise the duties of the staff member to remove the Conflict of Interest and document the changes made, orReport the matter to the Vice-Chancellor for determination of appropriate action.The record of the decision made in relation to a disclosed Conflict of Interest under this policy must be lodged in the Conflicts of Interest Register, which is maintained by the Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance. The Manager is responsible for ensuring that the Conflict of Interest is recorded in the Conflicts of Interest Register and that the relevant divisional head is advised.\n4. Common Forms of Conflict of Interest\nThe following tables outlines the most common forms of Conflict of Interest along with any additional approvals required (in the case of staff members only), or policies which should also be consulted.\nType Must be disclosed under this policy VC Approval Required Divisional Head Approval Required Additional Requirements Link to other policyEthical conflict with staff member's professional code of conduct or code of professional ethics \n      \n         Yes \n      \n         No \n      \n         No \n      \u00a0\n         Ethical Behaviour Policy \n      Commercial Appointments, i.e., Company Directorships, Partnerships or Advisory relationship to commercial organisations which do or could conduct business with the University \n      \n         Yes \n      \n         Yes \n      \n         Yes \n      \n         Must be reviewed every two years or whenever the commercial appointment is renewed. \n      \u00a0Company Shareholding An interest must be declared where a person (or close family member) has an interest in a company.

        "q1_response": "After analyzing the provided policy data, I found one policy document that contains unnecessary content in the form of cross-references to other policies (though not explicitly stated as \"cross-references,\" they are implicit due to the use of phrases like \"and also consult\" or \"in accordance with\"). \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, this is more accurately described as a need for additional information rather than explicit cross-references. That being said:\n\nOne potential issue lies in policy '4', where it references other policies and documents, but doesn't explicitly state how to access them. For instance, under \"Acceptance of Gifts, Benefits and Gratuities Policy\", it mentions that documentation is maintained by the Procurement Office but does not provide a clear link to this document or explain how to access it.\n\nThis lack of clarity could be seen as unnecessary content, as it may cause confusion for staff members who need to navigate these policies.",
        "q2_response": "Based on the provided policy data, I found one policy that contains parts that are actually Procedures (e.g., instructions on how to do something) rather than Rules or Principles:\n\n* The 'Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest' section (section 3). This part provides specific steps for managing potential conflicts of interest, such as authorizing staff members to continue in their current duties, putting in place additional processes to ensure impartiality, reorganizing the staff member's duties, and reporting the matter to the Vice-Chancellor. These instructions are procedural in nature, outlining how to handle specific situations.\n\nWhile this section does contain some general principles (e.g., disclosure must be made quickly and transparently), its primary focus is on providing step-by-step guidance for handling conflicts of interest, making it a procedure rather than a policy.",
        "q3_response": "After reviewing the provided policy data, I found the following policies that contain inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. Conflicts of Interest Policy (Section 3: Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest) - This section contains procedural instructions on how to handle potential conflicts of interest, which makes it a procedure rather than a policy.\n2. Conflicts of Interest Policy (Section 4) - Some sections in Section 4 seem to be procedures or guidelines for specific situations, such as \"Commercial Appointments\" and \"Acceptance of Gifts, Benefits and Gratuities Policy\". While these are important, they could be considered separate documents or procedures rather than part of the Conflicts of Interest Policy.\n3. No clear issues found in other sections of the policy.\n\nNote that the only clear issue is with Section 3: Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest, which seems to blend procedural and policy elements. The rest of the sections seem to be more consistent in their structure and tone as policies.",
        "q4_response": "The provided policy data appears to be a draft or an incomplete document, as it contains several unresolved issues, inconsistencies, and unclear references. Here's a summary of the main problems:\n\n1. **Cross-references**: The document contains implicit cross-references to other policies (e.g., \"and also consult\" or \"in accordance with\"), which could cause confusion for staff members who need to navigate these policies.\n2. **Procedural vs. policy content**: Some sections, such as Section 3: Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest, contain procedural instructions that are not typical of a policy document. This blurs the line between procedures and policies.\n3. **Lack of clarity**: Certain sections, like \"Acceptance of Gifts, Benefits and Gratuities Policy\", do not provide clear links to related documents or explain how to access them, which could lead to confusion.\n\nTo address these issues, it's recommended that:\n\n1. The cross-references be explicitly stated as such, providing a clear link to the relevant policies.\n2. Section 3: Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest be rewritten to clearly distinguish between procedural and policy content.\n3. Additional information or instructions be provided for unclear sections, such as \"Acceptance of Gifts, Benefits and Gratuities Policy\".\n4. The document be reviewed and revised to ensure consistency in structure and tone throughout.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the Conflicts of Interest Policy can become a more comprehensive, clear, and effective document that provides guidance for staff members on managing potential conflicts of interest."
