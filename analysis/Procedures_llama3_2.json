        "content": "IntroductionSales revenue is derived through either a cash sale or a credit sale. A cash sale results in the collection of cash at the time of the sale. A credit sale results in an invoice being created and given or sent to the purchaser who will then send payment back at a later date. Wherever possible cash sales should be made for the following reasons: Cash in the bank earns interest incomeCredit sales incur costs in creating and distributing invoices and statementsSome credit sales result in non-payment or are very difficult to recover resulting in significant costs being incurredCash payments can be made by EFTPOS and credit card.Existing debtor accountsIn order to make a Credit sale a Debtor Account must be used, if the University has previously allowed credit to the purchaser then an account will exist. A list of all debtor accounts is available by accessing the Debtor Chart within Finance One.All Debtors Accounts that have not had any activity for more than 13 months are made status \u201cInactive\u201d. This means no transactions can be put against the account.To reactivate the Debtor account, a new AR Account Application form must be completed to ensure the correct details are recorded. Where the transaction is a \u201cone-off\u201d and the value is less than five thousand dollars (NZ$5,000) then an appropriate Sundry Debtor Account within Finance One may be used.An account number must be entered onto the invoice at the time of the sale.New debtor accountsAll new Debtor accounts require a new AR Account Application form to be completed. Departments and Academic Units who regularly request invoices be raised for less than $100 should investigate the option of establishing a web-based sale interface that accepts credit card payments as this is the most cost-effective way to process high volume low value transactions. Where a pattern of regular but relatively low value transactions is likely then a new Debtors Account should be established to process these, rather than using a Sundry Debtors account as this aids the collection of outstanding amounts.To request a new Debtor account, Departments are required to complete  a new AR Account Application  form. This form completed and signed by the Debtor is essential in order to properly manage the collection process, in the event that the debt becomes overdue.Maintenance of debtor accountsThe Revenue Management Office is responsible for the maintenance of the debtors account list. Where no transactions have been entered against a debtor account in the previous 13 months the account will be made inactive and the procedures for the creation of a new account will apply.Creation of an invoiceAn invoice is required in all circumstances where a cash sale is not made.Invoices must be created using Finance One.Credit NotesCredit Notes are used to cancel invoices either in whole or part (only issue a partial Credit Note if a part payment has been made).They are not to be used to write off uncollectable debts.Legitimate uses include the correction of errors in the original invoice, to account for the return of goods or to amend a disputed price.Because GST is paid by the University to the IRD as soon as a GST invoice is issued it is important that any credit notes be issued promptly.Credit Notes must be created using Finance One.Debt collectionThe Revenue Management Office manages the collection of debt in the University. For any one debtor numerous departments may issue numerous invoices in any one month.These invoices, along with any payments received, will be summarised onto a debtor statement which is emailed to the debtor monthly.The collection action adopted by the Revenue Management Office is based on the length of time an invoice has been outstanding, measured in months since issue Current \u2013 A Debtor Statement is sent to the debtor at the end of the beginning of the following month. University policy is all invoices on these Statements are to be paid by the 20th of the month following (normal commercial practice).One month \u2013 The debtor is sent a statement clearly noting \u201cOVERDUE ACCOUNT\u201d.Two months \u2013 The Debtor Statement (i.e. 60 days overdue) \u201cFINAL NOTICE\u201d statement is sent.Three months \u2013 At the end of the month when the account is 90 days overdue, a debt collection letter is sent. The letter clearly states that no further credit will be granted and that the debt will be sent for debt collection unless there is a legitimate reason as to why the account should remain unpaid. No further invoices should be issued to a debtor with invoices outstanding for this period. The Department which issued the invoice is notified that the debt remains unpaid and is asked for their assistance in recovering the debt. The Department is also advised that the debt will be passed for debt collection and is asked to advise immediately if this course of action is not warranted, if no response is received regarding outstanding invoices, the outstanding amount will be debited back to the Department which will reduce their income. The account will be passed to the collection agency, the debtor will be liable for all costs associated with collecting the debt.Write off of unrecoverable debtDebt cannot be written off without prior approval in writing from the Chief Financial Officer.Applications for write off should be forwarded to receivables@otago.ac.nz setting out the details of the invoices and the circumstances surrounding the request.",

The necessary correction would be to remove or rephrase cross-references that appear within the words of the policy itself.\n\nThe only instance where a cross-reference appears is in sections 3, 5, and 6. Specifically:\n\n* In section 3, the cross-reference \"Financial Delegations Policy\" appears twice.\n* In section 5, there is a cross-reference to the same \"Financial Delegations Policy\".\n* In section 6, there is no direct cross-reference but referencing \"section\" number (6) would be better rephrased.\n\nTo improve clarity and readability, it might be helpful to:\n\n1.

        "content": "The University of Otago's Adverse Weather Conditions Guidelines state that In the event of adverse weather conditions (such as snow, ice or floods) it is expected that the University will remain open and staff are expected to undertake all reasonable and safe steps to attend and work. As the attendance of academic staff can be affected in these circumstances, some lectures may not be held. It is important that students receive timely notification of any cancellations and/or any other relevant information. The University's Procedures for the giving of advice to students about teaching activities scheduled for days affected by snow are:\nIn situations where the University's activities are affected by snow a general statement will appear on the University website's homepage and on the Current Students' page. The decision to activate that notice will be made by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and conveyed to the Director of Communications for implementation. That statement will refer students to Blackboard for information about lectures and other teaching activities. The same statement will also be available to students on the Facebook and Twitter sites managed by AskOtago.Heads of Department are responsible for ensuring that advice on each affected day's scheduled teaching activities in their departments is accessible and provided in a timely manner. It is expected that, where possible, lectures will proceed and no departmental closures will occur.The advice to students is to be posted on Blackboard which will be consistent with the statement on the web homepage. Where a paper is not on Blackboard, the Lecturer in charge of that paper is responsible for ensuring the students are advised of an alternative information mechanism in advance.The information is to be available on Blackboard (and any other relevant services) at least an hour before the scheduled lecture or other teaching activity.Where a lecture occurs on an affected day but some students cannot attend and that non attendance is legitimate given the adverse weather conditions, the Lecturer must make suitable arrangements for the absent students to receive all the course material relevant to the missed lecture.During snow conditions final examinations will be held as scheduled. Students are expected to make appropriate arrangements to ensure they can attend their examinations without putting themselves at risk. More information is available at: http://www.otago.ac.nz/study/exams/otago029434.html#snow. If students are unable to travel to the University to sit their examinations because of road closures or hazardous driving conditions, they should contact AskOtago for advice.",

        "name": "Purchase_Card_Procedure",
        "scope": "This procedure applies to the University and its subsidiaries.",
        "content": "1. Issue of Purchase Cards\nPurchase Cards are available to staff who have a genuine need for one. To be eligible for a Purchase Card, an employee must be a University of Otago staff member and meet at least one of the following criteria: Travel frequently in the course of their dutiesTravel overseas in the course of their dutiesPurchase single, non-recurring purchases from a supplier not already within UnimarketIncur regular expenses of a kind appropriately paid for by a Purchase CardPurchase small value or infrequently purchased itemA Purchase Card should not be used where the University has established specific procurement arrangements for certain goods and services with preferred or mandatory suppliers that do not anticipate the use of Purchase Cards. Examples of this include the purchase of stationery via UniMarket and the purchase of air travel which should be made via the University's mandatory travel agents, and the subscription to mobile phone accounts which should be made through the University\u2019s agreement with One NZ .Prospective applicants, their immediate supervisor and delegated administrators completing Purchase Card coding on behalf of a cardholder are required to have read/completed all relevant trainings prior to a Purchase Card being issued. Required reading and training include: Sensitive Expenditure VideoUser Guide for coders and cardholders (PDF)Declaration of Expense \u2013 Lost Receipt Form (PDF)After successful completion of the required reading and training, the Purchase Card Application Form must be completed, signed by the applicant, their Manager or Head of Department ( HOD ), and the Pcard Administrator.Note that in signing an application for the issue of a Purchase Card, the HOD is deemed to have given financial delegation/authority for expenditure approval to the cardholder and the applicant's supervisor agrees to review and sign all Purchase Card statements on a monthly basis.\n2. Distribution of Purchase Cards\nThe issuing bank will forward the Purchase Card directly to the Accounts Payable team. The Pcard Administrator will contact the applicant who will be required to collect the card in person (photo ID is required).The applicant will also receive an email with all relevant links to the Policy and Procedures, including the Purchase Card User Guide. If the applicant is located outside of Dunedin, the purchase card will be couriered.The Purchase Card can be used from the commencement date printed on the face of the card. The cardholder must visit an ANZ bank branch to add a PIN (4 digit number) to the Purchase Card, photo identification will be required. The PIN selected should be unique to this Purchase Card i.e. should not be the same number as other cards and\u00a0\u00a0should be kept confidential to the cardholder. PIN numbers should never be disclosed to anyone or written down.\n3. Purchase Card limits\nEach Purchase Card will be issued with a monthly credit limit of either $2,500, $5,000 or $10,000. If a different limit under $10,000 is required, this will be approved by the Pcard Administrator on a case-by-case basis.If a credit limit higher than $10,000 is required, approval resides with the Chief Financial Officer. All requests should clearly state the reasons for the higher limit.Credit limits will be reviewed on a regular basis, and where a Purchase Card is being operated well below the assigned limit, that limit may be reduced at the discretion of the Purchase Card Administrator with agreement by the cardholder's HOD or Manager.Temporary limit increases may be applied for as and when required by emailing the Pcard Administrator with authoriser's approval, the value of increase and the length of time required.\n4. Use of the Purchase Card\nThe Purchase Card can be used at any location displaying the Visa brand.The Purchase Card must only be used by the individual staff member to whom it is issued. Under no circumstances should the details of a Purchase Card be shared with another person or the Purchase Card be used by another person on the holder's behalf as per Visa policy.Purchase Cards should not be used as departmental cards by several members of staff.Expenditure charged to Purchase Cards must be business-related. It must be reasonable, appropriate and in accordance with the University's policies and procedures related to expenditure. In particular, cardholders should be familiar with the Travel and Travel Related Costs Policy.Where expenditure is incurred on behalf of a number of cardholders, and one of the cardholders is the supervisor of the other cardholders, then the expenditure must be charged to the Purchase Card of the supervisor (the \u2018one-up\u2019 principle).A Purchase Card may be used to make purchases over the phone or internet. To reflect good security practices, such purchases should only be from established reputable companies known to the University. Purchase Card details should only be entered on an identified secure web site.Note: Staff should be cautious and refrain, where possible, from purchasing from global online retailers for equipment and goods on the basis that there is very little support available when there is an issue with either the purchase or when the product is in use (non-delivery, incorrect item, warranty issue, product quality, etc).Goods purchased online or by phone using a PCard should always be delivered to a University address unless prior approval from a HOD has been obtained. Approval (e.g. email) should be attached to the transaction in Finance One along with the appropriate invoice/receipt.A Purchase Card should not be used where the University has established specific procurement arrangements for certain goods and services with preferred or mandatory suppliers that do not anticipate the use of Purchase Cards. Examples of this include the purchase of stationery via UniMarket and the purchase of air travel which should be made via the University's mandatory travel agents, and the subscription to mobile phone accounts which should be made through the University\u2019s agreement with One NZ .When travelling to China staff will need to link their Pcard to a Mobile Payment platform App. Please contact the Pcard Administrator who will provide you with the most current App to use. On return to New Zealand, the Pcard must be un-linked from the App.\n5. Disputed transactions\nDisputed transactions must be resolved with either the supplier or the issuing bank by the cardholder. If the issuing bank suspects a fraudulent transaction, they will contact the cardholder via text or email/phone the Pcard administrator to investigate with the cardholder.If the cardholder is unable to contact the supplier, they must complete the ANZ Disputes Form and contact the Pcard Administrator so that the bank can be advised immediately that the transaction is being disputed. ANZ Disputes Form (PDF)The transaction must be coded as \u201cin dispute\u201d in the Finance One PCard module, and remain so until the issue has been resolved.\n6. Cash advances\nPurchase Cards will only be issued with a cash advance facility if the cardholder has indicated the intention to travel overseas, although such a facility may be provided to other cardholders on request to the Pcard Administrator. Each request should contain a full explanation of the reason for needing to access cash advances.Where a cash advance facility is provided, the use of the facility must comply with the following:\nDrawing cash within New Zealand is not permitted unless the cardholder is away from their home campus at the time the cash is required.Approved koha for UOW or UOC may be withdrawn using Pcard, with approval from the Office of M\u0101ori Development provided as supporting documentation for the transaction.Approved Pacific Gifting for UOW or UOC may be withdrawn using Pcard, with approval from Divisional Pacific Leaders and/or the Pacific Development Office provided as supporting documentation for the transaction.Prior to withdrawing cash, the cardholder should exhaust all other options of payment including using the standard Purchase Card functionality.Cash withdrawn must be accounted for in the same manner as all other expenditure, including the attachment of appropriate supporting documentation.Unspent cash should be converted back to NZ currency, banked into the University bank account, and coded to the Finance One ledger account used for the original cash withdrawal. Evidence of this deposit should be included with the Purchase Card monthly statement.In the event that unspent cash cannot be converted back to NZ currency, such as coins or an uneconomic amount, then the cash should be returned to the Cashiers team, Financial Services Division.\n7. Expenditure documentation\nConsistent with any purchase on behalf of the University, expenditure must be supported by appropriate documentation. Tax invoices must be supplied for NZ expenditure in excess of $50.00. Appropriate invoices and/or receipts must be supplied for all foreign purchases. Invoices and/or receipts must be legible and itemised.A lost receipt form must be completed for all missing receipts over $50 detailing each item of expenditure.The requirements of a valid tax invoice issued by a New Zealand organisation can be found under the heading \u201cUniversity Expenditure \u2013 Claiming GST From Invoices Received\u201d within the University of Otago Taxation Guidance.\n8. Coding of Purchase Card Transactions\nPurchase Card transactions will be loaded into the Finance One Pcard Module on a regular basis using an import file provided by the bank.The principal coder for that card will receive a reminder email alerting them to the fact that there are outstanding transactions to be coded.It is the cardholder\u2019s or designated administrator\u2019s responsibility to monitor and appropriately code all Purchase Card transactions. Coding needs to be completed by noon on the first working day of each month following the transaction date. If the purchase card holder is traveling for longer than 30 days at a time, an exception may be granted to allow additional time to complete this task. If an exception is given, the cardholder will receive an email from the Pcard Administrator confirming the revised due date.Coding of Purchase Card transactions is actioned within the Finance One OU My PCard Module. The process includes identifying any applicable New Zealand GST, inclusion of suitable comments supporting each transaction and a summarised narration for finance reports.Note that both the supporting comments and ledger narrations will appear on the monthly Purchase Card statement. It is important that they include sufficient detail to substantiate each transaction.Further information relating to this process can be found in the Purchase Card User Guide.\n9. Monthly Purchase Card statements\nOn the first business day of each month, cardholders will be emailed a statement showing the previous month\u2019s Purchase Card transactions. This statement should be reviewed and signed by the cardholder, declaring that \u201cthe information contained on this form is correct and the expenses incurred were for business purposes in accordance with the University of Otago Purchase Card Policy\u201d. Under no circumstances should a Purchase Card statement be signed on behalf of the cardholder \u2013 only the cardholder can make the above declaration.The Purchase Card Statement must be authorised by the cardholder\u2019s supervisor. The supervisor must record their name and position on the statement. In all cases, this review and authorisation should be performed by a person senior to the cardholder. This is known as the \u201cOne-up\u201d principle and should always be applied.If a Purchase Card Statement contains expenditure relating to the supervisor, then it should be referred to a higher authority for approval.The signed and approved Purchase Card Statement, along with all original supporting documentation must be forwarded to pcard.admin@otago.ac.nz by the date specified on the statement. If possible, each invoice/receipt should be scanned and attached to the appropriate transaction row within Finance One.\n10. Lost or stolen cards\nPurchase Cards are valuable and should be treated in the same way as a passport or cash.If a Purchase Card is lost or stolen during working hours, the cardholder must contact ANZ and the Pcard Administrator immediately. The administrator will arrange for the Purchase Card to be cancelled and a replacement issued.\u00a0\u00a0If the Purchase Card is lost of stolen outside normal working hours, the cardholder must contact ANZ bank immediately to arrange for the card to be cancelled and then contact the Pcard Administrator to advise the loss and initiate arrangements for a replacement card.ANZ Bank Contact details are: In New Zealand call 0800 888 111 From overseas call collect +64 9 914 8026 The ANZ bank is liable for all charges incurred on the account once they have been advised of the lost card.In the event the lost Purchase Card is subsequently found by the cardholder, it should be destroyed as it will no longer be valid as a replacement card has been issued.\n11. Audit\nAn audit of Purchase Card transactions will be performed on a regular basis by the Office of Risk, Assurance and Compliance and may be sample selected annually by external auditors as part of the annual accounts audit process.If a cardholder is suspected of misusing their Purchase Card, the details will be reported to the cardholder\u2019s HOD, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Financial Controller for comment and/or resolution.\n12.

        "name": "Travel_Planning_Procedure",
        "scope": "These procedures apply to all staff, students and Council members of the University of Otago and all staff in controlled entities where they are travelling at the cost of the University of Otago or its controlled entities, and all other bookings made by the University of Otago.",
        "content": "Please note that this document is currently under review.\n1.Travel Risk\nAs detailed in the Insurance Procedure, the University of Otago has subscribed to an international security and medical alert advisory service, Healix Travel Oracle.\u00a0\u00a0Travellers are strongly encouraged to install the Healix Travel Oracle App and select and read the Healix Travel information associated with the countries they are planning to travel to.Healix Travel Oracle App guide (PDF) - requires staff loginAll Domestic and International travel purchased through the MTA is loaded into the University's Travel Tracker programme (Healix) which allows the University and its insurers to know where staff or other University representatives are in the event of an emergency.\n2.Staff Travel Approvals\nBefore booking travel, staff should ensure that they have obtained the necessary approvals as required by their respective divisional travel approval process.\n3.Booking Air Travel\nThose approving air travel should ensure that travel is necessary given the impact air travel has on climate change, as well as the financial implications.Staff should ensure they book air travel via the most economical air travel class and route (in line with current policy requirements) in order to minimise the overall cost of travel to the University.All air travel should be booked through the MTA .All bookings made through a MTA must be made using a University Purchase Order for off-line bookings and include the appropriate GL/PL account code for on-line bookings.Travellers and travel bookers are encouraged to use the MTA online tools, where appropriate, to make their bookings to avoid any undue delay in the booking process.\n4.Land Travel\n4.1 Booking Land Travel\nLand Travel includes rental cars/taxis/trains/buses and ride sharing applications such as Uber.Land travel (including connections) may be booked as follows: Domestic via an MTA or be directly booked with the service provider subject to the conditions below.International via an MTA except as provided at section 6 below.\nNote: When using an MTA , bookings should be made at the same time as any associated flight bookings to avoid additional MTA fees.\n4.2Rental Cars\nRental car bookings (not being made in conjunction with Air Bookings) can be booked using the University's approved supplier(s) in the first instance, using either the supplier's web reservation system (with payment made via the travellers' PCard) or via the University's MTA (which can be charged back to the University via the MTA 's consolidated invoice). Rental car bookings required in conjunction with Air Travel bookings should be booked via the MTA at the same time as the respective flight bookings.To reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions staff should select the lowest emissions option suitable for their journey. This should include consideration of Electric Vehicles ( EV s) where available. When considering EV s, the total cost of fuel/charging and rental should be used when comparing costs.No direct bookings (quoting a University Purchase order) for rental cars are to be made that would be directly invoiced back to the University.Where the approved supplier is unable to meet the booking requirement, the next most cost effective supplier should be used.When hiring a rental car, staff or other University representatives should not select the pre-paid fuel tank option as there is no credit applied for any un-used fuel remaining in the vehicle at the end of the hire period. To avoid a refuelling service charge, including higher fuel cost, staff or other University representatives should ensure the rental car fuel tank is full before returning it to the car rental company.If staff wish to use their private vehicle in lieu of a rental car, they should first familiarise themselves with section 7 of the Travel and Travel Related costs policy.\n4.3Taxis, Shuttles and Shared Ride Apps\nThe use of Taxi, shuttles and ride apps is permitted to be pre-booked or obtained as required directly with the service provider or via the MTA .Bookings for these services must be made noting the requirements in Section's 7 & 8 of the Travel and Travel Related costs policy.\n4.4Other\nFor all land travel, including road or rail, staff should use the best available pricing on the day.\n5.Booking Accommodation\nAccommodation can be booked (in order of preference): Using an MTA (as part of an overall travel booking for Domestic and International Travel). When arranging a booking, travellers are free to specify the required standard of accommodation to the MTA ;Directly with an accommodation provider, when: The booking is for domestic travel only;There is no associated air travel component to the itinerary;The booking can made using a recognised internet reservation system (eg trivago, booking.com) or directly with the accommodationThe payment for the accommodation will be via PCardAll 'Airbnb for work' bookings must be made through the MTA .\u00a0\u00a0A PCard cannot be used to pay for AirBnB as these bookings must be made via an MTA . To initiate an AirBnB for work booking: Go to https://www.airbnb.co.nz/workEnter your 'firstname.surname@otago.ac.nz' email address and follow the prompts to register with the University of Otago AirBnB AccountSearch for properties that are suitable for your needs based on the following minimum selection criteria: Type of Place: \u201cEntire Place\u201dAmenities: Has a \u201cSmoke Alarm\u201dUser rating of 4.5 or aboveEmail the link for the property to your University Travel Agent to book the property on your behalf and add it to your travel itineraryFor locations where AirBnB properties with the minimum criteria options are not available, AirBnB properties may only be used on the specific prior approval of the University Health and Safety Manager on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of this approval will be required to be provided to the Travel agent to enable them to make the booking.\n6.Arranging Travel during period of RSL\nIt is recognised that where staff are on extended periods of RSL , it is often impractical to efficiently book incidental intra-continental travel via the MTA . Staff on RSL are free to book (and use their PCard for payment for) short-term/internal travel associated with their RSL provided: The staff member has downloaded the Oracle Travel App and has \u201cwatch-listed\u201d the countries they are intending to travel to.  To do this: Open the Travel Oracle AppClick into the 'Country Profile' sectionScroll to and 'select' the country you are intending to visitSelect 'Watch Country' box located at the bottom of the screenThe requirement for this ancillary travel was not identified/required at the time the initial RSL travel bookings were made with the University Travel Agent.\n7.Associated Private Travel\nWhere private travel is undertaken in conjunction with University business travel, or where family members or other non-business associates accompany staff members or University representatives on University business, the private part of the air travel and/or accommodation must be disclosed at the time the reservation is made and will be charged separately by the MTA . Private travel at discounted rates is not offered by all the airlines under the AoG agreement. Staff members or other University representatives should check with the MTA s prior to making a booking.Private travel or related costs are not to be charged to the University. This includes the charging of private travel costs to the University which is subsequently reimbursed by the staff member, or other University representatives. Any variation to this instruction requires the prior approval of the Chief Financial Officer.\n8.Insurance\nAll persons travelling internationally (including Australia and the Pacific Islands) on University business must have approved travel insurance.\u00a0\u00a0See the Insurance Procedure for more information.For vehicle rentals within New Zealand, staff or other University representatives are to decline the rental agency's insurance cover when hiring vehicles for Otago University business purposes.\u00a0\u00a0The University maintains insurance policies that provide coverage for the hire of rental vehicles used for University business purposes within New Zealand.Where a vehicle is hired outside New Zealand, staff or other University representatives must purchase comprehensive vehicle insurance from the rental agency. As not all hire contracts are structured the same, the staff member or other University representative must ask the rental agency to confirm that the insurance includes vehicle damage, third party, and public liability cover. Staff or University representatives should not pay an increased premium to secure an excess below NZ$6,000 (the University travel insurance policy will cover an excess up to this amount).Any questions regarding travel or vehicle insurance should be directed to Travel Insurance bookings, Divisional Services and Administration: Email travel.insurance@otago.ac.nz",

        "name": "Convening_of_Doctoral_Examinations_without_an_Oral_Examination_Procedure",
        "scope": "This procedure applies to all doctoral thesis examinations without an oral examination. The Doctoral of Clinical Dentistry degree does not require an oral examination, the Doctor of Education degree usually does not require an oral, and the Doctor of Philosophy degree may not require an oral only if the candidate began study before 2014.",
        "content": " 1.Induction into convening\nConveners are normally more senior academic staff and must have some experience examining Doctoral theses. Conveners are nominated by the Head of the supervising department, and approval is given by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Graduate Research School.The Convener must complete a brief (5 minutes) training session on eVision processes for convening via Blackboard in order to gain access to examination management in eVision. Before convening their first examination, conveners are strongly recommended to attend a workshop for Conveners of Doctoral examinations provided by the Graduate Research School.New conveners are added into the convener database (linked below), and are sent a resource pack with detailed information about the convening process, including template emails for liaising with examiners.List of PhD Conveners of examiners (PDF)\n2.Nomination and approval to convene a Doctoral examination\nA Convener should be approached informally by the primary supervisor or Head of the supervising department, to determine their availability and willingness to act as a convener for a specific examination.Having confirmed availability, convener details are entered by the Administrator in the supervising department into the 'Nomination of Examiner' form in eVision. Following approval, once the examination begins, conveners are advised by an alert from eVision that provides details of the candidate and examiners, as well as links to key examination policies. They are asked to confirm that there is no conflict of interest in convening the examination, and acknowledge that any information received is given in confidence for use solely in relation to assessment of the thesis. In a separate email they are sent a link to a digital copy of the thesis and a Convener Recommendation Form.\n3. Receiving supervisors' and examiners' reports\nAdministrators in Student Experience receive supervisors' and examiners' reports directly, and will upload and enter the results in eVision. The Convener will receive a notification via eVision as each report is entered.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener receives reports directly from the supervisors or examiners, these should be emailed to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing.\u00a0\u00a0Administrators and/or the Dean of the Graduate Research School will follow up on any late reports, but may enlist the assistance of the Convener.The supervisors' report is for the Convener's information in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0It should not be circulated before the examiners' reports have been received. In the interests of facilitating an examination result, and providing the supervisors' report contains relevant context, the Convener may wish to make this report available to the examiners after all three examiners' reports have been submitted. The candidate does not normally receive a copy of the supervisor's report at any stage in the examination process.The examiners should report independently on the thesis; the content of the independent reports should not be shared amongst the examiners until all three reports are received.\u00a0\u00a0 Occasionally a substandard report (in terms of length, tone or language) may be received.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener is concerned about the quality of the report, they should confer with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who may request a revised report from the examiner.\n4. Facilitating the reaching of consensus on a result\nThe Convener is responsible for facilitating a consensus amongst the examiners on the result of the examination and any required amendments.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the Convener may need to take on an adjudicating role in order to assist this process, for example through assessing the evidence being presented by examiners' for their positions, but at no time should the Convener become involved in judging the quality of the thesis itself (this is the role of the examiners).Possible outcomes from the examination are recommendations that the thesis: be accepted as is, and the degree be awarded;be accepted with minor editorial corrections, and the degree be awarded;be accepted and the degree be awarded after amendments have been made to the satisfaction of the Convener of examiners in consultation with the internal examiner;be revised and resubmitted for examination;be rejected and referred to the appropriate authority within the University for consideration of the award of another degree; or,be rejected with no right of resubmission.The following steps may be taken to reach a consensus: circulating the examiners' reports and outlining the available options and/or a possible way forward;discussing the situation individually with one or all of the examiners, or chairing an audio or web conference with all the examiners;in exceptional circumstances, following consultation with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, seeking clarification from the supervisor(s) about specific aspects of the thesis. For example, the thesis may contain co-authored published material and the examiners may want clarification over the contribution of the candidate and the co-authors.A decision should also be made on whether the examiners recommend the thesis be nominated for 'exceptional' status (in the top 10% of theses examined).\u00a0\u00a0Such a recommendation requires that all three examiners agree that the thesis is of exceptional quality, which may be demonstrated through initial examiner recommendations or through written examiner statements confirming this recommendation following discussion.\u00a0\u00a0Each examiner should provide brief written reasons for their judgment that the thesis is exceptional.If a consensus on a result cannot be reached, the Convener should contact the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who will advise on next steps, for example the appointment of a referee.Once consensus is reached, the Convener should draft a letter for the candidate, containing the result and required amendments, and circulate this around the examiners for final confirmation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notifying the result\nThe Convener should email the recommendation for the result on the prescribed form, along with a letter to the candidate (see 4(f) above), to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing. The Administrators in Student Experience will send this letter to the candidate with copies to the primary supervisor.For an 'Accept' result (see 4(b)I, ii and iii) the Administrators at Student Experience will formally advise the candidate of the result via an alert from eVision; the Convener's letter and the examiners' reports will be sent to the candidate and copied to the primary supervisor.\u00a0\u00a0The Convener may also inform the candidate of the result prior to formal notification being sent.For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 4(b)iv,) the Dean of the Graduate Research School will normally liaise with the candidate's primary supervisor, who shall inform the candidate of the result in person.\u00a0\u00a0 The Convener's letter and anonymised copies of examiners' reports will be emailed to the primary supervisor to share with the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, and the head of the supervising department.\u00a0\u00a0This process is intended to provide additional support to the candidate.For a 'Reject' result (see 4(b) v and vi) the Dean of the Graduate Research School shall manage communications to the candidate.\u00a0\u00a0The result letter, the Convener's letter and copies of examiners' reports will be provided to the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, the Primary Supervisor and the head of the supervising department. The candidate will also be advised of the process to seek leave to appeal.Where the result includes amendments or revisions, the Convener should be available to the candidate to provide clarification on the nature and scope of additional work required.A candidate has the right to seek leave to appeal if they believe there has been an unfair examination process.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approving the required corrections or amendments\nFor an 'Accept' result (see 4(b)ii and iii), the Convener is responsible for ensuring that any required corrections or amendments have been completed. For this result the candidate should submit the corrected thesis directly to the Convener. The Convener should confirm with the candidate the format in which they would prefer the amended thesis (electronic, hard copy or both).For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 4(b)iv), the thesis will be fully re-examined, preferably with the same examiners and Convener; in this case the candidate will work on revisions under the guidance of their supervisor(s) and the candidate should submit their revised thesis and a separate summary of changes made to phd@otago.ac.nz; the Convener will not be required until the thesis is resubmitted.Where minor corrections are required (see 4(b)ii), the Convener is solely responsible for checking that these have been made.Where amendments are required (see 4(b)iii), the Convener is responsible for checking that these have been made in consultation with the internal examiner. Note that the internal examiner is expected to check that the amendments agreed to by the examination panel are addressed; any specific concerns of the internal examiner should not be given undue weight in this process.Once any corrections or amendments required by the examiners have been completed and the Convener is happy that all amendments have been made, an email should be sent to phd@otago.ac.nz with the following text and the Administrators at Student Experience will enter the result and upload the email to eVision. Please ensure that it is a separate email and not a reply, as the document will be uploaded to eVision as a permanent record:\"All amendments have been satisfactorily completed by NAME (ID) and my recommendation is that the degree can now be awarded.\"The Convener may also inform the candidate of the result prior to formal notification being sent.",

        "name": "Administration_of_Externally_Funded_Research_Procedures",
        "scope": "These procedures apply to:\nUniversity of Otago staff and students engaged in externally funded researchNon-University of Otago staff applying for external funding to be hosted by the University of OtagoUniversity of Otago Research and Enterprise (R&E) staff and other professional staff engaged in the support of externally funded research.",
        "content": "1. Applications for Externally Funded Research\nApplication forms and guidelines from various funding bodies are available from the R&E Office or directly from the funding body, either in hard copy or in electronic form on the website. If not immediately available, the R&E Office will try to obtain the appropriate forms.Up-to-date information about closing dates and other relevant information is provided fortnightly on the Research page of the University's web site and is circulated by email to all interested research staff at the University.An application or formal proposal for external research funding binds the University to fair and accurate representations of its research capacity and the ability of its employees to undertake lawful research investigations. The University discharges that duty by requiring employees to make a declaration within the Costing and Consents Worksheet (CCW).The CCW, and supporting documentation indicating how to provide the financial information required for a funding application, are available from the R&E Office website (as above). Please note that the CCW is an internal document only and is not to be forwarded to any external organisation.The Lead Principal Investigator is responsible for setting up the CCW. R&E staff will review the CCW once it is complete.Checklist for submitting applications for externally funded research: Copy of the application, signed by the applicant (normally the Lead Principal Investigator), and HoD, Dean or other authorised office holder of the University if requested by the funder;University of Otago CCW (including copies of ethical/regulatory approvals where applicable), signed by applicant, HoD, Dean or PVC (where appropriate) and relevant R&E staff member (as specified under Approval Delegations, below);Once the research funding application is compiled and ready for submission, the R&E Office will obtain the appropriate University of Otago authorisation and will submit the application to the funder on behalf of the applicant. Final submission will be in accordance with funding body and University requirements.\n2. Costing\nAll externally funded research must be fully costed, using the CCW, to define the true cost of undertaking the research, identify any profit margin that might be reasonable to be added for the provision of the research service, and minimise the need for cross subsidisation from other funding sources. Costing must be approved by the R&E Office before being quoted to the funder.Full costing will be based on the application of the University of Otago's current costing methodology as determined by DVC R&E. An explanation of costing principles is available on the R&E website.Costing of time for dedicated research and professional staff time FTE will use up-to-date academic and professional staff salary or hourly-rate schedules, with provision for annual progression and cost-of-living adjustments, available through the R&E Office. The resourcing of professional staff support for externally funded research must comply with the principles and authorities outlined in the University's Professional Staff Appointment Policy.The price offered to the funder will normally be the greater of the market value of the research activity or the full cost as calculated under (a) in order to maintain and protect the financial viability of the University. All applied price calculations must also adhere to the funder's guidelines/ regulations/ terms of reference.Any negotiation around costing with the funder must be handled by the R&E Office.The full cost of research must be identified in the CCW, even in situations where the University decides not to recover the full cost of the research in setting its price.While full cost recovery is desirable, the University recognises the need for flexibility in applying costing principles to externally funded research so as to match the needs and circumstances of the various funders, the University's strategic goals and the nature of the research.The undertaking of a research project at less than full cost should only occur after careful consideration of the factors involved.Examples of cases that may merit external funding at less than full cost are projects where the funder purchases specialised equipment that will remain the property of the University at the conclusion of the project, co-investment in projects that support the charitable purpose of the University, projects that directly support the teaching mission of the University, or projects that are pilot investigations for large fully-funded projects.Any, and all, costing and pricing documentation is internal to the University and must not be forwarded to the funder or any other party without permission from the DVC R&E or their delegated authority.The researcher must get approval for budgets from their HoD and the appropriate R&E Office staff prior to providing any costings to external parties (for example, funders and collaborators), with such approval being recorded on the CCW prior to the submission of the application.If necessary, the costing of research can be revised to reflect the value of the funding Agreement. Any adjustments must be made in negotiation with the Lead Principal Investigator and relevant HoD and the R&E Office.\n3. Consenting\nAs well as costing information, the CCW requires ethical and regulatory consents. The Lead Principal Investigator is responsible for obtaining these approvals.Once completed by the applicant, the CCW must be checked by the R&E Office and any changes negotiated with the applicant.If the CCW shows a difference between the calculated full cost of the research and the sum requested (price), authorisation is required from the HoD(s) and/or the relevant Dean(s) or PVC(s) (according to divisional delegation policies) to support the recommended waiver, and from the DVC R&E or their delegated authority to approve the waiver. This applies in all cases, including acceptance of funding from pre-approved organisations exempt from full cost recovery. If the shortfall is not a result of the organisation being one of the pre-approved organisations, a justification will be required.The final CCW must be signed or electronically approved by the applicant, the relevant departmental/divisional authority, the relevant Business Development Manager or Research Advisor, and the DVC R&E or delegated authority prior to submission of the application.\n4. Approval Delegations\nFor externally funded research, approval is required at both the costing and contracting stages. The two stages of approval are subject to different schedules of delegation, with costing delegations observing an established, devolved R&E practice, and contracting delegations abiding by the University's Financial Delegations Procedure and Schedule of Financial Delegations.At the costing stage, approval occurs via signing or electronic approval of the CCW by the DVC R&E or their delegated authority on the recommendation of the relevant PVC or their delegated authority. (Within R&E, costing approval is delegated from the DVC R&E to the Director R&E, and from the Director R&E to the appropriate R&E Office staff member \u2013 who is normally the Business Development Manager or Research Advisor working with a Lead Principal Investigator on an Agreement under development.)At the contracting stage, approval occurs when an Agreement is signed on behalf of the University by the DVC R&E or their delegated authority, who is normally the Director R&E. This follows the stipulations of the University's Financial Delegations Procedures and Schedule of Financial Delegations.\n5. Contracting\nA funder will normally forward an Agreement to the University when a decision has been made to purchase research or provide funding for non-exchange research. A standard University of Otago contract [Agreement] form is available from the R&E Office, though a funder will usually prefer to use its own form.A standard form, which is available from the R&E Office, must be used when the University is the contractor (i.e. when the University engages a subcontractor to deliver on a research project (e.g. MBIE contracts)).Agreements should contain: Full contact details for all parties to the Agreement;Statements on the ownership of intellectual property and publication rights;A statement relating to thesis submission (especially if a student is involved);A statement of confidentiality;A statement of governing law;A statement allowing either party to withdraw from the Agreement under appropriate circumstances;A statement on liability and, if applicable, indemnity;The date for the submission of the final report.Instructions as to the reporting procedure to the funding body during the course of the Agreement;The name(s) of the Lead Principal Investigator(s) or director of the project as well as the name(s), if available, of others engaged in the research and the department to which each belongs;Details of the budget (including whether the funding is to be exclusive or inclusive of GST);Method of payment and payment schedule (including invoice dates, if appropriate, and any requirements for payment (e.g. submission of report(s), a Purchase Order number, and so on));A term (meaning a start date and end date for the Agreement).The final Agreement is signed by a representative of the funder and the DVC R&E or their delegated authority on behalf of the University.Due to the dynamic and changeable nature of research, alterations to the protocols, procedures, timelines, milestones, objectives, etc. contained in the original Agreement may sometimes be necessary. Some changes may require the University to notify the funder by letter and to enter into a revision of the Agreement. Any renegotiation of Agreements must be handled by the R&E Office.\n6. Reporting\nReporting requirements vary between funders, and researchers should familiarise themselves with the particular requirements of their Agreement. Reporting guidelines and/or templates are normally available directly from funders, and a selection of guidelines and templates is also available from the R&E Office.All reports required by the funder must be prepared by the Lead Principal Investigator in consultation with the appropriate R&E staff member and submitted to the R&E Office two weeks ahead of the due date stated in the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed.The R&E Office will submit the report to the funder by the due date stated in the Agreement, unless agreed otherwise with the funding body and Lead Principal Investigator.\n7. Closing a Project\nAn externally funded research project has not concluded until the University has fulfilled all of its obligations to the funder, including any final reports, as defined in the Agreement.The research project must be closed in accordance with the University of Otago Research Project Closing Procedure.A Project Closure Form must be completed by the Lead Principal Investigator and returned to R&E for processing.Project Closure Form (PDF)The Lead Principal Investigator should outline on the Project Closure Form the preferred destination of any unspent funds, and identify the relevant University account if they are to be retained.The destination of unspent funds is usually determined by the Agreement. In many cases an underspend needs to be returned to the funder. If the Agreement is silent on the destination of funds, the matter will need to be negotiated between R&E (acting on behalf of the University) and the funder.Any over-spends will need to be covered by the University and are the responsibility of the Cost Centre associated with the research project.",

        "content": "1. Processing creditor invoices/credit notes\nCreditor invoices must be sent to the Accounts Payable Office directly from the creditor for entering into Finance One. To reduce risk and minimise delay, all invoices and credit notes should be emailed, ideally in PDF format, to: Email accounts@otago.ac.nzAfter receiving the invoice, an Accounts Payable Officer will check the invoice received is a valid tax invoice and contains a valid University of Otago purchase order number.If the invoice does not contain a purchase order number, the invoice will be rejected back to the supplier unpaid to request a purchase order number.If the invoice was received via email Accounts Payable will email the invoice to Kofax (data capturing scanning system) to be validated.If the invoice was sent via post Accounts Payable will sort the invoices into appropriate batches and manually scan these into Kofax.Once the invoices appear in Kofax the Accounts Payable team will validate the invoice by checking each field is pulling through into the correct area. For example, the total amount to pay equals the total amount on the invoice including GST .After validating the invoices, the invoices will either appear: In the data warehouse. When an invoice goes into the data warehouse an automated email is sent to the individual who created the purchase order advising them to receipt the purchase order (a copy of the invoice is also attached to the automated message). It is then up to the individual to ensure that purchase order is receipt as soon as possible. If the purchase order is still not receipt after 8 days, the document will come into the Accounts Payable workflow pool and Accounts Payable will send this to the department's workflow pool to action; orIn Finance One workflow (could be either the department's workflow pool if a manual purchase order has been provided or Accounts Payable depending on what action is required).Invoices that have no been automatically matched will need a final visual check that all information has been correctly transferred from the invoice to the digital record before posting.\n2.Overseas creditor invoices\nOverseas creditors are paid twice monthly in the appropriate currency.Cost Centres will be charged in NZ dollars using the spot foreign exchange ( FX ) rates on the date of the invoice\n3. Querying an invoice\nIf an invoice should not be paid, the Accounts Payable Office must be notified immediately, and any correspondence relating to this must be forwarded to: Email accounts@otago.ac.nz This enables Accounts Payable officers to directly deal with any queries received from the supplier.\n4. Creditor payment method\nThe preferred option for paying creditors is by direct credit. This system allows the University to pay creditors by Electronic Funds Transfer ( EFT ).\n5. Creditor payment dates\nA schedule of deadlines to return creditor invoices to the Accounts Payable Office and payment dates is maintained by Operational Finance, Shared Services. Schedule of Creditor Deadlines\n6. Invoices v statements\nPayments to creditors will be made on receipt of approved invoices (not statements) addressed to the University of Otago. An approved invoice includes a legitimate purchase order number.A statement is a summary of outstanding invoices and credits that are due for payment.Statements are not treated in the same way as invoices and do not appear in Finance One. When the Accounts Payable Office receives a statement, a manual reconciliation is performed to ensure that all invoices and credits are processed. If there are any invoices or credits that have not been received, the Accounts Payable team will email the creditor to request copies.\n7.

        "name": "Student_Academic_Misconduct_Procedures",
        "scope": "These procedures apply to all staff and students of the University. Note that academic misconduct in these procedures refers to breaches of academic integrity by students. There are separate policies and procedures relating to academic misconduct by staff.",
        "content": "1. General Principles\nThe University shall investigate alleged instances of academic misconduct in a manner which is fair, consistent and transparent.The University defines three levels of academic misconduct: Level One: A first instance of academic misconduct where a student's actions may be regarded as unintentional or na\u00efve and contributed to by a lack of understanding of acceptable academic practice.Level Two: Academic misconduct where a student's actions are perceived to be intentional and where the student could reasonably be expected to understand academic practice, or any repeat instance of academic misconduct.Level Three: Academic misconduct in which actions are perceived as being intentional and of an extremely serious nature including instances of falsification or fabrication of data, impersonation and/or purchasing of assessment, and instances of persistent academic misconduct.Notwithstanding the definitions provided in clause 1(b), any academic misconduct which occurs in a final examination or thesis or dissertation and from which a student gains a demonstrable academic advantage, shall normally be considered Level Two or Level Three misconduct.Student actions which represent genuine but flawed attempts to demonstrate academic integrity will not normally be considered academic misconduct, but will instead be addressed through marking and feedback as part of standard assessment processes.Consistent with the University's Academic Integrity Policy, Level One misconduct will be primarily treated in an educative manner. Level Two and Three misconduct will result in disciplinary sanctions.\n2. Types of Academic Misconduct\nPlagiarism: copying or cutting and pasting text from others without using quotation marks or block quotes to identify that text, nor clearly indicating the source (this includes paper and electronic sources)copying visual materials, images and/or physical objects without clearly indicating the sourceusing poor paraphrasing of sentences or whole passages without referencing the original workusing another person's ideas, work or research data without acknowledgmentcopying computer files or computer code without clearly indicating their originsubmitting another student's work in whole or in part, where this is not specifically permitted in the course outlinesubmitting work that has been written by someone else on a student's behalfresubmitting portions of previously submitted work without indicating the source.Unauthorised collaboration: presenting group work in any form of assessment where individual answers are required. This does not include assessment tasks where students are expressly required or permitted to present the results of collaborative work. Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, each student's answers should be in their own words.Multiple submissions of single assessment: submitting substantially the same work for multiple assessments; presenting work submitted previously at the University or another educational institution.Impersonation: getting someone else to participate in any assessment on one's behalf, including getting someone else to sit a test or examination on one's behalf.Use of unauthorised materials: using notes, books or other material in the completion of assessment unless expressly permitted to do so; taking calculators, computers or other electronic devices (e.g. cell phones or tablets) into a test or examination unless expressly permitted to do so.Assisting others in academic misconduct: impersonating another student in a test or examinationwriting an assignment for another studentgiving answers to another student in a test, examination or any other assessment (whether in a current or previously offered paper) by any direct or indirect meansallowing another student to copy answers in a test, examination or any other assessment.Misrepresentation: feigning disability, temporary illness or injury or exceptional circumstances beyond one's control, and then claiming special conditions and/or special consideration.Purchasing assessment: submitting for assessment material obtained from commercial essays, assignment services, other students or any other source.Falsification: falsifying or fabricating the results of one's research or laboratory assignments; presenting as true or accurate material that one knows to be false or inaccurate.Breach of ethics: a breach of a duty of confidentiality, privacy or the terms of any ethical approvals.Breach of intellectual property: using the intellectual property of others in an unauthorised manner, including copyright breach and the unauthorised sharing of the work of others.Other misconduct: actions that are deemed to contravene the values and accepted practices associated with academic integrity.\n3. Authority for Dealing with Academic Misconduct\nIn the first instance: all suspected instances of academic misconduct in in-person final examinations must be referred to the Head, Student Experienceall suspected instances of academic misconduct in online final examinations using the ExamSoft platform must be referred to the Head, Student Experienceall other suspected instances of academic misconduct, including online final examinations not using ExamSoft, must be referred to the relevant Head of Department (or nominee).Alleged instances of Level One academic misconduct, excluding those relating to doctoral degrees (see 3(d) below),\u00a0\u00a0which proceed to a full investigation shall normally be dealt with by the relevant Head of Department (or their nominee \u2013 referred to as the Head of Department henceforth).Alleged instances of Level Two and Level Three academic misconduct, excluding those relating to doctoral degrees (see 3(d) below), which proceed to a full investigation shall be dealt with by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division (or their nominee \u2013 referred to as the Pro-Vice-Chancellor henceforth) within which the relevant assessment was conducted.Alleged instances of academic misconduct in relation to doctoral degrees which proceed to a full investigation shall be dealt with by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) in consultation with the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor(s) or their nominee(s).Level Three academic misconduct and extremely serious academic misconduct in doctoral degrees shall be referred to and dealt with by the Vice-Chancellor, if the party that has determined misconduct occurred recommends that the student concerned be excluded from the University.In instances where the person who would usually have responsibility for dealing with the alleged misconduct may have a conflict of interest, for example if he or she is supervising a student whose research work is to be investigated, advice should be sought from the Head, Student Experience who will arrange for the matter to be dealt with by a different person with appropriate authority under the Academic Statute.Any delegation of authority relating to the investigation of academic misconduct, including any standing delegation or delegation due to a conflict of interest, should be documented in writing prior to any investigation taking place.\n4.Procedural Fairness\nA student shall be presumed innocent unless and until guilt is freely admitted or is determined with appropriate certainty.The University will ensure that: the student will be informed in writing of the subject matter of the complaint and the possible penalties if misconduct is found to have occurredthe student will have access to information about the allegation of misconductthe student will be given adequate notice of the process and timelines for dealing with the alleged misconductthe student will be offered the opportunity to be heard before a determination is made in relation to the alleged misconductthe process of inquiry and determination will be conducted without biasa determination will be made only on the basis of facts and documentation relevant to the alleged misconduct (this will include the referencing of the Academic Misconduct Register to ascertain whether the student has been involved in previous cases of academic misconduct)the student will be notified in writing of the outcome including reasons to explain the outcomethe student will be notified of their right of appeal in accordance with clause 5.11 of the Academic Statute 2011.\n5.Identification of Potential Misconduct\nWhere a staff member identifies activity that they believe may constitute academic misconduct, they should first determine whether this meets the threshold for formal investigation under these procedures (see clause 1(d)).Where the potential misconduct considered falls within the definition of plagiarism, the staff member should take into account: whether the student has attempted to acknowledge the work of othersthe extent of the potential plagiarismthe previous opportunities the student may have had to learn correct academic practice, andwhether the matter can be adequately addressed through marking and feedback as part of standard assessment processes.In determining whether a formal investigation is needed, staff may contact Student Administration to check the Academic Misconduct Register to determine whether the student has any previous academic misconduct which has been formally addressed through these procedures.Staff members requiring additional advice on whether identified activity meets the threshold for formal investigation should consult with the Associate Dean (Academic) in their Division.\n6. Preliminary Investigation\nA preliminary investigation shall be carried out where an activity which meets the threshold for possible academic misconduct is identified. This should usually occur within seven days of detection of the alleged offence and should determine either that: there is sufficient evidence that the matter should proceed to a full investigation, orthere is insufficient evidence to proceed, orthere is no case and the matter should proceed no further. Final ExaminationsIn relation to final examinations the preliminary investigation shall be the responsibility of the Head, Student Experience, except where 3(a)iii applies, and the steps at 6(c)i-vi shall be followedFollowing the identification of a possible academic misconduct in a final examination, normally by an examination supervisor, the Group Leader, Examinations shall: obtain whatever evidence may be possible in the circumstances, including a written statement from the examination supervisorinterview the student(s), if practicable, immediately following their departure from the examination room and invite the student to make a written statementinform the student in writing of the nature of allegation and the process for the preliminary investigationforward a copy of the script to the department so that this may be marked while any investigation is taking place, the result to be impounded pending completion of the investigationask the Student Records Office to add 'Result deferred' immediately to the student's record until a decision has been reached and, if applicable, a mark awardedpass all information relating to the instance to the Head, Student Experience.The Head, Student Experience or relevant Head of Department (or nominee) as applicable shall either: determine that a full investigation is to take place as per clause 7 below and refer the matter to the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or their nominee), providing a completed Alleged Academic Misconduct Initial Report, ordetermine that a full investigation is not warranted, inform the student of this and update their record accordingly.The Head, Student Experience, or relevant Head of Department (or nominee) for online final examinations not using ExamSoft, may exercise option 6(d)ii in any case in which the University's Examination Rules were breached, but where it is clear that a student's actions were na\u00efve and no academic advantage was gained. In such cases the student shall be issued with a warning and the misconduct shall be recorded in the Academic Misconduct Register with a note that it was dealt with under this provision.All Other CasesIn cases other than final Examinations the preliminary investigation shall be the responsibility of the relevant Head of Department or an appropriate nominee.In relation to department-run tests or examinations, the process outlined in 6(c)i-iv should be used as appropriate, with the Head of Department (or appropriate nominee) undertaking the role of the Group Leader, Examinations. In such cases the student should be informed if it is determined that a full investigation is not warranted.If it is concluded that a full investigation is warranted the Head of Department shall contact the Head, Student Experience (at academic.integrity@otago.ac.nz) who will, within two working days, provide details from the Academic Misconduct Register on whether the student has previously been involved in academic misconduct at the University.As regards the full investigation: if the alleged misconduct to be investigated relates to doctoral degrees, the Head of Department shall refer the matter to the Dean of the Graduate Research School, providing a completed Alleged Academic Misconduct Initial Report, for further investigation by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise), otherwise:if the student has previous offending recorded on the Academic Misconduct Register and/or there is significant reason to believe the alleged misconduct is deliberate, the Head of Department shall refer the matter to the Head, Student Experience, providing a completed Alleged Academic Misconduct Initial Report, for further investigation by the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or their nominee), orif there is reason to believe the alleged misconduct is unintentional or na\u00efve, and the student has no previous record of offending on the Academic Misconduct Register, the Head of Department shall conduct a full investigation as per clause 7 below.\n7. Procedure for a Full Investigation\nThe investigating party shall inform the student in writing of the subject matter of the complaint and possible penalties if academic misconduct should be found to have occurred, using the appropriate letter template available from academic.integrity@otago.ac.nz. A copy of this letter should also be sent to the Head, Student Experience.The full investigation shall consider any material from the preliminary investigation, any further evidence collected, and the student's response (see 7(c) below), and shall take account of the following factors: the extent of the misconductthe student's intentioncontextual factors including but not limited to: stage/level of programmenumber and severity of previous offensesother information relevant to the caseacademic conventions within the relevant disciplinethe extent to which the misconduct, if undetected, would have resulted in an unfair advantage for the student or any other studentthe extent to which the misconduct, if undetected, would have had potential to compromise the integrity of the University's assessment processesthe impact of particular outcomes on a student's progression or graduationinformation and support provided to the student about academic integrity as part of their courseinformation about the student held in the Academic Misconduct Register.The student must be given the opportunity to be heard, before a final decision is made. The student should be given both the option to respond in person (with a support person present if desired) and to provide a written response.Following their investigation, the investigating party may: find that no academic misconduct has occurreddetermine an outcome commensurate with their powers and the level of offending as per Clause 8 of these proceduresfor allegations which have been investigated by the Head of Department and for which there is evidence of offending above Level One, refer the matter to the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor for further considerationfor allegations which have been investigated by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor or a Pro-Vice-Chancellor and for which there is evidence of offending at Level Three, refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor if exclusion of the student from the University is recommended. In all instances, the final outcome or referral should be reported to the Head, Student Experience (at academic.integrity@otago.ac.nz).The investigating party must keep a detailed record of their investigation.Where possible, investigations should be completed within a two-week timeframe.\n 8. Schedule of Outcomes where Academic Misconduct is Proven\nThe University shall take a primarily educative response to Level One misconduct. The Head of Department or Pro-Vice-Chancellor, or their nominees, shall take one or more of the following actions, including at least one educative action from options i to iv: issue the student with a warning that includes information about the University's Academic Integrity Policy and resources that are available to support the policyrequire the student to enrol in an academic integrity workshop or study skills workshop, or undertake personal consultancy with a Learning Adviser in Student Learning Development, within one month of receiving the letter advising them to do sorequire the student to undertake a supplementary, formative reflective assessment on academic integrityrequire the student to submit a new or revised version of the assessment affected by the academic misconduct, with the mark awarded for the resubmitted assessment not to exceed the student's original mark (including any adjustments made under 8(a)v)reduce the mark in the affected assessment so that the student gains no academic advantage from the misconduct; any such mark reduction should: not normally exceed 50% of the total available marks for the assessmenttake account of any reduction in marks (related to the misconduct) imposed through standard marking processes, andnot penalise the student beyond removing any advantage gained from the misconduct.In response to Level Two misconduct, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor or their nominee shall include at least one educative response from 8(a)ii \u2013 iii above and one of the penalties provided for under the Academic Statute, such as: submission of a new or revised version of the assessment with a maximum of a \u201cpass\u201d for the assessmenta zero mark for the assessment affected by the academic misconducta reduction in the overall mark for the paper affected by the academic misconducta fail grade for the paper in which the academic misconduct occurred, which may include withholding or withdrawing the granting of terms for the paper concernedthe cancellation of any pass or passes for any other part of the student's course undertaken in the same teaching period as the paper in which academic misconduct occurred, provided that any pass shall only be cancelled with the agreement of the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division in which the paper is taughtthe imposition of a non-academic penalty, consisting of a fine of up to $500 or community work of up 40 hours, provided that such a penalty will only be imposed where the student concerned could not have derived direct academic advantage from their misconduct.In response to misconduct in a doctoral degree, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) may include educational responses from 8(a) above and/or impose one of the penalties provided for under the Academic statute, such as: resubmission of the work affected by the complaint, either fully or in partdisqualification from continuing in the degree.In response to Level Three misconduct, including extremely serious misconduct in a doctoral degree, any appropriate penalties or responses provided for under the Academic Statute, including those listed under clauses 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c), may be imposed by the relevant authority or by the Vice-Chancellor. In addition, the Vice-Chancellor may direct that the student be excluded from the University permanently or for such period as the Vice-Chancellor may determine.The Head of the relevant Department shall be responsible for ensuring that any educational requirements as detailed under 8(a) are completed. Failure to satisfactorily complete such requirements shall be reported to the Head, Student Experience. This may entail: 'Result deferred' being reported for the relevant paper on the student's academic record and the paper being deemed incomplete until requirements have been met, orthe substitution of a penalty under clause 8(b) by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor or their nominee, if a student fails to complete a requirement within a reasonable timeframe and after at least two written warnings have been given. This may include a non-academic penalty as provided for under 8(b)vi.To ensure consistency in the application of the non-academic penalties provided for under clause 8(b)vi, the Pro-Vice-Chancellors shall maintain and apply a shared schedule of recommended outcomes for types of misconduct which may necessitate such penalties.The Proctor shall be responsible for ensuring that the requirements of any non-academic penalties imposed under clause 8(b)vi are met. Failure to meet such requirements shall be considered a breach of the Code of Student Conduct.\n9. Notification of Outcome\nUpon conclusion of the investigation, the investigating party shall advise the Head, Student Experience of the outcome.In cases of alleged misconduct in a doctoral degree, the Dean of the Graduate Research School will inform the candidate in writing of the outcome. The Head of Department, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) and, where relevant, Vice-Chancellor, will receive a copy of this letter.In all other cases, the Head, Student Experience will inform the student in writing of the outcome. The Head of Department, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and, where relevant, Proctor and/or Vice-Chancellor, will receive a copy of this letter. This communication will normally be sent within two working days of receiving notification of an outcome.Where an educational task or a penalty is imposed, notification of the student's right to request a review or appeal the decision, and the mechanism for a review or an appeal, shall be included in the letter to the student reporting the outcome of the investigation.\n10. Right of Appeal\nA student may appeal an academic misconduct decision made by: a Head of Department, to the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor, whose decision on the matter shall be finalthe Vice-Chancellor or Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) , or a Pro-Vice-Chancellor, to the Appeals Board of the University Council, in accordance with the provisions of the Appeals Statute.\n11. Reporting\nThe Head, Student Experience will provide oversight in relation to the completion of educative requirements as outlined under clauses 8(a) and 8(e).The Head, Student Experience shall ensure an accurate and up-to-date Academic Misconduct Register is maintained and that this information is kept confidential and accessed solely for investigating academic misconduct and providing reports on academic misconduct.The Head, Student Experience shall: ensure that all cases for the previous year are reviewed in January to check for trends, developments and repeat casesprovide a six-monthly update on academic misconduct to Pro-Vice-Chancellorsprovide an annual report on academic misconduct to Pro-Vice-Chancellors.The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) and Pro-Vice-Chancellors shall make reports to Senate and Council following the end of each academic year, containing a summary of all doctoral misconduct and Level Two and Three misconduct dealt with by them during that year. Such reports shall not include the names of individuals and shall as far as possible avoid reference to circumstances which might render any individual identifiable.AcknowledgementThese procedures are based on best practice principles developed by the Australian Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT)-commissioned Exemplary Academic Integrity Project (EAIP).

The level of income derived is very dependent on interest rates and the cash flow patterns in the University.\nThe management of departmental cash flow can have a significant influence on this income by ensuring:\n\nany sales are for cash, not credit\nany invoices issued are processed promptly and paid on time\nbanking of cash is performed regularly\n\n\n Trust income\nThe University is the beneficiary of many donations each year. Many of these donations are held by the University in Trust. Further information is available in the Trust Funds Procedures.\n\n\nDepartmental banking\nIntroduction\nCash and cheques are received by University Departments as part of the day-to-day management of the department. The receipts may result from cash sales or the payment of invoices issued previously by departments. This section describes the procedures for collecting (receipting) and banking (departmental banking) cash and cheques. \nThe Revenue Management Office is responsible for the administration and supervision of all University banking. The Revenue Management Office is situated in the basement of the Clocktower Building, Dunedin.\nThere are also Cashiers located at the Otago Dental and Medical Schools and the Christchurch and Wellington Schools of Medicine.\nSecurity of cash on departmental premises\nNo department can hold more than $500 of cash and cheques. One member of staff should be responsible and ensure that all monies are kept in a safe or lockable cash box secured in a locked cupboard or drawer with secure overnight storage. Cash should be counted out of public view.\nCash should not be sent through the internal mail to the Revenue Management Office for banking \u2013 any cash should be delivered in person.\nWhere departments hold petty cash for cash requirements please contact the Accounts Payable Manager, Accounts Department.\nWhere significant amounts of cash are likely to be collected, appropriate security should be arranged to ensure the safety of staff. Contact the Revenue Management Office for further information regarding security.\nFrequency of departmental banking\nBanking should be done weekly unless receipts exceed $500, in which case banking must be done on the day. Special arrangements to exceed the weekly criteria can be made with the Cashier, however these will not supersede the $500 requirement.\nDepartments with EFTPOS facilities should liaise with the Cashiers Section in respect of banking times and frequency.\nStandard banking procedure\nThere are two methods of departmental banking:\n\nthrough Cashiers Section, Registry\ndirect lodgement to University's bank account\n\n Both methods require the use of a sub receipt book and a banking summary form described in the next sections and available from the  Revenue Management Office.\n\n\nFor banking through the Cashiers Section     Deliver banking to the Revenue Management Office in the Clock Tower Building who will check the cash and cheques and the validity of the general ledger codes and invoice numbers, then a Cashiers receipt will be issued while the person depositing the banking is present.\n\nFor direct lodgements to the University's bank account     Deliver the banking to a branch of the National Bank of New Zealand for deposit to the University's bank account. Deposit slips for this purpose can be arranged by the Revenue Management Office.\n\nOnce the deposit has taken place, promptly fax or email the Revenue Management Office a copy of the banking summary form to identify the deposited credit to the University's bank account.\nThe Revenue Management Office will receipt this deposit to the supplied ledger codes and invoice numbers as per the banking summary.\nThe receipt number can be located from the ledger code in Finance One for your reference for the deposit.\nIssue of Sub Receipts\nThe Revenue Management Office issues receipts for all departmental banking. Departments issue Sub Receipts for any funds they receive.\nSub Receipts must be issued and signed for all funds received. The only exception is student tuition fees which will be processed by the Revenue Management Office, Registry and Christchurch and Wellington Schools of Medicine and the University's Auckland Office. WSM, CSM and the Auckland Office should itemise the student numbers, names and year to which the fee payments relate on the banking summary form.\nThe supporting documentation for each Sub Receipt should be held in the department (with the exception of student tuition fees).\nLodgements should not include Sub Receipts from more than one Sub Receipt book.\nSub Receipts Register form\nA Sub Receipt Register form is on the cover of each Sub Receipt book. This should be maintained by the Department for audit purposes.\nThe register form should be completed for every banking by entering:\n\nThe sub receipt numbers from the banking summary form\nTotal dollars receipted\nThe date\nSignature of person completing the banking\nEnter the receipt number and date of the receipt once the Cashiers have receipted the banking. The receipt number can be found under the general ledger code in Finance One.\n\nOnce the sub receipt book is completed, this is held by the Department.\nAny cancelled sub receipts should be noted on the front form and both copies left in the sub receipt book (marked cancelled).\nNote: Where a cash register is used that provide till tapes and totals at the end of each day, the use of a sub receipt is not required. However, these till tapes must be held in the Department as documentation agreeing to the banking summary. Attach these tapes to the relevant banking summary form copy which is held by the Department for audit purposes. Do not send till tapes to the Revenue Management Office.\nCash and cheques\nOn receipt\nAll cheques must be made payable to University of Otago, not the department or any other name. The University of Otago is the only payee for all inwards remittances as per the Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 1995. It is recommended that departments obtain a stamp to cross cheques made out in person \u2013 \u201cUniversity of Otago \u2013 Not Transferable\u201d.\nOverseas drafts or cheques must NOT be stamped on the front and should be entered on a separate banking summary form. Overseas cheques in foreign currency will be converted to New Zealand currency by the Revenue Management Office at the current day's exchange rates and the converted amount will be credited to the nominated debtor or ledger account. The Cashiers receipt will show the New Zealand amount banked.\nNote: overseas drafts/cheques must meet certain criteria in order to be banked. If the criteria are not met, items cost a minimum of $50 to be sent overseas \u201con collection\u201d. In this case the Revenue Management Office will advise the department concerned so payment can be arranged by an alternative method. Contact the Revenue Management Office for further information.\nThe number of the sub-receipt issued should be written on the reverse of the cheque. When paying in person, the payee should also put their name, local address and telephone number on the back of the cheque. This saves time in pursuing dishonoured cheques should this occur.\nSurpluses/deficits \u2013 ideally there should be none but if these occur they are to be advised in the first instance to the cashier who will advise procedures. Should there be a recurrence the internal auditor is to be advised.\nFor banking\nDollar notes: Banknotes are counted by weighing, so to save time for bank staff when weighing them, please don't fold the notes nor hold them together with bands, paper clips etc. Simply flatten them and put all notes together in order of denomination and put one rubber band around the whole lot. A full bundle is $20s \u2013 $2,000.00; $10s \u2013 $1,000.00; $5s \u2013 $500.00 (NB: If you have enough for a \u201cfull bundle\u201d as above, this should be separated within its own rubber band, otherwise all notes should be banded into one pile).\nCoins: Coin is also counted by weighing, therefore if you have a full bag in any one denomination, please ensure it holds only $100 gold (or $10 silver). If you have lesser amounts than $100 (or $10), please bag each denomination separately i.e. do not mix the various coins, as wrong denominations in wrong bags will create problems when weighing the coin. If the coin is less than $20.00 it can all go in one bag. Further to this, please do not make up bags to $100 (or $10) with different denominations.\nRounding policy\nFrom 1 August 2006 the following rounding will apply to cash transactions:\n\nWhere the total price ends in 5 cents or less \u2013 round down to the nearest 10c.\nWhere the total price ends in 6 cents or more \u2013 round up to the nearest 10c.\n\nDishonoured cheques\nIf a cheque is dishonoured by the bank as \u201cRefer to Drawer/Account Closed or Payment Stopped,\u201d the Cashier's receipt will be reversed by journal and a copy of this and the cheque sent to the department to obtain repayment \u2013 it is recommended this be in cash or a bank cheque. A sub receipt should be issued for the repayment and the cheque included on the banking summary crediting the appropriate general ledger code.\nIn general\nPersonal cheques are not to be cashed, or have change given.\nPreparation of banking summary forms\nA banking summary form must be used for every banking whether through the Revenue Management Office or a direct lodgement to the bank. The forms are available in Excel format by using one of the templates listed below. The spreadsheet format will ensure that additions and extensions are correct and will automatically calculate GST and the banking totals.\nThere are four banking summary forms for use:\n\nGeneral Ledger Only\nGeneral Ledger and Debtors Only\nCredit Card Only\nEftpos Only\n\nThese forms are available at the Financial Services Forms Store.\nThere are two methods for completing the banking summary form:\n1. Entering into Excel spreadsheet on computer:\nAdd all sub receipts issued since the last banking, entering the total sum in the sub receipt-book.\nKey the sub receipt numbers covering the lodgement in the space provided on the banking summary form along with department name, date of lodgement, contact name and telephone number.\nAnalyse and enter particulars and individual general ledger codes or invoice numbers into the spreadsheet in the appropriate fields, entering the total sums for each code in the Total column \u2013 the GST and Sub Totals will automatically calculate. If the Total figure is GST exempt enter a 'Z' into the appropriate \"Z=No GST\" field \u2013 the GST amount will change to \u201cN/A\u201d (not applicable) and the Sub Total figure will amend accordingly.\nEnsure the automatically calculated Grand Total sum at the bottom of the spreadsheet agrees with the previously recorded total in the sub receipt-book.\nEnter cash, cheque, EFTPOS or credit card details into the appropriate fields at the top right hand corner of the banking summary spreadsheet.\nThe Total Banking figure must agree with the Grand Total of banking summary. If it doesn't match, the narration \u201cDOESN'T BALANCE!\u201d will automatically display, only disappearing when the two figures are matched.\nPrint the spreadsheet and sign the banking summary.\nCredit card, EFTPOS or overseas funds should be entered on separate banking summary forms.\n\n 2. Handwritten on banking summary form:\nAdd all sub receipts issued since the last banking, entering the total sum both in the sub receipt-book and in the Grand Total section of the departmental banking summary sheet.\nWrite the sub receipt numbers covering the lodgement in the space provided on the banking summary form along with department name, date of lodgement, contact name, signature and telephone number.\nAnalyse and enter individual general ledger codes or invoice numbers and amounts to be credited in the appropriate fields. Ensure this breakdown correctly adds to the Grand Totals.\nCalculate GST on sums being credited to General Ledger account codes and extend to the Total column.\nWhen payment is received for an invoice, the invoice number MUST be entered. GST is not deducted from invoices.\nEnter cash, cheque, EFTPOS or credit card details on the banking summary. The Total Banking figure must agree with the Grand Total of banking summary.\nCredit card or overseas funds should be entered on separate banking summary forms.\n\n\nTreatment of GST on receipts\n\n Donations and \u201cUnconditional Gifts exempt from GST\u201d\nExtra care must be taken with \u201cdonations\u201d. If the donation is made as a result of the provision of goods or services then IRD do not consider this a donation and the payment must have GST deducted. The donation must be given without conditions and this exemption will apply only in rare instances.\nIf a remittance is received from a non-profit body and is believed to represent an \u201cunconditional gift\u201d the cheque must be forwarded to the Registry Revenue Management Office, together with full supporting documentation. The Revenue Management Office will ensure that the GST treatment is correct based on the information supplied. If there is any doubt, the University will set out in a letter its understanding for the receipt to clarify the most appropriate GST treatment. It is likely that GST will be deducted from the receipt as the IRD impose severe penalties where tax is not returned according to the law. Hence we take a conservative approach in evaluating these situations.\nAn unconditional gift has a special meaning for GST purposes. Generally it is a payment made to the University where the donor receives no \u201cidentifiable direct value benefit\u201d as a result. However, if a donor is provided with a GST tax invoice in respect of a sum received the parties are acknowledging that there has been a supply of goods and services.\nA donor may be assumed to have made an unconditional gift even though a condition, specifying the purpose for which it may be used, is attached to the gift. This is provided the gift is voluntary, for the purposes of the University, and the donor received no \u201cidentifiable direct value benefit\u201d.  It is only in circumstances where the entity paying the university is not registered for GST where this will make any difference. This is because the GST component of any payment made by a registered person will be recovered from the IRD.\nIf your department receives money which may fit into this category, but you are unsure, please contact the Revenue Management Office in the first instance \u2013 they have access to specialist advice.\nAgency accounts\nSome departments perform receipting functions on behalf of parties external to the University (the principal). For example Recreation Services collect subs for some sports clubs. The receipts from these activities are kept in an agency account. This money is not owned by the University and normally no GST is to be deducted as the principal is responsible for returning the GST, if you believe you are carrying out an agency function but are unsure, contact the Revenue Management Office for advice.\nPayments from overseas\nEach payment will be treated on a one to one individual basis and the cheque should be forwarded to the Registry Revenue Management Office, together with full documentation. The staff will ensure that the GST treatment is correct based on the information supplied.\n\n\nEFTPOS\nElectronic Funds Transfer \u2013 Point of Sale units have been installed in some departments where significant amounts of receipts are collected. Benefits will arise from reduced labour for cash handling, better security as less cash is on hand, guaranteed payment for valid transactions (no dishonoured cheques), quicker to process than cheques, and increased customer satisfaction on payment options. The only fees associated with an EFTPOS machine is the rental cost and ETSL charge.\nPoints to note regarding University EFTPOS transactions are:\nWhile EFTPOS terminals can accept both debit and credit cards each terminal needs to be set up to handle credit card transactions, if your terminal does not accept credit cards, please contact the Revenue Management Office.\nCash is not to be issued from the EFTPOS sites. EFTPOS is to be offered as a method of payment only.\nA daily &lquo;financial settlement time\u201d needs to be chosen for each day's transactions, the $ total at this settlement time being credited to the University's bank account daily. This will normally be a time that suits each type of operation i.e. a Hall, a department, a business activity. The EFTPOS terminal is settled at the nominated time so to obtain totals which are entered on the EFTPOS banking summary which is to be faxed to the Revenue Management Office each working day.\nBecause an EFTPOS receipt is produced for the customer with each transaction it will not be necessary to issue individual sub receipts, but when the terminal is \u201csettled\u201d daily a sub receipt should be written for the bulk total of the EFTPOS transactions.\nThe Revenue Management Office will coordinate installation and necessary procedures associated with EFTPOS and can advise the associated costs.\n\n\nCredit card receipts\n Visa and Mastercard will be accepted by the University for all payments except for the following:\n\nAll student fees\nStudent accommodation payments\nPayments for amounts on debtor statements\n\n Credit cards other than Visa and Mastercard will not be accepted.\nAll credit card payments incur a merchant service charge. This will be charged to the department accepting the payment. The current charge is 1.55 per cent of the value of the transaction. This is subject to change.\nDepartmental applications for accepting payment by credit card should be forwarded to the Revenue Accountant for consideration.\nProcedure:\nIssue a sub-receipt for credit card payments.\nA separate banking summary form must be used for credit card transactions.\nA ledger expenditure code must be provided on the banking summary in order to debit the merchant service charge.\nThe detail required to process a mail order transaction includes:\n\nCardholder's name\nExpiry date of credit card\nCardholder's number\n$NZD amount\nSignature\nCard Security Code (three digit number on the reverse side of the credit card)\n\nPayment details are to be attached to the banking summary form.\nThe Revenue Management Office will advise if any transactions are declined, departments are advised to delay the dispatch of purchased goods until the receipt for credit card banking is received in the department.\nSecurity of credit card information\nCredit card transactions sent to Financial Services Cashiers Office for processing:\nThe processing of all transactions where the card is not present will be done by the Revenue Management Office. Departments MUST ensure that any credit card detail and information sent to the Revenue Management Office is not copied, replicated or stored electronically in any fashion.\nThe Revenue Management Office will ensure all information is held in a secure place with restricted access.\nFor information on University Purchase Cards refer to the Purchase Card Policy and Procedure.\n\n\nCredit card gateway\n\n University procedures\nAll departments wishing to use this website must submit an ecommerce application form to the Revenue Management Office, Financial Services Division for each activity they wish to set up to connect to this secure site.\nThe Revenue Management Office will then determine if the ecommerce site is the most efficient way to receive the transactions. Once this is approved, the proposed web site will be checked by the ITS security officer and an access code for the site allocated. This access code identifies all payments to that particular department and allocates a general ledger code for receipting of the funds.\nDepartments will construct their own web page for each activity, e.g. an upcoming conference. On this page customers should be able to select various options, e.g. conference registration only or conference registration plus accommodation. Once the customer has selected their requirements, they will click on a link to enable them to make the payment by credit card. This link will direct the customer to the University's secure payment page where the credit card details are entered and the transaction sent to the bank.\nWhen this has been completed the cardholder will be re-routed back to the department's web page where they will be presented with a status page, including a tax invoice / receipt if the transaction is successful. The receipt / invoice shall comply with bank guidelines as set out in the following example: Credit Card Gateway Sample Invoice/Receipt Form\nAccess to reports which will give a summary of card payments will be made available to departments.\nA total settlement figure of all payments processed each day through the payment page will settle to the University's bank account. An automated receipt batch will be created daily crediting the general ledger codes set out on the ecommerce application form for that particular web page. This batch will also debit Departments with admin and bank fees applying to each transaction.\nCredit card numbers will not be held in departments for security reasons.\nAny refund requests will be passed to the Revenue Management Office to action. Refunds will be processed to the same credit card as the initial transaction.\nThe process\n\n\nFill out the application form and return to Revenue Management Office.\nThe Revenue Management Office will email you an activity key which is for you to develop and test your website.\nWhen ready to go live contact the cashiers who will then set up a live activity and provide you with the new LIVE activity.\nAll that is required to change your test site to LIVE site collecting data is to replace the test activity key with the live activity key and change your URL to point to the live credit card gateway, by removing \u201c_test\u201d from the original URL you were provided for testing purposes.\n\nRevenue Management Office do have the contact details for a PHP designer should you need to contract one, otherwise contact ITS who may be able to provide you with contact details of an ITS consultant that can help you.\nAn information pack containing sample code for interfacing with the credit card gateway, documentation and sample invoices is available from: http://ecommerce.otago.ac.nz/\nFor gateway issues contact the Revenue Management Office.\nAs you are collecting personal information, you need to take steps to secure the information in accordance with the privacy act.\nThe Revenue Management Office may request information from you regarding a transaction.\nIf a cardholder should ever dispute a transaction, the University's bank will require us to pass all relevant information to them in the dispute process.\nAt a minimum please make sure you collect and retain the following:\n\nName of person completing form\nContact details for the above including phone number and address if possible\n\n",

This outcome shall be recorded, and all information put forward in the process shall be managed in a manner that appropriately protects the interests of those involved.If, in light of the report of the Preliminary Inquiry, the DVC R&E considers that a Formal Investigation may be warranted, the researcher shall be advised accordingly and shall be given a copy of the report and provided seven (7) days to supply further written comment.After considering any further comment under clause 4(b) the DVC R&E shall either: determine that the matter be closed, in which case clause 4(a) shall apply, orproceed to establish a Formal Investigation under clause 5.The DVC R&E may also: determine whether there are other individuals or organisations that need to be informed of the circumstancesif concerned that the complainant has acted in bad faith, refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor for consideration to be given to action to be taken against that personrefer any other forms of misconduct that it appears may have occurred for action under the Ethical Behaviour Policy or other applicable policies.\n5. Formal Investigation\nThe DVC R&E shall establish an Investigation Panel of one or more persons to conduct the Formal Investigation in accordance with these procedures and under specific Terms of Reference appropriate to the relevant situation.The DVC R&E shall ensure the Investigation Panel is free from any actual or apparent bias and may make appointments to the Investigation Panel from within or from outside the University.As far as possible, Formal Investigations shall be undertaken on a confidential basis.If a researcher under investigation leaves the University before a Formal Investigation is complete it will nevertheless be completed in the interests of the integrity of the research and the potential interests of other parties.If information available to the DVC R&E calls into question the validity of one or more research publications the Terms of Reference may extend to the investigation of research beyond that covered by the Preliminary Inquiry.The Terms of Reference established by the DVC R&E for a Formal Investigation may allow it to be conducted without procedural formality but shall: clearly state the specific allegations which are being investigatedempower the Investigation Panel to require any member of the University to give oral evidence before it and/or to produce any material or other records in their possession relating to the matters at issue, and to require the researcher to repeat an experiment for the Investigation Panel where this is appropriaterequire that all relevant material which is to be available to the Investigation Panel is disclosed to the researcherentitle the researcher to meet with the Investigation Panel with the assistance of legal representation to present a response to the allegations under investigation.The Investigation Panel shall provide the Terms of Reference to the researcher involved and shall complete its investigation into matters in accordance with those terms following such reasonable process as deals with the matters expeditiously while ensuring fairness to all interested parties.The Investigation Panel may at any time seek amendment or extension of their Terms of Reference. The DVC R&E shall seek and take into account the views of the researcher before making any such change.\n6. Action following the Formal Investigation\nThe decision of the Formal Investigation will take the form of findings on any allegations made and recommendations to the DVC R&E as to action that might be taken.If an allegation is not proven: the researcher shall be entitled to have this recorded, and to have all information put forward in the process managed in a manner that appropriately protects the interests of those involvedthe DVC R&E shall give consideration to any redress that may be appropriate for the researcher.If the investigation suggests any allegation was made in bad faith, the DVC R&E shall give consideration to referring the matter to the Vice Chancellor for appropriate process to be followed.If the allegation is proven the DVC R&E: shall refer the matter if it involves a member of staff to the Vice-Chancellor for action to be considered under the researcher's employment agreement or independent contract or for other legal action to be consideredin the case of any matter involving a student, shall exercise any of the powers established by clause 5.7(b) to (f) of the Academic Statute 2011shall determine what information, if any, should be released, having regard to the interests of all concerned. This shall include determining whether funding agencies and publishers need to be informed that research and publications may have resulted from misconducted researchshall determine any steps that may be required to address the position of past and present co-workers in relation to the misconduct.\n7. Acknowledgement of misconduct by researcher\nIf at any point a researcher acknowledges that their actions represent misconduct in research the DVC R&E may suspend the operation of these procedures as they relate to a Preliminary Inquiry and/or Formal Investigation, and instead shall arrange for a report to be prepared recording the circumstances and the researcher's acknowledgment.A report prepared under clause 7(a) shall be supplied to the researcher who shall be: advised of their right to seek legal advice or other supportinvited to provide written acknowledgement of their acceptance of the terms of the report.If a researcher accepts a report in accordance with clause 7(b)ii the matter shall be dealt with under clause 6(d) on the basis of that report.\n8.Interim measures\nAt any stage of the processes under these procedures relevant funding agencies may need to be informed that an investigation is in progress. Any decision to make such disclosure shall be made by the DVC R&E.If at any time it appears to those undertaking a Preliminary Inquiry or Formal Investigation, or to the DVC R&E, that there may be grounds to suspend the researcher's employment, contract or enrolment while these procedures are followed, the DVC R&E shall refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor to be addressed in accordance with the researcher's employment or contractual terms, or enrolment status.",

        "scope": "This procedure applies to any part of the University engaged in research with responsibility for project management and/or reporting.",
        "content": "Interim or final reporting\nFunders often require a financial report and those providing funding in a foreign currency require the report to be completed in the funding currency. Reports may be completed at specified dates during the life of the project and/or at its conclusion. Reporting requirements are described in the project contract.\nWhen completing financial reports in a foreign currency, identify the foreign currency amount(s) received in the reporting period from the finance system. Expenses shown on the project statement for the reporting period are converted to the funding currency using the budgeted rate shown on the CCW.\nConcluding the project\nCalculate Exchange Gain or Loss on Funding.\nThe University assumes foreign exchange risk when it enters into a contract that stipulates it will be paid in foreign currency. The risk arises from movements in the exchange rate. The CCW for the project will assume a fixed rate of exchange when the project budget and funding application is completed. The University will receive either more or less funding when measured in New Zealand dollars if the exchange rate is different from planned when the funding is received. Since the funding is fixed in the foreign amount, the University does not have recourse to be reimbursed for any loss. Exchange gains are also retained by the University on the same basis.\nBefore beginning\n\nEnsure the project balance is final\nDetermine if the funder is entitled to any surplus with reference to the contract\nConsult the signed CCW to confirm the budgeted exchange rate\nRun a project life-to-date report from the reports menu in Finance One\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Exchange Gain or Loss on Funding \u2013 this amount is the University's\n\nIdentify the foreign amounts received using the enquiry function in Finance One for each year the project was running also noting the NZD equivalent. If the total of the NZD equivalent matches the life-to-date report, then all the foreign amounts have been identified\nConvert the total of the foreign amount received to NZD using the budgeted exchange rate from the CCW\n\nIf the NZD amount shown on the life-to-date report is larger than the amount calculated, the University has earned an exchange gain.  Conversely, if the amount calculated is more than the amount shown on the life-to-date report, the University has suffered an exchange loss\n\nStep 2:  Determine the Project Over or Under Spend\n\nUsing the life-to-date report, determine whether the amount spent in NZD is larger or smaller than the budgeted amount\nNothing is refundable if the amount spent is larger than the amount budgeted in NZD. This difference is a project overspend (i.e. deficit) for which the Cost Centre is responsible\nA project under spend has occurred if the amount spent in NZD is smaller than the budgeted amount in NZD. This amount is either refundable to the funder or may be retained by the Cost Centre as described in the project contract\n\nStep 3:  Complete the Project Closing Form\nThe exchange gain or loss on funding is charged to the Department using dissection code 7516 in the project and crediting 7116 in the Department.  Losses are closed crediting dissection 3281 in the project and debiting it in the Department.  Indicate the account code and amount of the gain or loss on the project closing form.\nIf the project under spend is to be refunded, follow the Credit Note procedure.  A credit note is entered against the last invoice recorded in the Accounts Receivable system.  Dissection 1321 is generally used.\nAny project under spend that is retained is entered on the project closing form along with the account code to receive it.  The same holds true for any amount overspent.\nCompleted project closing forms are forwarded to the Research and Enterprise Office who in turn provide a copy to the Financial Services Division.  The Financial Services Division will enter the amounts shown on the closing form to the account codes specified.\nResponsibilities\nThe calculation of the exchange gain or loss and the project under or over spend is part of the project management responsibility undertaken in the Cost Centre.\nThe credit note is usually prepared by the Research Office.  The supporting calculation is sent from the Cost Centre to the Research Office, if that office is completing the credit note, to attach to the transaction.  The Department attaches the calculation to the credit note transactions if it prepares the credit note.\nUse the worksheet at the end of this procedure to calculate the exchange gain or loss and the over or under spend on the project.  Double click anywhere on the worksheet to open Excel and complete the shaded boxes.  Print the worksheet to attach to the closing form or to scan it to be attached to the credit note.\nExamples\nExample 1 \u2013 An exchange gain and a project under spend\nAssume a project has received an award for USD $100k and the budgeted exchange rate is $0.83 (one NZD buys USD 0.83) producing budgeted revenue of $120k in NZD. Over the life of the project the funding received when measured in NZD was $125k. Lastly, assume that the amount spent was $115k.\nThe exchange gain on the funding was $5k and this amount always belongs to the University.  The amount is determined by comparing the amount budgeted to be received ($120k) to the amount actually received ($125k).\n\n\nExchange Rate per CCW\n\n0.83\n\n\nAmount funded in foreign currency\n100,000\n\n\nBudgeted funded in NZD\n\n120,000\n\n\nActual funding in NZD\n\n125,000\n\n\nCurrency gain or (loss)\n5,000\n\n\nThe amount to be returned to the funder at the end of the project is NZD $5k which is the budgeted spend of $120k in New Zealand dollars less the actual spend of $115k in New Zealand dollars.  A credit note is processed for $5,000.  Please refer to the Projects Account Refund Procedure for instructions on creating a credit note in a foreign currency.\n\n\nBudgeted Expenditure\n120,000\n\n\nActual Expenditure\n115,000\n\n\nRefundable (non-refundable)\n5,000\n\n\nExample 2 - An exchange loss and a project over spend\nAssume the same facts as in Example 1 except that over the life of the project the NZD equivalent of the funding received was $117k and the expenses incurred were $123k.\nThe exchange loss on the funding was $3k determined as the amount received of $117k less the budgeted amount to be received of $120k.\n\n\nExchange Rate per CCW\n\n0.83\n\n\nAmount funded in foreign currency\n100,000\n\n\nBudgeted funding in NZD\n\n120,000\n\n\nActual funding in NZD\n\n117,000\n\n\nCurrency gain or (loss)\n-3,000\n\n\nThe project over spend is the amount that was budgeted of $120k less the $123k that was spent.\n\n\nBudgeted Expenditure\n120,000\n\n\nActual Expenditure\n123,000\n\n\nRefundable (non refundable)\n-3,000\n\n",

        "content": "SummaryThe University Council is required to approve on an annual basis those papers and programmes of study which are to have limitations on their enrolment numbers due to insufficiency of resources (see Education and Training Act 2020 section 255(4) and clause 10.1 of the Admission to University Statute 2011).Limitations may include specified international places, but only where the ongoing offering of these places is dependent on the payment of fees by the international students who enrol in them (that is, if international students did not continue to enrol in these places over time, the places would need to be disestablished on financial grounds). Such places must be approved by the University Council.Heads of Academic Departments who consider limitation on enrolments in specific papers and/or programmes to be required must obtain approval each year under the process outlined in clause 2 below.The approval of enrolment limitations must be completed in sufficient time to enable the information to be available to prospective students for papers or programmes in respect of which limitations are sought to apply.Approval processEach year, Divisional Offices shall make available to their departments information on the approval process, including the timeframes for application and the criteria for consideration. Consideration of proposed limitations of enrolment outside of the usual approval period shall only be made in exceptional circumstances.For any new limitation of enrolment (including a change of conditions for a paper or programme for which enrolment is already limited) a Limitation of Enrolment form must be completed. This must be endorsed by the relevant Head of Department and Pro-Vice-Chancellor and shall include: the resource-related justification(s) for imposing the limitation on enrolment, which must relate to the availability of staffing, accommodation or equipment;the recommended number of enrolments allowed for the paper or programme;where applicable, a recommendation to establish specified international places, and confirmation that these meet the criteria laid out under clause 1(b); andcriteria for selecting applicants for the places available in the paper or programme.By the deadline advised under clause 2(a), each Division shall provide to the Academic Committees Office a Pro-Vice-Chancellor-endorsed list of all papers and/or programmes for which limitations are being sought. This shall include: the total maximum enrolment numbers for each included paper or programme;where applicable, recommended specified international place numbers (as a subset of the total maximum enrolment numbers); andcopies of Limitation of Enrolment forms for any new limitations on enrolment (see 2(b) above).For continuing limitations, Pro-Vice-Chancellor endorsement shall confirm that the grounds for the existing limitation and for the establishment of any specified international places continue to apply.Limitations of enrolment, supported by material provided under clause 2(c), shall be considered by Senate and Council, with Council having the final power of approval. Material will also be provided for information to the Academic Committee.With respect to maximum enrolment numbers, approvals granted under this process shall be considered to grant approval consequentially for any necessary updating of programme regulations or paper prescriptions.Selection of students for limited placesSelection criteria must be consistent with the provisions in any relevant programme regulations.The basic criteria for selection of students for available places in papers and programmes with limitations on enrolment shall be academic merit and suitability for the paper or programme.Any additional selection criteria must be endorsed by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and approved by Senate. Application for approval of such criteria can be made on the Limitation of Enrolment form; justification for the additional criteria must be provided. The Academic Committees Office will arrange for consideration of the proposed selection criteria by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and Senate.Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses 3(b) and 3(c), the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) and Senate have issued a standing approval for the following criteria in relation to the selection of students for limited places in Summer School papers, or second semester papers where enrolment has been sought after the closing date for first semester enrolments: In cases where the timing of application makes assessment against other applicants impractical, the order of application may be used, with those completing their application first being given preference. In such cases a grade minimum may also be used (i.e. students applying first who meet a minimum grade requirement will be given preference), so long as this does not prevent available places being filled.For Summer School papers, applicants whose proposed enrolment would complete their degree may be given preference.Except when selecting for specific international places established by Council, first preference for limited places must be given to qualified domestic applicants.The selection criteria for papers or programmes with limitations on enrolment shall be made available in University publications, on the University website and/or through the University's Student Management System (eVision).",

        "name": "Mass_Student_Email_and_Digital_Screen_Procedures",
        "scope": "The policy applies University-wide to all mass communications to students, other than those sent by a division, department, University of Otago campus outside of Dunedin or other administrative unit to students enrolled in that unit's area of oversight (e.g. the International Office emailing all international students).",
        "content": "1. Mass emails\nThe use of this service is for University purposes only (academic, administrative, support services and research) but not to promote University papers or programmes.Mass emails to large groups of students should be used only for matters of substance which are relevant, or potentially relevant, to all students in that group.Mass emails require the prior approval of the Director, Student and Academic Services.The process for sending mass emails to all students or a specific group (excluding emailed invitations to participate in research \u2013 see sub-clause (e) below), is as follows: Email the Director, Student and Academic Services with a brief outline of the intended recipients and message.If approved, a template text to collect all required information will be provided.Once the completed template is returned, the Director will initiate sending of the email. This may take approximately 3-4 days (the timeframe may be longer during busy periods or if the request is not straightforward).Email invitations to students inviting participation in research require the endorsement of the Administrator of the University of Otago Human Ethics Committees, and will only be sent if required ethical approval has been obtained.\u00a0\u00a0The process is as follows: Email a completed Student Research Invitation Email Request Form to the Administrator of the Ethics Committees.If approved, the email invitation will be sent via Student and Academic Services. This may take approximately 3-4 days (the timeframe may be longer during busy periods, if the request is not straightforward, or if the request is subject to prioritisation to reduce student email traffic at busy or critical periods of the year).\n2. Scarfie.com electronic newsletter\nCommunications to students that do not meet the criteria for mass emails may be acceptable for inclusion in the fortnightly scarfie.com electronic newsletter to all Dunedin students. Items from the community may be included to foster community engagement eg NZ Blood Service campus visits.The process for submitting items for scarfie.com is as follows: All items for scarfie.com must be submitted by the relevant Divisional representatives whose names are listed here.All items for scarfie.com must be received by the due date listed here.All items received will be viewed by the Director, Student and Academic Services and if not approved the submitter will be notified.\n3. Networked digital screen messages\nDuring normal operations, Divisions, departments, University of Otago campuses outside of Dunedin, or other administrative units are responsible for all messages on their own networked digital screens.\u00a0\u00a0Information about digital screens (Otago Signage) is available here.Screen messages to all students should be used only for matters of substance relevant to the entire student body. To request that such a message be displayed on screens outside one's own area, email Otago signage.If a state of Campus Emergency is declared, all networked digital screens will be taken over for emergency communications and remain under the jurisdiction of the Emergency Communications team for the duration of the event.In the case of a possible medical emergency, all networked digital screens will give priority to safety and health messages as requested by the ECT.",

While the goal of these cross-references is to provide additional context, they can be considered unnecessary content as they may confuse readers who are not familiar with the referenced policies.\n\nHowever, I would like to note that some cross-references might be necessary for clarity and consistency in communication. But overall, this policy contains some extraneous information that could be removed without affecting its core purpose.\n\n2. 'Scarfie.com electronic newsletter' - This policy also contains a cross-reference (referencing the \"NZ Blood Service campus visits\" which is not provided in the data), but I will only confirm whether it has any other unnecessary content: \n\nIn this case, there are also some sentences that seem extraneous or repetitive (\"Items from the community may be included to foster community engagement\"), and the formatting could be improved.\n\nBut overall, these policies contain some redundant or supplementary information that could be removed without significantly impacting their purpose.",

While these cross-references may be necessary for clarity and consistency in communication, they can also be considered unnecessary content.\n* The 'Scarfie.com electronic newsletter' policy also contains some extraneous information, such as sentences that seem repetitive, and formatting issues could be improved.\n\nThe 'Networked digital screen messages' policy does not appear to have any unnecessary content beyond what is necessary for clarity and consistency in communication. \n\nHowever, there are a few more policies mentioned in the provided JSON data but not shown here:\n\n* Policy name: Mass_Student_Email_and_Digital_Screen_Procedures\n* Scope: The policy applies University-wide to all mass communications to students, other than those sent by a division, department, University of Otago campus outside of Dunedin or other administrative unit to students enrolled in that unit's area of oversight.\n* Content: ...

        "q4_response": "After carefully reviewing the provided JSON data, I have identified the following redundancy or incorrect structure of policies:\n\n1. **Redundant cross-references**: All three policies ('Mass_Student_Email_and_Digital_Screen_Procedures', 'Scarfie.com electronic newsletter', and implicitly 'Networked digital screen messages') contain unnecessary cross-references to other policies or procedures. While these cross-references may be necessary for clarity and consistency in communication, they can be considered redundant and may confuse readers who are not familiar with the referenced policies.\n\n2. **Overlapping policies**: The scope of 'Mass_Student_Email_and_Digital_Screen_Procedures' seems to overlap with other policies. For example, the 'Scarfie.com electronic newsletter' policy explicitly mentions including items from the community, which is also mentioned in 'Networked digital screen messages'. This duplication may not be necessary.\n\n3. **Unclear scope**: The scope of 'Mass_Student_Email_and_Digital_Screen_Procedures' seems to include both mass emails and scarfie.com electronic newsletters, but it's unclear why these would be treated differently. It might be more consistent to have a single policy that covers all forms of mass communication.\n\n4. **Unnecessary repetition**: Some policies contain repetitive information or sentences (e.g., 'Items from the community may be included to foster community engagement' in 'Scarfie.com electronic newsletter'). Removing such extraneous information would make the policies more concise and easier to read.\n\n5. **Lack of clear hierarchy**: The data does not show a clear hierarchy between the policies, which could lead to confusion or inconsistency in how these policies are applied. It might be helpful to establish a clear order of precedence among these policies.\n\nTo improve the structure of the policy database, it could be beneficial to:\n\n* Consolidate overlapping policies (e.g., 'Mass_Student_Email_and_Digital_Screen_Procedures' and 'Scarfie.com electronic newsletter') into a single policy.\n* Remove redundant cross-references and clarify how these policies interact with each other.\n* Establish a clear hierarchy among the policies, if necessary.\n* Eliminate unnecessary repetition in the policies."

        "content": "1. Responsibilities of staff and the University\nUniversity staff are expected to comply with their contractual and professional obligations within the context provided by the University. The following responsibilities should be read in conjunction with the policies referenced.\nStaff will comply with the Provision of Course and Study Information to Enrolled Students Policy, including: providing course/paper information to students in a timely manner (no later than the first week of semester for taught papers);making clear the University's expectations with respect to acceptable academic practice as per the Academic Integrity Policy;making arrangements to ensure that for each paper there are academic staff who are reasonably and regularly available during teaching weeks to respond to and/or discuss matters which students may raise (e.g. through staff office hours).Staff will adhere to the Guidelines for the Assessment of Student Performance, including: devising and administering appropriate assessment tasks which centre on essential knowledge and skills and which are appropriate to the level of the paper under consideration;being cognisant of student workload both within and across papers in the setting of assessment tasks and deadlines;providing appropriate and timely feedback on assessment tasks.The University will provide adequate and appropriate course advice to students consistent with the Student Advising Guidelines.The University will respect students' rights to express views and opinions.\n2. Responsibilities of students\nStudents are expected to fulfil the following obligations:\nStudents have a responsibility to participate actively and positively in their learning. It is expected that students will apply themselves to their study to the best of their ability, attend classes, maintain steady progress within the subject framework, respond to feedback provided, comply with workload expectations and submit required work on time.As per the Provision of Course and Study Information to Enrolled Students Policy, students are responsible for making themselves aware of all University rules and regulations pertaining to their rights and responsibilities as students and the degree for which they are enrolled, and are deemed to be aware of paper information made available to them.Students are responsible for their overall course planning and for monitoring their progress in their academic programme.Students are expected to respect the right of staff members to express views and opinions.Students are expected to take the initiative and consult appropriately when problems arise.\n3. Due process\nHoD s and PVC s are expected to receive, consider and investigate academic grievances made in writing in an open and honest way, to allow the student complainant to have a support person or whanau support at any meeting, and to be sensitive to power imbalances which may exist between students and staff.HoD s and PVC s are expected, as regards any staff implicated in a complaint, to follow the principles of natural justice by: giving notice to the staff member or staff members of any complaint against them as soon as is reasonably practicable, if it is to be investigated;before finalising any finding which may reflect adversely on a staff member, informing the staff member of the proposed outcome and allowing them the opportunity to comment, provide evidence on the matter and/or add their version of events to the record;formally recording any finding which relates to the performance of a staff member.No finding by any HoD or PVC from these proceedings can be used as a surrogate for standard disciplinary procedures in relation to the staff member concerned without being proved afresh.\n4. Procedure\nAny student who seeks the resolution of an academic grievance must follow the steps set out below. Students may seek advice and support from the OUSA Student Support Centre at any stage of the process. Staff or students may contact the University Mediator to seek assistance with the resolution of interpersonal issues as appropriate.\nStep 1 The student should, where possible and within a reasonable timeframe, attempt to resolve the grievance with the staff member(s) concerned.If the student's grievance relates to research Master's or doctoral-level study and the matter cannot be resolved directly with the staff member(s) concerned, the student should seek assistance from the postgraduate coordinator in their department. If a satisfactory resolution still cannot be reached, the student should raise their concerns with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who is empowered to make recommendations to departments to assist with the resolution of graduate research candidate issues.Step 2 If the matter remains unresolved, the student should complain to the HoD . If the student is uncomfortable complaining directly he/she may wish to contact a student advocate, such as the student representative for the paper concerned or an OUSA support person, who can raise the issue on the student's behalf. The student may initially meet with the HoD . If the matter cannot be resolved easily and is to be fully investigated, the complaint must be made formally in writing. Written complaints should detail the precise grounds of the complaint and provide objective evidence where appropriate.Complaints under Step 2 will normally only be considered if they are made within one month of the events complained about or within ten working days of the completion of Step 1 (whichever is later). This restriction may be waived if there are good reasons for the delay in making a complaint.If the complaint involves the HoD , the student may complain to the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor ( PVC ) who shall appoint an independent party to substitute for the HoD , and that party shall investigate the complaint using the process described under clause 4(b)v below.If the HoD considers they have a conflict of interest with regards to a complaint, they should advise their PVC who shall appoint an independent party to substitute for the HoD , and that party shall investigate the complaint using the process described under clause 4(b)v below.The HoD or nominated party: must decide whether or not to investigate the complaint; and if somust give notice to any affected staff member entitled to it under clause 3(b)i of these Procedures;must liaise with relevant parties, including the student and affected staff, and consider relevant documentary evidence (e.g. relevant email communications, student teaching evaluations provided by staff, etc.) to ensure that any findings or outcomes are based on a thorough and balanced investigation of the complaint;can make formal recommendations to the involved parties with a view to resolving the dispute (this may include exploring mediation, for example with the assistance of the University Mediator);can make findings about particular disputed matters;must, before making any findings, give notice to any staff member entitled to it under section 3 (b)ii;must conclude any investigation by compiling a record of the investigation, including any agreements reached, any findings made, any steps taken as a result of those findings, and the reasons for any such steps taken;can take steps within the HoD 's ordinary powers which are the appropriate consequence of the findings or any agreement reached;must appropriately inform the student and any staff members who are the subject of the complaint of the outcome of the investigation, including providing a written statement of their findings.Step 3 If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome of the complaint, the student can, within ten working days of receiving written notification of the outcome, request in writing that the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor ( PVC ) review the outcome.If a staff member against whom a grievance was directed is dissatisfied with any of the findings of the HoD , the staff member can, within ten working days of receiving written notification of the outcome, request in writing that the PVC review the findings.The PVC may appoint a nominee to act on their behalf with regards to the review, in which case that nominee shall be responsible for the process as outlined under clauses 4(c)iv-v below (the nominee may not have acted for the HoD under clauses 4(b)iii or 4(b)iv above).The PVC or their nominee will, within ten working days of receiving written notice requesting a review, arrange to meet and discuss the issue with the student or staff member requesting the review. They will also meet with the Head of the relevant department (or the HoD 's nominee responsible for the initial findings). After these meetings, they will consider their response.The PVC or their nominee: may decline the request for a review from the student or staff member, in which case a written reason for this decision must be provided to the party requesting the review;may review the initial investigation, findings and outcomes, which shall include consideration of the documentation from the initial investigation carried out under clause 4(b) ('Step 2'), and may include further investigation by the PVC ; and if somay invite the parties involved to meet to attempt to facilitate a solution agreed to by all involvedmay endorse the original findings and the outcomes resulting from those findings;may overrule the initial findings and/or outcomes, in which case they must give notice to any staff member entitled to it under section 3 (b)ii, including the HoD or nominee who carried out the investigation, before finalising any revised findings;can take steps within the PVC 's ordinary powers which are the appropriate consequence of any revised findings;must conclude any review by compiling a record of the review, including any agreements reached, any findings made, any steps taken as a result of those findings, and the reasons for any such steps taken;must appropriately inform relevant parties of the outcome of the review, including providing a written statement of their findings.\n5.

        "content": "1. Requirements of legislation\nFor policy and proceduresUnder the Education Act 1989 (as amended by the Education Amendment Act 1990), the University is defined as a body corporate (s166) with the Council as the governing authority (s165). Power is vested in the Council but any of its functions or powers (except the power to appoint a Chief Executive) may be delegated in accordance with S222 to the Chief Executive, who in turn may delegate to members of staff.For fundingThe Tertiary Education Commission is responsible for allocating the University its core Government funding. The Tertiary Education Commission is subject to the Public Finance Act under which Vote Education is appropriated and distributed.For reportingThe Education and Training Act 2020 (S305) deems all tertiary institutions to be crown entities in terms of the Public Finance Act 1989 ( PFA ). Section 43 of the PFA requires that Crown Entities prepare financial statements. The form of these statements must comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ( GAAP ) which in turn is defined in the Financial Reporting Act 2013. GAAP is defined by reference to approved accounting standards and authoritative support within the New Zealand accounting profession.The Annual Report includes: financial statements including a Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Accounting Policiesnon-financial statements (called Service Performance Reporting) documenting the achievements of the University against the objectives approved by Council and presented to the Tertiary Education Commission.The annual report is subject to audit. S156(1) of the Crown Entities Act 2004 states that the draft report must be provided to the Auditor-General within 3 months of the end of the financial year. S156 states that the Auditor-General must provide an audit report within 4 months of the end of the financial year (31 December). The University and Auditor-General currently determine the reporting and audit schedule to ensure that these timeframes are met.Section 306 of the Education and Training Act 2020 requires that the University Council lodges their final audited report with the Minister as soon as practicable after completion of the report. S150 of the Crown Entities Act 2004 states that this must be lodged with the responsible Minister no later than 14 days after receiving the audit report. This is actioned by the Registrar and Secretary to the Council.\n2. Service Performance Reporting\nSection 306 of the Education and Training Act 2020 identifies several non-financial items that must be included in the annual reporting, including that a Statement of Objectives is prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice and S153 of the Crown Entities Act 2004. A requirement to include reporting by output class is one of the key requirements of S153 of the Crown Entities Act 2004.The relevant standard for reporting service performance under GAAP is PBEFRS 48, which has been in force for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021. PBEFRS 48 provides flexibility for entities to determine how best to report service performance information and \u201ctell their story\u201d to external stakeholders. Details of the judgements and determinations made in applying this standard, including alignment with the University\u2019s strategy and Tertiary Education Commission requirements, are documented in the University\u2019s Service Performance Reporting Methodology, which is published on the University\u2019s website.The University defines its outputs as: Teaching and Learning including: Campus Based Teaching and LearningDistance Teaching and LearningResearch including: Postgraduate Thesis SupervisionTeaching Related ResearchProject Based ResearchCommunity Services including: Community Continuing EducationCommunity Cultural EventsCommunity Science EventsThe provision of University expertise for public-good purposes",

The person providing the endorsement must not be a close relative of the applicant.Staff involved in the administration of processes which include verification of indigenous Pacific ancestry may confirm ancestry on the basis of documentation and/or endorsement provided under clauses 3(a) and (b). However, where there is doubt over the verification of ancestry, staff should refer the case to the Pacific Ancestry Verification Committee for a decision.The Pacific Verification Ancestry Committee shall comprise: the Director, Pacific Development (Chair)the Associate Dean (Pacific) from each Academic Divisionthe Manager, Pacific Islands Centre, andthe Pacific Community Liaison Officer.Additional members may be co-opted as required to ensure diverse representation of specific Island nations on the Committee.The Pacific Verification Ancestry Committee shall determine whether ancestry may be deemed to be verified in all cases: in which neither verified official documentation nor community group leader endorsement can be provided, and/orwhich are referred to it under clause 3(c).The Pacific Verification Ancestry Committee shall schedule meetings with reference to the timing of administrative processes likely to require assessment of indigenous Pacific ancestry (e.g. scholarship selection, programme admission).Where an assessment is necessary between scheduled meetings, a decision on whether ancestry can be verified may be made by the Chair (or their nominee) and at least two other members of the Committee, one of whom should preferably have knowledge of the student's Pacific community.

Cost centres ensure that the project balances are final and the Research Office prepares the credit note",

This balance may have arisen because the amount funded was different from the amount budgeted; the amount spent was different from the amount budgeted; or a combination of the two.  When a project concludes with a surplus, that is the amount spent is less than the amount funded, the surplus may have to be returned to the funder.  The project contract should be consulted to determine whether the funder or the University owns the surplus or if the right to retain the surplus must be negotiated with the funder.\nDebtor Accounts\nAll funders should have a Debtors Account created at the time the contract for service is signed.  Invoices are issued using the Finance One system for all amounts receivable under the terms of the contract.\nFollow the steps below once it has been confirmed that the project surplus is to be refunded.\nStep 1: Ensure that the project balance is final\n\nIf the project was funded in foreign currency refer to the procedure Reporting on Foreign Funded Research Projects\nAll funding has been invoiced and received\nAll supplier invoices have been recorded or amounts accrued\nAnnual leave has been accounted for\nService divisions have been notified that the project is closed\nThere are no commitments listed on the project's financial reports\nIf the project is currently active, ask DMU to inactivate the project\n\nStep 2: Determine the refundable amount\n\nRun the project life-to-date report from the reports menu in Finance One\nIdentify the amount in the Operating Surplus (Deficit) line and the Act+Comm column of the report.  If the amount is without brackets, the project has finished with a surplus and is the amount to be returned to the funder unless a different lower amount has been negotiated\n\nStep 3: Creation of the credit note\nCredit notes are used to cancel invoices either in whole or part.  A credit note for the refund is to be linked with the last invoice issued.\n\nRefer to the Finance One Accounts Receivable Manual for instructions on how to create a credit note\nCreate the credit note and attach any supporting documentation that explains why a credit is being entered to the funder's account. The documentation may include making use of the Notes feature to type a full and complete description of the refund     Use the attachment feature to include any important documents, calculations or emails relating to the refund.     Credit notes must contain sufficient documentation to allow the reviewer in Financial Services to understand both the amount and reason for the refund.\n\nStep 4: Notify the Revenue Management Office\nAdvise Financial Services Division, Revenue Management Office (RMO) that the credit needs to be repaid to the funder.  The RMO will complete an AR Adjustment which transfers the Debtor Account credit to the clearing account 10.BS.C05.8206.00.\nFinancial Services Division Accounts Payable staff will scan an invoice form prepared by the RMO staff to relieve the clearing account and create a balance to be paid on either the Debtor's Creditor Account or a Sundry Creditor Account.\nThe balance is paid out in the next Creditors payment run.",

        "content": "1. Internal Transactions \u2013 Use of the 7000 Dissection Range\nEach income (credit) dissection in the 7000 dissection range has a corresponding expense (debit) dissection. Transactions should be coded such that these associated income and expense dissections are in balance (i.e., credits = debits). There can be no one-sided 7000 services transactions, apart from (and this is the only exception) internal charging to fixed assets, using the 7399 dissection.Internal Income (credit) is a dissection within the range 7100 to 7499.Internal Expenditure (debit) is a dissection within the range 7500 to 7899.The difference between the two credit and debit account codes must always be 400, for example: DR to dissection 7775 (Internal General Paid) must have a corresponding CR to dissection 7375 (Internal General Recovery).DR to dissection 7531 (Internal Grant Paid) must have a corresponding CR to dissection 7131 (Internal Grant Recovery).\nPlease note: The 7000 series dissections must not be used when coding Debtor invoices, Creditor Invoices and P Card transactions.\n2.Internal Transactions \u2013 7000 Dissection Range \u2013 Use of sub dissections\nWhen using the internal transaction dissections (7000 range) you must use the sub dissection 70 (transactions within your Cost Centre), 71 (transactions within your division), or 72 (transactions between your division and another). No other sub dissections should be used.\n3.Internal Recharging of Expenditure\nWhere an expense is incurred by one Activity Centre and they wish to charge all or part of that expense to another Activity Centre (which may or may not be in the same division) then the debit and credit should go to the same account in the originator\u2019s ledger. However, where the originating Activity Centre adds value to the cost before passing it on, the debit and credit should go to the internal income dissection. Please note, the sub dissection 70 (transactions within your Cost Centre), 71 (transactions within your division), or 72 (transactions between your division and another) is also required to complete the transaction.Marking up is not adding value. Example \u2013 no added value Activity Centre 10 WF C01 photocopies documents for 10 GF C01. The WF C01 photocopying costs accumulate in 10 WF C01 3115 00. The journal to charge GF C01 will be: Debit 10 GF C01 3115 00 - $100Credit 10 WF C01 3115 00 - $100Example \u2013 added value: Activity Centre 10 WF C01 photocopies documents for 10 GF C01 (in another division) but adds a cover sheet and binds the documents. The WF C01 photocopying costs accumulate in 10 WF C01 3115 00. The journal to charge GF C01 will be: Debit 10 GF C01 7775 72 $110Credit 10 WF C01 7375 72 $110\n4.Internal Recharging of Expenditure\nOperational Income and Expenditure (dissections 1100 to 7999): A bracket around a figure, or a minus sign in front of a figure, indicates that the figure is income to the University.A figure without a bracket around it or no minus sign in front of it indicates that the figure is expenditure to the University.Balance Sheet Assets (dissections 8100 to 8999) and Liabilities (dissections 9100 to 9899): A figure without a bracket around it or not minus sign in front of it, indicates the amount is an asset to the University.A figure with a bracket around it or a minus sign in front of it, indicates the amount is a liability to the University.Balance Sheet Equity (dissections 9900 to 9999): A figure in these dissections with a bracket around it or a minus sign in front of it indicates there are (positive) carry forwards available to the Activity Centre/department for its use.A figure in these dissections without a bracket around it or without a minus sign in front of it indicates there are no (negative) carry forwards available to the Activity Centre/department for its use.\n5.Accounting for Conference\nThere are several methods of accounting for conferences, depending on the type and nature of the conference: A conference which is run by the University, is community oriented and is open to members of the public. Any surplus or shortfall belongs to the University. These accounts should be set up using a K activity (e.g., K01).A conference which is run by the University and is aimed at university staff, external people, organisations, academics, and specialists. Any surplus or shortfall belongs to the University. These accounts should be set up using a D activity (e.g., D01).Accounting for a conference which is being run on behalf of another organisation and the surplus or shortfall belongs to that organisation. All transactions relating to this type of conference must be coded to the balance sheet (dissection 9259 \u2013 Agency Clearing Accounts Sundry). This is achieved by requesting the Financial Accountant to create a conference account.Amounts coded to the 9259 account must be GST inclusive.The University may not claim GST on any expenses for the conference and should not declare GST on conference income received. If the other organisation is registered for GST, then it must account for the GST and any other related taxes itself. The University is obligated to provide a fully summary of all transactions to the organisation monthly, so that it may appropriately account for its GST claims and declarations.Because the University is acting on behalf of the organisation running the conference, all invoices should be raised using the organisation's letterhead, and must not be processed through Finance One.To facilitate the payment of conference fees, departments can make use of the University of Otago Credit Card Gateway which provides a mechanism for departments within the University to process credit card payments as a link from their website. It provides a secure mechanism for conference attendees to pay by credit card and ensure compliance with the obligations the University has made to the banks that clear the payments. The Gateway is integrated with the University journal accounting system so allows transaction details to appear on departmental accounts. Payments received via the gateway can be credited to the 9259 conference account. Receipts generated must be in the name of the organisation.Cashiers will also need to be informed of the 9259 conference account to be credited.If you wish to use this facility, please contact: The Cashiers Office Tel +64 3 479 8228 Email cashiers@otago.ac.nzIf a University of Otago department (e.g. University Union) supplies goods or services to a 9259 conference, the department should request, via current processes, that an external AR invoice be raised via Finance One and income should be coded to an external income code (as the conference is regarded as an external conference). The department should further request that Revenue Management create an ARADJ journal for the amount of the AR invoice ( GST inclusive). The adjustment will credit the debtor (GST inclusive) and debit the appropriate 9259 conference account (GST inclusive). For further information, contact the Revenue Management Accounts Receivable team on receivables@otago.ac.nzThe final amount owed by the University to the other organisation is paid through Accounts Payable by way of a \u201cNon-Staff Reimbursement\u201d payment (contact: accounts@otago.ac.nz for further guidance on this process of payment). GST should be # N/A . This AP payment should debit the 9259 account which should clear the balance.\n6.T Activities (little T\u2019s)\nT activities are tagged gifts and bequests, which are not Trusts, and are generally known as \u201clittle T\u2019s\u201d.T activity balances (which reside in the \u201cCarry Forward \u2013 Interest Bearing\u201d dissection 9962) are not required to be maintained permanently, and may be fully expended, provided the original purposes for which the funds were given by the donor are met.Authorised expenditure should be coded to the appropriate expenditure dissection within the T activity.The balance brough forward is updated (to the 9962 dissection) in period 1 and occurs in February each year.For further information, please contact: The Financial Accountant Email financial.accountant@otago.ac.nz",

General principles\nTo support compliance with the Privacy Act 2020 and the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement, it is the University's responsibility to ensure that, wherever possible, only staff members with a clear functional need to do so are able to access students' personal information.Operational responsibility for ensuring that only appropriate staff members are able to access student information in eVision resides with the relevant Head of Department.When assessing the need for a staff member to have access to eVision and/or associated Business Objects reports, the following question should be asked to inform the decision: To enable the employee to carry out the functions of his or her University employment, does the employee clearly need regular access to students' personal information and academic records?If the answer is 'yes', then access should be approved.If the answer is 'no', then access should not be approved. To enable the employee to carry out the functions of his or her University employment, does the employee clearly need regular access to students\u2019 personal information and academic records?Requests to create, change or remove eVision access for particular staff members, including access to associated Business Objects reports, may be made by completing and submitting the online eVision Access Form.The Manager of Student Administration has delegated authority to make a final decision on eVision access based on the criteria laid out in this Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0Depending upon the sensitivity and nature of the information being accessed, additional approval may also be required from designated managers with overall responsibility for particular sets of data.Staff members with approval to access student information in eVision may only access and use such information in accordance with the Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement.Where a staff member's access to information in eVision includes access to functionality that allows changing or updating information held in eVision, such functionality may only be used where this is authorised through the appropriate authority and/or clearly part of the staff member's functional role.\n2. Restrictions on access\nStaff members who, in order to undertake the responsibility of their positions, irregularly or infrequently need to access student personal information, should not be granted direct eVision access, but should instead access information via an Authorised Departmental Administrator.Student-staff members will not normally be granted eVision access.\u00a0\u00a0Where a student-staff member must access student information to carry out the functions of their employment, such information should be accessed via an Authorised Departmental Administrator.Notwithstanding clause 2(b), where it can be clearly demonstrated that a student-staff member cannot practically carry out the functions of their employment without eVision access, such access may be approved subject to the student-staff member signing a confidentiality agreement confirming that they have read and will adhere to the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement. Requests for eVision access for student-staff members, or for roles normally filled by student-staff members, should be made in writing to the Director, Academic Services.\n3. Removal of access\nWhere a staff member ceases employment at the University, eVision access will be removed via an automated updated at the end of their last day of work.\u00a0\u00a0For a short notice departure, or where a staff member's access needs to be removed immediately, their manager should contact the SMS Support Office to request this.Where a staff member is continuing in employment at the University but no longer requires eVision access as part of their role, their manager should remove access using the online eVision Access Form.Any staff member who has not accessed eVision within the last six months may have their access removed.A staff member's eVision access may be temporarily or permanently removed by the University where: It is deemed that they no longer require access to student informationthey have been shown to have accessed or used student information in contravention of the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement, orwhere the University deems that the staff member's continued access may pose an unacceptable risk to the privacy of students.",

The debtor account is used to make credit sales by raising an invoice against the account.  Existing accounts with a nil balance that have not had any activity for 18 months and no signed Debtor Account Application form is on file are made inactive.  The Accounts Receivable \u2013 Account Application \u2013 Research Funder form is used to request an account be reactivated.  The form is also used to have new debtors set up in the financial system.\nInvoicing\nAll revenue transactions are recorded in the University's financial system, Finance One, using an appropriate invoice format.  No off system invoices or emails should be made to customers to communicate amounts due or adjustments to amounts due.  Communication of amounts to be paid is always made via an invoice issued from Finance One.  The Accounts Receivable Procedure states that an \u201c\u2026invoice is required in all circumstances where a cash sale is not made.\u201d\nSome funders make regular electronic payments to the University.  These receipts also require an invoice.  This ensures that all revenue is properly documented and facilitates any future necessary account adjustments.  In these cases, an invoice would be generated against which payments are applied, but the invoice would not be sent to the customer.\nInvoices can only be sent to Funders once they have been reviewed and posted to the Finance One ledger by the Revenue Management Office. This is to ensure that any issues with the invoice can be resolved prior to the Funder receiving the invoice.\nCredit notes\nCredit notes are used to cancel invoices either in whole or in part and are used to:\n\nCorrect errors in the original invoice\nAccount for the return of unspent funds\nAmend the debtor account for a price dispute\n\nBecause GST is paid by the University to the IRD as soon as a GST invoice is issued it is important that any credit notes be issued promptly.\nCredit notes should not be sent to customers prior to posting for those reasons described in the invoicing section above.\nSee the Finance One Accounts Receivable Manual for information on how to create a credit note.\nRevenue Management Office, Financial Services Division\nMaintenance of debtor accounts\nThe Revenue Management Office is responsible for the maintenance of the debtors account list.

Retired staff will be paid an honorarium of $2,000 for panel members and $4,000 for panel convenors, in line with current external academic audit bodies.\nd.\tPanel Members from Outside Tertiary Education\nFor panel members from outside Tertiary Education, including former students, the University of Otago provides an honorarium in line with the current government advisory panels of $342.50 per day for a maximum of five days.\ne.\tReview Secretaries\nThe University of Otago recognises that review secretaries provide an invaluable support to the convenors and other panel members.  Staff who take on this role in addition to other employment within the University are provided with a one-off payment of $750 for each full review they undertake.  Review secretaries are not eligible for time off in lieu or overtime for the work of the review.  (This section does not apply to the permanent review secretaries within the Quality Advancement Unit.)\n2. \tGraduating Year Reviews\nFor Graduating Year Reviews (GYRs) the levels of remuneration are as detailed above. However, as the amount of work is less than a full review, the honorarium for retired staff acting as panel members is $250 per GYR and for retired staff acting as convenors is $500 per GYR.  External discipline specialists will be paid an honorarium of $171.25 for each GYR.\n3.\tProcessing and Taxing of Remuneration\nRemuneration of panel members and secretaries is managed and administered by the Quality Advancement Unit.  Like all review expenses, this remuneration is funded by the Divisions (although some exceptions apply).  Payment to convenors and panel members is via the \"Review Panel Member Honorarium Request Form\" and payment to secretaries is via the \"Review Secretary Payment Recommendation Form\".  All reviews remuneration is subject to tax; honoraria are scheduler payments subject to withholding tax and review secretary remuneration is subject to PAYE.

It would be more efficient to separate these two pieces of information into different sections or policies.\n\n2. **Lack of Clear Boundary**: The policy 'Equal_Employment_Opportunity_Data_Collection_Procedure' does not explicitly state who is responsible for implementing and enforcing the procedure.

It would be better to use a consistent term throughout the policy.\n\n7. **Missing Compliance Information**: While the policy mentions that statistics will be used by the University to plan and monitor progress towards its equity and diversity goals, it does not explicitly state how this information will be used or shared with external parties (e.g., government agencies). It would be beneficial to include more details on compliance requirements and data sharing practices.\n\n8. **Insufficient Contact Information**: The policy does not provide contact information for staff or other stakeholders who may have questions or concerns about the procedure. Providing clear contact information can help alleviate confusion and ensure a smooth implementation of the policy.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the policy can become more concise, easier to understand, and more effective in achieving its intended goals."

The CCW is prepared on a full cost basis, meaning all the direct and indirect costs are included, to determine the budgeted contribution the project is to make to the University.\nPricing\nCommercial projects have a profit element. The contracted price must be greater than the total cost of the project.\nOverhead waiver\nThe CCW allows the PI to recommend the waiver of overhead. Department overhead waivers are approved by the Head of Department (HOD) and Central overhead waivers by the DVC Research and Enterprise.  In the case of Health Sciences' projects, overhead waiver requests must be approved by the Dean or PVC in addition to the HOD.\nOverheads may only be waived if there is a clear and substantiated benefit to the University. Benefits may be tangible or intangible but should be expressed as an amount and compared to the value of the overhead waived.\nContracting\nA contract for each commercial project is required. Only the DVC Research and Enterprise, or delegate, may approve and sign a contract with a third party. The relationship is between the University and the contracting party.  Undertaking an activity outside of the contractual relationship can create legal and insurance issues. For example, the activity will fall outside of the University's insurance policy and may result in personal liability for the individual conducting the project.\nSet up in Finance One\nA commercial project is set up in the Finance One system as an E Activity Type. Completed applications to open an E Activity are signed by the HOD and sent to the Financial Accountant along with a copy of the last page of the CCW showing the summary budget and sign-offs. Spending must not take place prior to the activation of the E Activity, and all costs and revenue associated with the project must be recorded against the Activity.\nIf a new commercial project commences outside of the budget or budget review periods, Financial Services will open up the E Activity, but no budget may be loaded. A budget is still required, and will be loaded at the next budget or budget review round.\nProcedures followed during the life of the project\nThe following procedures are completed during the period the project is active through to its conclusion.\nProject monitoring\nDepartments are required to perform basic project administration including:\n\nInvoicing customers according to the requirements of the contract\nAll work must be completed at the contract price\nRecording indirect salary costs to the project by journal entry\nMonitoring project end dates to ensure that projects are completed and accounts closed in a timely manner\n\nIn addition to these administrative tasks, the Department needs to:\n\nVerify that overhead is calculated properly and any amount calculated over the waived amount is charged to the project\nRequest a rate change to the project when the commercial overhead rate changes and the project can bear the higher rate\nEnsure that projects continue to be viable. Where the planned return is unlikely to be achieved, the HOD and the Research Office should be informed, and a solution identified. Solutions may include an approach to the customer for additional funding, change in approach to the project or other opportunities\n\nCommercial surplus transfer and project closing\nThe Research and Enterprise website hosts transfer and closing forms that are completed to either transfer a surplus during the life of the project or to request a balance transfer and project closing at the conclusion of the project. Surpluses may not be transferred to another commercial project, an external research account (P or Q Activities), or a research committee account (R Activity).\nAt the project conclusion, the Department\n\nVerifies that all invoicing is complete and in accordance with the contract\nEnsures all indirect salaries and other costs are recorded\nMakes a comparison of actual results to budget\nCalculates overhead on a life to date basis to ensure that the correct amount based on actual salary costs has been charged and:     \nCharges overhead if the calculated amount exceeds the amount waived.\nRecovers overhead on projects with an overhead waiver when the project finishes in a surplus. The amount recovered is agreed between the Head of the Department and the Principal Investigator.\n\n\nProject deficits are followed up with the Principal Investigator and the Head of Department. A discussion should be held with the Research and Enterprise Office to determine the potential of recovering additional costs from the customer\n\nForms may be completed by the Department Administrator but must be signed by the Principal Investigator and the Head of Department. Completed forms are returned to the Enterprise Contracts Manager who will in turn supply the form for action to the Financial Services Division\nCarry forward\nThe actual surplus or deficit in an E Activity will carry forward to the next year.",

        "content": "1. Purchasing authority\nPurchases are to be initiated by staff and postgraduate students using an appropriate purchasing method as detailed in clause 2 below.All University purchases must be authorised by a Purchase Authority.The University Supply Chain (Purchasing) function is responsible for the establishment of systems to ensure the purchase of consumables or other goods and services by the University complies with policies, procedures and guidelines issued by the Financial Services Division.\n2. Purchasing methods\nThe University Purchasing system and the use of University Funds are not to be used for personal purchases.Requests to the Supply Chain Purchasing Team for goods and services to be purchased in support of University requirements can be made by any University staff member or postgraduate student using Unimarket.Every purchase by the University is to be undertaken through the use of an approved University purchasing channel (in the following order of preference): Unimarket Purchase OrderP-CardApproved supplier invoicing such as Consolidated Invoice ProcessingPetty cashWhile the use of the University Purchase Order (via Unimarket) is preferred; where the purchase is likely to be a single, non-recurring purchase from a supplier not already within Unimarket, then the use of the P-Card should be utilised in the first instance to avoid any unnecessary administration in processing the purchase and subsequent payment.Petty cash should only be used for low value purchases where appropriate. Petty cash limits are set by the value of the cash float for the department whose cash is being used. Refer to the petty cash procedures for further information.The University may recognise any invoices submitted for payment only where the University official purchase order number is quoted on the invoice supplied. The exceptions for this include situations where a prior arrangement has been made and agreed by the supplier and the University, and/or where a P-Card or Petty Cash has been used\n3. Purchasing options\nThere are a number of purchasing options to meet a varied range of circumstances. In order of preference these are purchasing: From the University\u2019s Internal Service Units. The University operates a wide range of professional business units (e.g. UniPrint, the University Union and Campus Temps) as well as Research Services provided by Research Infrastructure Centre ( RIC ) units.From existing University approved suppliers under contract. These contracts may be established: directly between the University and supplier;through selected contracts with syndicated procurement provisions established by other Crown entities or government departments;through wider public sector arrangements adopted by the University (e.g. All of Government contracts);from pre-qualified supplier panels established by the University or via a professional buying organisation that the University chooses to take out membership with, such as N3 purchasing agreements.through competitive market analysis and associated processes (e.g. tendering/quotes);through selective (including sole source) tender/purchase;via emergency purchase procedures as outlined in clause 8 below.Information on these purchasing options is available from the Procurement Office.\nNote: The University of Otago P-Card is effective and efficient for small value or infrequently purchased items.\nNote: In the normal course of events the University would not expect staff members to be undertaking purchases from their own funds and seeking reimbursement. In the vast majority of cases purchasing should be via a purchase order or p-Card.\n4. Restricted categories for purchase\nThe purchasing process for the sourcing of goods and/or services within the following spend categories have been restricted to the use of the approved specific University processes: IT-related hardware and associated peripheralsComputer softwareMobile phonesTravel and Travel InsuranceAirBnb bookingsPurchase of Research Equipment & ServicesAny purchase that is for Health and Safety Equipment must be secured in line with the University\u2019s Health and Safety policies.\n 5. Purchasing framework\nThe following framework provides advice on purchasing methods and options for given values of goods and services based on the total cost of ownership (including likely additional requirements after initial purchase):  Purchase Value Purchasing Method Purchasing Option\n             <$5,000 \n          Unimarket Purchase OrderP-CardApproved supplier invoicePetty CashUniversity Contracted SupplierSimple Market analysis\n             $5,000 to $100,000 \n          Unimarket Purchase OrderP-Card (up to limit defined under P-Card policy)Approved supplier invoiceUniversity Contracted SupplierMinimum of three written quotes (if possible)Formal Tender (if appropriate)\n             >$100,000 \n          Unimarket Purchase OrderUniversity Contracted SupplierMarket evaluation via formal tender processGoods or services which are available via an existing valid Standing Offer or Contract are able to be purchased in accordance with those agreements without the need for further tendering, regardless of value.Where the selection of the supplier has been made using three quotes or some other method of market analysis, evidence of this analysis should be attached to the resulting purchase order to be retained for audit purposes. Where the supplier selected did not supply the lowest quote, include a brief comment on why that particular supplier was selected such as; ability to meet required delivery timeframe, or overall value for money, etc. The selected quote should be attached to the purchase order sent to the supplier.Any purchase with a value in excess of $5,000 must be endorsed by the Financial Services Division (Finance Advisory) prior to approval by the relevant Purchase Authority (as per the Financial Delegations Policy) prior to purchase.Any purchase with a value between $75,000\u00a0and $100,000\u00a0\u00a0for which only one quote is available, or where a formal tender process is considered inappropriate, must be supported by a\u00a0Procurement Plan or\u00a0\u00a0relevant documentation which provides a justification as to the purchase method requested. This alternative purchase process must be endorsed by the Financial Services Division (Finance Advisory) and approved by the relevant purchasing authority (as per the Financial Delegations Policy) prior to purchase.Purchases greater than $100,000 will require a Procurement Plan to be completed to determine the most appropriate purchasing option unless that purchase is being transacted using an existing valid contract or via an Internal Service Unit.Purchases must not be designed, otherwise structured or divided, at any stage, in order to cause the value to fall below the thresholds listed above to avoid the requirement to competitively market test the purchase or avoid financial endorsement by Finance Advisory.High-value purchases (in excess of NZ$500,000) should be notified to the Financial Services Division\u00a0upon approval of the Purchase Order\u00a0\u00a0(email treasury.accountant@otago.ac.nz) for the purposes of cash flow planning. This advice should include the contracted payments schedule including anticipated invoice payment dates.\n6. Tendering principles\nThe University requires that all procurement of works, goods or services with a value over $100,000 (excl. GST) are subject to a competitive procurement process.Tendering processes are to be used to: establish the competitive prices and terms available;explore or test the market for alternative opportunities;fulfil a public duty of fairness and equity between suppliers;reduce the risk to reputation arising from allegations of purchaser bias or conflicts of interest;confirm current market intelligence; andidentify the best source of goods and services.The content of all tenders received by the University are confidential, and are not to be discussed, or shared under any circumstances with competing suppliers.Anyone involved in a University tender process must meet their obligations under the University\u2019s Conflicts of Interest policy.No commitment, express or implied, should be given to any supplier at any time up until the tender evaluation summary recommendation has been accepted by the relevant purchase authority.The University will use tender processes that allow for transparency of decision-making and subsequent review of the process of decision-making.All University tenders should be coordinated through the University Procurement Office to, at a minimum, obtain a tender number and for publication on the Government Electronic Tender Service (GETS) where necessary. Departments are encouraged to contact the procurement office as soon as practical after identifying that a procurement process is required.Find further information on the University Tender Process\n7. Tendering methods\nOpen tenders should be advertised in a manner so as to attract a wide response. At a minimum, such tenders should be listed via the Government Electronic Tendering Service website.Selective (including sole source) purchase or tender of any goods and services may be appropriate where: It is an emergency purchase (see section 9 below);The goods or services require specialised skills or are very complex, and there are limited qualified suppliers;The required goods and services are only available from one source, or limited sources, in the relevant timeframe;The standardisation or compatibility requirements require the use of a specific supplier;The goods or services are substantively identical to those purchased within the last twelve months under an open tender process; careful consideration should be given to changes in market conditions and the entitlement of other tenderers to compete on more favourable terms; and,Purchasing Officers should ensure that the element of competition is maintained by requesting that the selected tenderer submit a firm quotation on each occasion this dispensation is used with no indication that the selected tenderer is the only bidder.The goods or services are subject to prototype or development work. In this case, the following factors should be considered when selecting the vendor and negotiating any subsequent contract: the technical and commercial experience of the prospective vendor;the ownership of the finished product, protection of intellectual property, possible patent rights and ownership of any moulds and dies;the basis of payment including method of calculating charges, progress payments and final payments;ownership of pre-production samples; and,rights to commercial development of the product.The cost of a procurement process is likely to be disproportionate to the value or benefits likely to be gained; orThe goods or services can be obtained via a syndicated procurement or contract privity opportunity clause that provides a commercial benefit to the University and avoids any further cost of procurement.Each decision to purchase via selective tender for goods/services in excess of $100,000 must be supported by an approved procurement plan. The decision to proceed with selective tendering rests with the Delegated Purchase Authority. This documentation should be attached to the Unimarket requisition for future reference and audit purposes. A selective tender cannot be used to: Avoid competition;Protect domestic suppliers;Discriminate against any domestic or international supplier.\n8. Establishment of contracts\nThe establishment of standing offers and contracts (either established by the University or as part of a syndicated procurement opportunity) should be the result of a formal tender process (either an open tender or a selective/sole source tender).Contracts are to be executed in the name of the University of Otago and where possible, the University Contracts Templates should be used in the first instance. All standing offer contracts or agreements are undertaken on behalf of the University and will be available for use by any University of Otago department.The financial delegation\u2019s policy and procedures along with the delegations schedule classifies the categories of contracts and who has delegated authority to approve them. Contracts can only be approved by officers authorised to do by the Financial Delegations Procedure.All contracts must be registered within the respective Department\u2019s legal library within OurDrive. Contracts executed for the purchase of goods and services must be advised to the University Procurement Office who will allocate a contract number, where none exists, and, if required, provide advice to users on how to record the contract in the Ourdrive Contract Register Tool for contract recording and administration purposes.\n9. Emergency purchases\nIn case of an emergency, normal purchasing rules may be set aside for specific goods and services where: the goods and/or services are required to complete or continue significant tasksit is impossible to purchase goods and services under normal purchasing procedures.Emergency purchasing is to be used solely to meet immediate emergency\u00a0or genuine unforseen\u00a0\u00a0requirements,\u00a0\u00a0and must never be used solely for expediency. Authorising officers are to ensure that emergency purchases are strictly controlled.Approval of Emergency Purchases is to be made in accordance with the University\u2019s Financial Delegations Policy/Procedures. Where the value of an emergency purchase is in excess of $75,000, the respective Pro Vice Chancellor ( PVC ) or Service Division Head must approve that the purchase meets the Emergency Purchase threshold prior to committing expenditure.\n10. Overseas purchases\nPurchases are normally only to be made from overseas when price (including delivery and associated costs) and quality are competitive and goods are unavailable in New Zealand,\u00a0which is aligned with the New Zealand Governments\u2019 broader outcomes.For purchases requiring foreign currency, please refer to the Treasury Management Policy for notification procedures and arrangements for forward cover.\n11. Probity/conflicts of interest\nAnyone involved in a University purchase process must meet their obligations under the University\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Policy. A conflict of interest can be: Actual: where the conflict already existsPotential: where the conflict is about to happen, or could happenPerceived: where other people might reasonably think that a person has been compromised.University staff and contractors must comply with the following principles of probity (ethical conduct) throughout all stages of the procurement and contracting process: use of a competitive process where possible;transparency;identification and resolution of conflicts of interest;fairness and impartiality;security and confidentiality.All conflicts of interest shall be managed in line with the University\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Policy and recorded in the University Conflicts of Interest Register.\n12. Use of third party (agents or brokers)\nThere is no restriction on the use of agents or brokers. When considering their use, issues associated with total costs of ownership, effectiveness and efficiency, and leverage should be analysed so that the value added by agents or brokers is clearly articulated and understood. The use of an agent or broker does not negate the need for compliance\u00a0\u00a0with the University Procurement Policy and/or procedures; both in terms of how the Agent or Broker was initially selected and their subsequent purchasing activity on behalf of the University.\n13. Trade ins, free goods and trial items\nAs part of the negotiations for a purchase of replacement goods or equipment an existing item of equipment may be offered as a trade-in.A trade-in is considered to be an asset disposal for the purposes of S282 and S283 of the Education and Training Act 2020. All disposals with a book value greater than an \u201camount determined by the Minister of Education\u201d (and advised annually by FSD to Cost Centre Heads) requires the written consent of the Secretary of Education before disposal. Any further queries on this subject area should be directed to the Financial Accountant, FSD .Trade-ins should be explicitly dealt with in the contract's terms and conditions, including the value of the trade-in credited by the seller against the value of the new equipment. Full details of the sale of the old asset and the true cost of the new asset must be obtained for updating the Asset Register.Trials, free goods and trade-ins all provide opportunities for goods and services to pass between entities or individuals without fully recording the transaction. Wherever possible a price discount should be sought in preference to a 'free' item. If the good being supplied \u2018free\u2019 is an asset, where title as passed to the University, it should be advised to the University Assets and Insurance Accountant\u00a0\u00a0for registration in the University Asset register.Any \u2018Trade in\u2019 of existing University Assets needs to be advised to FSD Assets and Insurance Accountant to ensure that the asset is correctly disposed of within the University Asset Register.Goods provided for trial, where the asset \u2018risk\u2019 passes to the University, must be notified to the University Insurance Officer so that the appropriate insurance coverage can be arranged.",

        "name": "Fixed_Assets_Procedure",
        "scope": "Organisational scope not found",
        "content": "1. Definition of a fixed asset\nA fixed asset must have a future economic value to the University, be held for more than one year, and have a reliably measured value.The University level for fixed asset capitalisation is set at $2,000. Any purchase costing less than $2,000 is considered minor equipment (dissection 3216 for sundry minor equipment and dissection 3316 for minor software). The level for computer purchases is set at $5,000. Any individual purchase costing less than $5,000 is considered minor computer equipment (dissection 3321). Items paid for by instalment or purchased in parts should be considered in total for the purposes of capitalisation.The cost of repairing or replacing computer components and peripheral devices such as keyboards and monitors is to be expensed (dissection 3321 or 3329) unless the cost exceeds $5,000 and the expenditure increases the useful life of the fixed asset to which it is related.\n2. Classes of fixed assets\nThe University classifies fixed assets into the following categories: Land (dissection 8841)Buildings (dissection 8842, WIP 8843)Computers (dissection 8848)Furniture (dissection 8851)Leasehold Improvements (dissection 8844)Library Books (dissections 8852 & 8857)Motor Vehicles (dissection 8849)Network Infrastructure (dissection 8845)Plant & Equipment (dissection 8846, WIP 8847)Software (dissection 8853, WIP 8854)Rare Books & Special Library Collections (dissection 8855)Artworks (dissection 8856) Ongoing projects should be coded to the applicable fixed asset WIP -additions dissection code.\u00a0\u00a0All amounts relating to a finished fixed asset must be journaled from the WIP dissection code to the corresponding additions dissection code before they are capitalised.More detailed classification is available when recording fixed assets on the central Asset Register.\n3. Purchase of fixed assets\na. Land and Buildings\nThe capital works budget covers land purchases, new buildings (including associated equipment and furniture requirements), building improvements and upkeep and other key IT University projects (e.g. new student management system).The Capital Development Committee is responsible for prioritising the capital works budget allocation. Further information can be obtained from the Project Management Office.\nb. Other Fixed Assets\nFixed assets other than land and buildings may be purchased in accordance with the Financial Delegations Policy.Budget allocations can be transferred from operating expenditure to capital expenditure, but not vice versa, with the authority of the appropriate Divisional Head, subject to the limits in the Schedule of Financial Delegations.Fixed asset purchases may also be funded from Special Departmental Funds, External Research Grants, Otago Research Committee Grants, Trust Funds and capital carry forward credit balances. There is likely to be some conditions attached to the use of these sources of funding and further clarification should be sought from Financial Advisory, Financial Services Division.\nc. Library Books and Periodicals\nThe Information Resources Unit of the Library is responsible for the purchase of library books, standing orders and journals.Library staff select items that support the teaching, learning and research needs of academic programmes and consult with academic departments regarding selections for these purchases.Further information can be obtained from the Associate University Librarian \u2013 Information Resources.\n4. Fixed asset recording and documentation\nFixed assets are recorded on the Asset Register maintained by the Financial Control team, Financial Services Division. This register provides physical description, location, age, depreciation rate, cost, and current book value detail for each asset.Approved purchases of fixed assets must be added to the Asset Register in Finance One on the Create Asset tab within the Finance One Asset Officer Role.\u00a0\u00a0When a purchase order for a new fixed asset is receipted by the Supply Chain, they will complete an asset chart in Finance One (See Appendix I).\u00a0\u00a0This will then be commissioned by the Financial Control team.Fixed asset details recorded include the physical description, division, cost centre, purchase account, depreciation account, value (excluding GST), useful life, location code and asset classification. Data fields are also available for other useful information including manufacturer, model, and serial number.It is recognised that not all fixed assets may be purchased via Unimarket (e.g. some may be purchased via PCards).\u00a0\u00a0Finance Advisory will review the general ledger each month and any uncommissioned transactions will be treated as follows (See Appendix I): Journal the transaction to the correct asset addition dissection codeComplete the New Assets Import Template spreadsheet:New Assets Import Template (XLS) One fixed asset is to be recorded per rowAll costs to get the fixed asset fit for use should be included in the value of the asset e.g. freight, installation, etc.The amount on the spreadsheet must match the amount in the general ledger to the centIf there are several fixed assets purchased on one invoice they must be separated into one fixed asset item per rowForward the completed New Assets Import Template spreadsheet to the Financial Control team Email fsd.assets@otago.ac.nzFurniture additions do not need to be entered into the spreadsheet as these assets are created in bulk by the Financial Control team.The Financial Control team is responsible for reconciling the Asset Register monthly and the commissioning of all fixed assets.All purchases of an asset nature under the value of $2,000 should be charged to a Minor Equipment Account (3216 for other minor equipment) in the relevant activity centre.Items purchased by the Equipment Committee will be coded against the centrally held Equipment Committee budget. However, the fixed asset is attributed to the cost centre for which the fixed asset was purchased and any depreciation on the fixed asset will be charged to that cost centre.Each fixed asset is attributed to a cost centre in the University. The budget manager responsible for the cost centre is also responsible for the physical safeguarding and control of the fixed asset. Any depreciation on the fixed asset is charged to the cost centre.When purchasing motor vehicles please refer to the University Health and Safety Vehicle and Safe Driving Policy.\n5. Depreciation\nAll fixed assets except Land and Special & Rare Library Collections have a limited useful life. The Financial Control team capitalises the fixed asset by including it on the University Balance Sheet and then reduces the value of the fixed asset by charging depreciation to the cost centre.The fixed asset is depreciated to its estimated residual value. University fixed assets are depreciated down to residual values as follows: Fixed asset type Estimated useful life Depreciation rate p.a.Notes\n           Buildings and components \n        \n           10 to 250 years \n        \n           0.4% to 10% \n        \u00a0\n           Motor Vehicles \n        \n           3 to 10 years \n        \n           10% to 33.3% \n        \n           see note 1 below \n        \n           Furniture and Fittings \n        \n           5 to 10 years \n        \n           10% to 20% \n        \u00a0\n           Plant and Equipment \n        \n           4 to 60 years \n        \n           1.7% to 25% \n        \n           see note 2 below \n        \n           Computers \n        \n           3 to 10 years \n        \n           10% to 33.3% \n        \u00a0\n           Library Collections \n        \n           5 to 10 years \n        \n           10% to 20% \n        \u00a0Depreciation is calculated monthly and charged to each cost centre in dissections 5111\u20135191.The breakdown of this monthly charge is available in Finance One.\n Note 1: All Motor Vehicles will have a \u201cSalvage Value\u201d entered on the Asset Register as the time of purchase. The Salvage Value will be set at 30 per cent of the purchase price. The vehicle will then be depreciated to this Salvage Value over a 4 year period. In the last year of depreciation the Assistant Accountant \u2013 Assets and Insurance will approach the departmental owner of the vehicle to review the current Salvage Value and the estimated period the department will retain the vehicle \u2013 after this review the Salvage Value and the Remaining Life of the vehicle will be adjusted accordingly and the vehicle depreciated to the new Salvage Value over the new estimated useful life.  Note 2: The default depreciation period for Plant and Equipment is 10 years \u2013 this will be used unless the asset chart is annotated with an item appropriate useful life. \n6. Fixed asset disposal \u2013 Statutory provisions\nEducation and Training Act 2020\nSection 282(4)(a) of the Education and Training Act 2020 states that the power to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or interests in assets shall not be exercised without the written consent of the Secretary. Subsection 5 of Section 282 modifies this by allowing an institution to: 'Sell or otherwise dispose of, or mortgage or otherwise charge, an asset or interest in an asset, where the value of the asset or interest does not exceed an amount determined by the Minister or an amount ascertained in accordance with a formula determined by the Minister'.The following fixed assets cannot be disposed of without first obtaining government approval: Any fixed asset, other than land or buildings, where the market value of the asset being disposed exceeds $50,000 should be referred to Treasury Assets and Insurance Accountant, Financial Services Division.All Land and Building fixed assets should be referred to the Manager of the Property Management Unit, Property Services.Consumer Guarantees Act 1993The Act requires goods to be of an acceptable quality and reasonably fit for any particular purpose. The University may be in breach if any defects are not specifically drawn to the consumer's attention prior to sale.Fair Trading Act 1986Prohibits any person from engaging in \"conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive\".\n7. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 General\nDisposal includes any sale, trade-in, loss, destruction, theft or write-off. The sale or gifting of a fixed asset to another University of Otago department is NOT a Disposal \u2013 see Fixed Asset Transfer procedures below.The Head of Department is responsible for the custody and maintenance of their department's fixed assets. All disposals must be made with the appropriate Senior Leadership Team member's full authority in accordance with the Financial Delegations policy.\u00a0\u00a0Refer to the\u00a0\u00a0 Schedule of Financial Delegations for details of delegation levelsA Fixed Asset Disposal Form must be completed and forwarded to the Financial Control team. Email fsd.assets@otago.ac.nzDownload the Fixed Asset Disposal Form (PDF)The University must receive the maximum value for fixed asset disposals and disposal processes should be fair. GST must be accounted for in fixed asset sales as the University is GST registered.Disposal options include trade-in, transfer to another University department, sale by auction, dismantling and public tender.\u00a0\u00a0 For further advice on the best options for a particular disposal, contact: Email procurement@otago.ac.nz\n8. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 ITS E-Waste and E-Cycle Centre\nElectronic equipment and components should be recycled; refer to ITSE-Waste and E-Cycle Centre.\n9. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Sale of surplus fixed assets to staff\nFixed Assets that are replaced by the University remain the property of the University until such time as they are sold, or disposed of if they have no realisable value.The University will not sell fixed assets to staff or others at a value that is less than can be realised by sale on the open market. If the market value of a fixed asset is not able to be easily assessed, the Chief Financial Officer must be consulted for a value to be agreed.Fixed assets with no realisable value should be disposed of in the most appropriate manner, which may include gifting to staff, but only where an appropriately experienced independent person provides written advice to the University that the fixed asset being disposed of has no realisable value.All sales or gifting of fixed assets to staff require the approval of the Chief Financial Officer. Written advice from the Chief Financial Officer will be provided to the Financial Control team, Financial Services Division attached to the fixed asset disposal form.The Chief Financial Officer shall from time-to-time publish guidance and process advice on the sale of surplus assets to staff. Guidance on sale of surplus assets to staff (PDF)\n10. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Motor vehicles\nSpecial conditions apply to the disposal of motor vehicles. All motor vehicles should be disposed of via auction at Turners. The Treasury Assets and Insurance Accountant should be notified of all intended Motor Vehicle disposals prior to their disposal. Vehicles will not be sold directly to staff, if any staff wish to purchase University vehicles, they can only do so through Turners' auction process.\n11. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Sales receipts\nProceeds from the disposal of a fixed asset must be credited to the University bank account and Cashiers advised. Refer to deposit instructions for guidance. A fixed asset disposal form must be immediately forwarded to the Financial Control team after the disposal. If there are no proceeds from the disposal a fixed asset disposal form must still be completed and forwarded immediately to the Financial Control team.If a fixed asset is traded in, the supplier's invoice must show separately the total cost of the new item and the allowance for the item traded in. A fixed asset disposal form must accompany the supplier invoice before it will be passed for payment.The Financial Control team will reconcile the sale proceeds stated on the disposal form with the department account code to ensure funds have been received and credited appropriately.\n12. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Accounting treatment\nAll proceeds from the disposal of a fixed asset should be credited to the Department's Proceeds from Sale of Asset account (dissection 5211).The 5211 account is included in the calculation of the department carry forward. Any remaining fixed asset book value on the disposal will be credited (debited) to the Departments Book Value of Assets Sold (dissection 5215). The 5215 account does not impact on the department carry forward. The net effect of the 2 entries is the gain (loss) on sale of the assets for financial reporting purposes.The loss/gain/depreciation recovered on sale will be calculated by the Financial Control team using the fixed asset disposal form.\n13. Transfer of fixed assets between Departments and/or Divisions\nIf a division or department wishes to transfer a fixed asset to another University Division or Department, a fixed asset transfer form must be completed and forwarded to the Financial Control team. Email fsd.assets@otago.ac.nzFixed Asset Transfer Form (PDF) The form must be signed by both the transferee and transferor of the fixed asset (i.e. agreement by both parties)Any deemed transfer price for the fixed asset should be processed via journal entry by the purchasing department as an internal grant.The Financial Control team will prepare the necessary entries to transfer the fixed asset between the departments concerned. The fixed asset cost and accumulated depreciation will transfer to the new cost centre when the fixed asset is transferred in Finance One.\n14. Control of fixed assets\nAn important University internal control objective is the safeguarding of fixed assets. University fixed assets are widely distributed and the responsibility for their safeguarding rests with the Head of Department.All fixed assets should be secure wherever possible. Fixed assets should only be removed from the premises with the permission of the Head of Department and a system for recording the location of such fixed assets should be in place.\n15. Fixed asset audits\nThe Asset Register is one of the key tools in ensuring fixed assets can be accounted for. An audit of the main asset register will be carried out on a regular basis to ensure that the accuracy and completeness of the register is maintained.An annual verification of high value fixed assets in selected classes will be performed.\u00a0\u00a0Items will be selected based on the original cost value. Verification should be actioned by 20 December each year and documented on the appropriate record sheet.An audit will take the form of a cyclical check to ensure that all assets per the register are still in the department, that all new assets have been correctly added to the register, and that other information included in the register is accurate.In order to achieve these checks a Financial Services Division representative will assist the department to conduct the checking on a test basis.\n16. Insurance\nThe University has an extensive insurance programme aimed at minimising the risk of significant loss to the University. The insurance policy has a high level of excess which reduces the premium costs but means that departments incur the first $1,250,000 of every claim (except for motor vehicle claims). Hence insurance does not remove the obligation to manage risk within the departments.The Marine Cargo transport policy covers goods in transit within New Zealand and Australia only. Staff taking assets to other countries, which exceed the covers available on the University Travel Insurance, must arrange additional Marine Cargo transport insurance cover.",

        "content": "Budget overview\nThe budget is prepared annually and is usually scheduled over four months, typically from July to October each year, and presented to the University Council for approval. Prior to this it is considered by the Senior Leadership Team and approved by the Finance and Budget Committee. The budget preparation is an important process. Heads of Departments and Cost Centre heads advise the Divisional head of the resources required to produce the agreed level of outputs or service. This should be done in the standard budget submission document for service divisions. Academic Department Heads should take advice from the Divisional Office.\nBudget Pack\nA Budget Pack is prepared by the Budget Accountant and distributed annually. This pack contains the budget submission template for Service Divisions.\nThe following information is included for Academic Divisions:\n\n\nEFTS by paper\nIncome summary\n\nPBRF information\nCost driver information\nFunding model by cost centre\nFunding model summary\n\nThe following charges, previously distributed in budget packs and salary templates, are loaded into the budget module in Finance One:\n\nBase salary data and salary related costs\nInsurance\nITS charges\nInternal charges (rent, energy, cleaning and car parking)\nTrust information\nDepreciation\n\nTraining\nThe Financial Services Division Training Programme includes training on the budget module which is timed to coincide with service division and academic division budget preparation.\nBudget guidelines\nGuidelines are prepared annually and are available on the introduction page in each budget pack within the budget module. The guidelines should be read prior to commencing the preparation of the budget.\nBudget advice\nAdditional advice or assistance is available from the Division's Financial Analyst.\nBudget review\nThe budget review takes place from April to June each year after enrolment and course changes are known. The Funding Model is recalculated to take into account the updated EFTS information.\nThe budget review is also used to correct any major errors and allow for any major changes in objectives and outputs. The approval process for the budget review is similar to that for that original budget.\nFunding model overview\nThe purpose of the funding model is to allocate resources to the four Academic Divisions of the University.\nThe first step is the estimation of the income, for each Division, from the Government grant and student fees based on the forecast EFTS for the budget year.\nThe next step is the calculation of deductions from the income for the following items:\n\nCapital Component \u2013 a fixed amount per EFTS and is used to partially fund capital expenditure\nInternational Student Levy \u2013 an amount deducted for each international student providing central funding\nService Divisions \u2013 deductions are made for service Division budgets\nCentral Committees and contestable funds \u2013 deductions are made for each of the contestable Committee budget and contestable funds for special purposes\nFiscal Strategy Adjustment \u2013 A deduction may be made to meet the fiscal objectives set by University Council.\n\nService Division allocations\nThe main function of the Service Divisions is to provide ancillary and support services to the Academic Divisions. Service Divisions are required to prepare zero based budgets for ongoing activity. These budgets are scrutinised by the Special Budget Committee to ensure that the ongoing budgets are reasonable for the level of service performance required.\nThe Non Academic New Initiatives fund is a contestable fund which is available for new initiatives put forward by the Service Divisions and Central Committees. The Vice-Chancellor invites bids for allocations from this fund.\nSeveral departments within the Service Divisions are required to recover costs by directly charging for the services provided. These units are described as \"Business Units\" and the process is called \u201cFull Cost Recovery\u201d. Business Units are required to budget for break-even (income less expenditure equals zero). Expenditure includes depreciation but excludes capital expenditure. The Business Units include Property Management Unit, Information Technology Services, and Uniprint.\nCentral Committees and contestable funds\nThe Central Committees funded through the Funding Model are the Research Committee, Internationalisation Committee, Committee for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching (CALT), Risk Management Committee, Animal Welfare Committee and the Scholarships Committee. These Committees submit budget submissions based on forecasted need. A funding allocation is made after considering the strategic importance of outputs. The Research Committee allocates budgets to staff members for research projects based on the merit of proposals and to further the objectives set out in the University Research Plan.\nThe Internationalisation Committee promotes the achievement of the goals and objectives of the Internationalisation Management Plan and provides international scholarships and financial support for student exchange.\nThe Scholarships Committee provides funding for many of the University's awards and scholarships to promote excellence.\nThe Committee for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching promotes excellence in teaching, learning and assessment. The Committee supports innovative developments, internationalisation of programmes and curricula, and fosters and facilitates research into teaching.\nSeveral contestable funds also exist to allocate funds for proposals that help achieve the University's objectives and outputs and where funding is not available elsewhere. The current funds are the Academic Development Fund supporting new academic initiatives and the Teaching Development Fund encouraging the development of new teaching methods. Interested Departments or staff members should contact the Divisional office in the first instance.",

        "content": "1. General principles\nSpecial Consideration is intended to ensure students who have significant and unexpected impairment are not unduly disadvantaged in assessment activities.The aim of Special Consideration is to reduce the impact of impairment on assessment as practicable; a complete reduction of the impact of impairment is not guaranteed.Special Consideration shall not be used to unfairly advantage students who are impaired in assessment, i.e. through the provision of academic outcomes which the student would have been unlikely to achieve if they had not been impaired.Special Consideration is appropriate for some kinds of unexpected impairment in relation to assessment, but in certain circumstances other University provisions may be more appropriate: General study support for students with impairments through Disability Information and Support Alternative arrangements for assessment in cases of ongoing and known impairment affecting assessment (note that this normally prevents approval of Special Consideration on the basis of the same impairment)Withdrawal under exceptional circumstances, where significant and unexpected impairment prevents completion of a paper or papers (note that this cannot normally be applied for if Special Consideration in final examinations has been approved for the paper in question).For further advice on the best option for their circumstances, students are advised to contact AskOtago or Disability Information and Support.AskOtago general enquiry formDisability Information and SupportApplications for Special Consideration shall not be considered if received after the results for the relevant assessment have been made available to students.Special Consideration provisions are not available for Special Examinations.Personal information provided by students in support of Special Consideration applications will be treated in confidence and with care, in accordance with the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement.\n2. Applications for Special Consideration\nStudents seeking Special Consideration in final examinations should apply via their eVision portal unless the application relates to a Specified Health Sciences Programme, in which case alternative application provisions may be in place.\u00a0\u00a0Applications must be made no later than five calendar days after the last final examination for which Special Consideration is being sought.Applications for Special Consideration in final examinations should include relevant evidence of impairment: in cases based on medical impairment (i.e. illness or injury), a University-prescribed Health Declaration, including an assessment by a health professional, is requiredin cases based on non-medical impairment (e.g. bereavement, property damage, interpersonal issues) such other documentation as may verify the applicant's circumstances is requiredin all cases, a University-prescribed statement confirming impairment, completed by a person other than the applicant, is recommended.The University reserves the right to require that an applicant provide a statement confirming impairment and/or such additional documentation as may be needed to assess or confirm impairment.Students seeking Special Consideration in internal assessment should apply in writing to the Head of Department concerned (or nominee).\u00a0\u00a0Applications should make clear the paper(s) and assessment activities to which the application applies and, if appropriate, a requested outcome (e.g. an extension for an assignment).\u00a0\u00a0Application should be made in a timely fashion (the meaning of which may vary based on the assessment activity in question and the nature of the student's impairment).For Special Consideration in internal assessment students should provide a medical certificate or such other supporting evidence as is appropriate to verify their circumstances. Note that departments may waive the requirement for documented supporting evidence in relation to less significant internal assessment (normally assessments worth less than 10 per cent of the overall mark) and/or requests for small extensions on due dates for assessments (normally less than 5 days).In exceptional circumstances, a health professional may make a recommendation that a student not sit an examination or test, where sitting such an examination or test may be seriously detrimental to the health of the student or to others.\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances it is the student's responsibility to provide evidence of this recommendation as part of his or her application for Special Consideration, except where the recommendation is made by Student Health in relation to a final examination.\n3. Assessment of Special Consideration in final examinations (excluding Specified Health Sciences Programmes)\nThe Examinations Office shall assess Special Consideration applications in relation to each examination for which the student claims impairment, taking account of: the extent to which the evidence provided supports the student's claim of impairmentthe length of the relevant impairment and its proximity to the examination, andthe severity of the relevant impairment.For Special Consideration to be possible, the relevant impairment must be unexpected (see definitions above) and some part of the impairment must occur within the 14 days prior to, and/or on the day of, the examination.For each examination for which Special Consideration is applied for Student Administration shall determine either: that Special Consideration be granted, with an assessment of High Impairment, orthat Special Consideration be granted, with an assessment of Medium Impairment, orthat the level of impairment, or the evidence of impairment, is insufficient for Special Consideration to be granted. Any paper for which Student Administration grants Special Consideration will be marked \u201c SC \u201d on the student's academic transcript, except when there is no change in the academic outcome under clause 4 below.Where Special Consideration is granted, the application will be forwarded to the relevant department for determining the outcome of Special Consideration (see clause 4 below).\u00a0\u00a0Full details of impairment will not be provided, but the assessment of High Impairment or Medium Impairment will be made known to the department.Where a student has a history of seeking Special Consideration for similar circumstances across multiple examination periods, the Student Administration may: decline Special Consideration on the grounds that the impairment in question is not unexpected, and/oradvise the student that Special Consideration will not be subsequently granted on the basis of the same impairment.The Examinations Office shall maintain internal guidelines to ensure consistency in assessing Special Consideration applications.\n4. Academic outcomes of Special Consideration in final examinations\nTo assist in determining an appropriate academic outcome, internal assessment and other results may be used to calculate a student's expected (i.e. unimpaired) performance in an examination versus the student's actual (i.e. impaired) performance, noting that: significant differences in class mark distributions and averages between internal assessment and the final examination in the paper concerned should be taken into account (e.g. through weighting marks to reflect these differences)for students with High Impairment, internal assessment marks in the relevant paper should be used for calculating expected performance, but only where at least 20 per cent of the final mark is based on internal assessment and where the department considers internal assessment a reasonable guide to expected performance in the examination (otherwise an expected mark should not be calculated in High Impairment cases)for students with Medium Impairment, final results in other papers (preferably at similar levels and/or in similar subject areas) may also be used as a guide to expected performance where internal assessment in the paper concerned does not provide a reasonable indication of expected performance.Where a student has Medium Impairment a department may choose from the following standard academic outcomes, or choose an Aegrotat pass as specified under clause 4(e) below: The student's performance in the relevant examination was at or above expected performance \u2013 no action.The student did not sit the scheduled examination \u2013 no action (Special Consideration will not normally be granted where a student with Medium Impairment fails to sit an examination).The student's performance in the relevant examination was below expected performance \u2013 examination mark adjustment up to 5 per cent of the total possible marks available for the final examination.The student's expected performance in the relevant examination could not be determined \u2013 examination mark adjustment up to 5 per cent of the total possible marks available for the final examination (with the addition of 3 per cent being the recommended outcome in the absence of any other relevant factors).Where a student has High Impairment a department may choose from the following standard academic outcomes or the other outcomes available under clauses 4(d) and (e) below: The student's performance in the relevant examination was at or above expected performance \u2013 no action.The student did not sit the scheduled examination \u2013 Special Examination.The student's performance in the relevant examination was below expected performance but expected performance can be approximated with a limited mark adjustment \u2013 examination mark adjustment up to 10 per cent of the total possible marks available for the final examination.The student's performance in the scheduled examination was below expected performance and expected performance cannot be approximated with a limited mark adjustment \u2013 Special Examination.The student's expected performance in the relevant examination could not be determined \u2013 Special Examination.Notwithstanding the standard outcomes for High Impairment in clause 4(c): a department may recommend no action instead of a Special Examination where a student with High Impairment has very poor performance in significant internal assessment (a mark of less than 30 per cent in internal assessment where internal assessment for the paper is worth at least 30 per cent of the final result)a department may recommend a Special Examination in any case of High Impairment where it is felt that this is justified and will not unfairly advantage the student.An Aegrotat pass may be appropriate where a student has demonstrated competence in the paper concerned (normally through achieving a minimum C+ standard in significant internal assessment) and is close to, but not entitled to, a passing mark via a mark adjustment, and/oris entitled to, but is unlikely to be able to sit, a Special Examination, due to ongoing impairment or relevant timing factors (e.g. an Aegrotat pass may be appropriate to allow timely graduation).Aegrotat passes are not available as Special Consideration outcomes for students in Specified Health Sciences Programmes.Where possible and appropriate, a department may offer a student the choice between: an adjusted examination mark or a Special Examination, oran Aegrotat pass or a Special Examination. Departments are encouraged to consider these options where delays in sitting Special Examinations may potentially disadvantage students, particularly in terms of the provision of a timely finalised result for a paper, or where it is possible a student may prefer another justifiable outcome to a Special Examination.\u00a0\u00a0Where an Aegrotat pass is offered as an option, students should be made aware of the potential implications of this (see further information on the Examinations webpages).All mark adjustments should be applied to the final examination result rather than directly to the overall result for the paper.\u00a0\u00a0Mark adjustments should be used to approximate but not exceed expected performance (where expected performance can be determined).Where plussage is used, any mark adjustment on the basis of Special Consideration should be applied to the final examination result before a plussage decision is considered.When a student sits a Special Examination, the better of the two results from the original examination and the Special Examination shall count as the final result.\n5. Review process for Special Consideration in final examinations\nA student who is dissatisfied that Special Consideration in a final examination or examinations (excluding examinations in Specified Health Sciences Programmes) has not been granted may request that the decision be reviewed.To request a review, the student must write to the Director of Student Experience within five days of the initial decision to decline Special Consideration, detailing the grounds for requesting review, and including any additional documentation as appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0There is no formal provision for a student to present his or her case in person.On reviewing a Special Consideration decision the Director of Student Experience (or their nominee) shall consider whatever evidence he or she deems relevant, which will include: consideration of the review request letter from the studentconsideration of all documentation provided by the student and may include:consideration of the academic record of the student (if needing to determine whether marks appear consistent with claimed impairment when compared with unimpaired results)consultation with the student's Health Professionalconsultation with any parties providing statements in support of the student's caseconsultation with the student's academic department, and/orconsideration of such other evidence as may assist in making a fair and informed decision.As a result of review, the Director of Student Experience (or their nominee)\u00a0\u00a0may: uphold the initial decision not to grant Special Considerationoverturn the initial decision not to grant Special Consideration and grant Special Consideration with High Impairment, oroverturn the initial decision not to grant Special Consideration and grant Special Consideration with Medium Impairment.If, on assessing the academic outcome for a student with Medium Impairment, a department finds that the student's examination performance is well below expected performance (normally at least 15 percentage points lower than equivalent internal assessment marks), the department may request that the Director of Student Experience (or their nominee) reconsider the level of impairment; this may or may not result in the level of impairment being adjusted.\n6. Special Consideration in final examinations for Specified Health Sciences Programmes\nFor final examinations in Specified Health Sciences Programmes the appropriate department, school or faculty office shall make an assessment as to whether the student's impairment justifies Special Consideration, and if so, the academic outcome as a result of this.In so far as is practicable, assessment of Special Consideration in Specified Health Sciences Programmes should be carried out by the relevant department, school or faculty office in accordance with the Examination Office guidelines established under clause 3(f), and with the recommendations for academic outcomes in clause 4.Notwithstanding 6(b) above, where programme regulations for Specified Health Sciences Programmes detail Special Consideration processes which differ from those in these Procedures, the programme regulations shall take precedence.\n7. Special Consideration in internal assessment\nThe provision of any Special Consideration in relation to internal assessment is at the discretion of the Head of Department (or nominee) and should take account of: any relevant paper or programme regulationsfairness to the student concernedfairness to other students in the classthe significance of the assessment in question, in terms of its contribution to the final mark and resultpracticalities of providing Special Consideration, andthe requirement that students demonstrate competency to pass the paper.Special Consideration in internal assessment should normally only be granted where impairment is significant (i.e. is likely to have a demonstrable and significant effect on performance).Special Consideration should not be granted in internal assessment where a student has been granted Alternative Arrangements in relation to the same assessment on the basis of the same impairment.For assessments due in on a given date (e.g. essays, assignments, lab reports), the recommended action where Special Consideration is granted is an extension to the due date for submission.\u00a0\u00a0Extensions of five days or more should normally be accompanied by appropriate independent evidence (see clause 2(d)).For tests and other in-class assessments, the recommended options where Special Consideration is granted are: the rescheduling of an in-class assessment (e.g. a student presentation)the setting of an alternative and equivalent test or assessment activity for the student in questiona calculated score based on the student's marks from other assessments in the paper, which may include future assessments and the final examination, and which may be weighted based on class performance (i.e. the score may be increased if the class tended to grade higher on the assessment in question or vice versa)additional marks to a maximum of 10 per cent of the total possible marks available for the test or in class assessment based on the student's impairmentno change, where a test is worth less than 5 per cent of the final mark in the paper.The recommendations in clauses 7(d) or (e) do not prevent a Head of Department (or nominee) from taking alternative actions where they believe that such actions are consistent with the principles in clause 7(a).Terms and/or attendance requirements may be varied where Special Consideration is granted, so long as the academic integrity of the paper can be maintained.Care should be taken where a student requests Special Consideration for multiple assessments in a paper, that this will not prevent the student from demonstrating competence in the paper.\u00a0\u00a0If sufficient assessment cannot be completed, the student should be advised to consider applying for withdrawal under exceptional circumstances (see clause 1(d) above).",

        "scope": "This procedure applies to all Doctor of Philosophy and Doctoral of Musical Arts degrees. The Doctor of Business Administration examination normally includes an oral examination and the Doctor of Education may include an oral examination; this procedure applies when an oral is required as part of the doctoral examination process.",
        "content": "1.Induction into convening\nConveners are normally more senior academic staff and must have some experience examining Doctoral theses. Conveners are nominated by the Head of the supervising department, and approval is given by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Dean of the Graduate Research School.The Convener must complete a brief (5 minutes) training session on eVision processes for convening via Blackboard in order to gain access to examination management in eVision. Before convening their first examination, conveners are strongly recommended to attend a workshop for Conveners of Doctoral examinations provided by the Graduate Research School.New conveners are added into the convener database (linked below) and are sent a resource pack with detailed information about the convening process, including template emails for liaising with examiners.List of PhD Convenors of examiners (PDF)\n2.Nomination and approval to convene a Doctoral examination\nA Convener should be approached informally by the primary supervisor or Head of the supervising department, to determine their availability and willingness to act as a convener for a specific examination.Having confirmed availability, convener details are entered by the Administrator of the supervising department into the 'Nomination of Examiner' form in eVision. Following approval, once the examination begins, conveners are advised by an alert from eVision that provides details of the candidate and examiners, as well as links to key examination policies. They are asked to confirm that there is no conflict of interest in convening the examination, and acknowledge that any information received is given in confidence for use solely in relation to assessment of the thesis. In a separate email they are sent a link to a digital copy of the thesis, as well as word documents of the Oral Examination Briefing Report and Convener Recommendation Form.The Convener should find out from the supervising department who is providing administrative support for the examination process. Normally an Administrator from the supervising department would assist in liaising with examiners for logistical aspects of the examination, such as the timing of the oral examination.\n3. Overview of the examination process and role of the oral examination\nAn oral examination is normally held as part of the examination process for the degrees of PhD , DMA and DBA ; an EdD may include an oral. If the candidate first enrolled for their doctorate in 2013 or earlier, they may not be required to have an oral examination.The convening procedure for Doctoral examinations that have an oral includes five steps: initial organisation of oral examinationreceiving supervisor and examiner reports and finalising details for the oral examinationholding the oral examination and facilitating a consensus resultnotifying the resultapproving required corrections or amendmentsThe main objectives of the oral examination are to: celebrate the work of the candidate from a position of appreciative inquiryprovide the candidate with a special opportunity to discuss their work in depth and defend their thesis;establish that the candidate fully understands the work and its wider implications;provide the candidate with an opportunity to reply to criticism or challenge;enable the examiners to clarify issues in the thesis which may be unclear;allow for discussion of publication opportunities arising from the research;help the examiners to decide on the nature and extent of any corrections or revisions which may be required;provide the examiners with an opportunity to clearly communicate required corrections or revisions to the candidate; and,allow the examiners to reach agreement on an examination result, including confirming whether the thesis should be recommended as an 'exceptional thesis'.The oral examination should normally include assessment of the candidate's ability to: display detailed knowledge of the thesis;locate their research in the broader context of their discipline;demonstrate the originality of the thesis and the contribution it makes to knowledge;defend the methodology and conclusions of the thesis;display awareness of the limitations of the thesis; and,authenticate the work (i.e. prove that it is their own work).The oral examination is normally conducted in English or Te Reo. It is not the purpose of an oral examination to test the candidate's command of spoken English or Te Reo; this is particularly important for candidates whose first language is not English or Te Reo and for some candidates with disabilities.\n4. Initial organisation of the oral examination\nThe Convener, with the administrative support of the candidate's supervising department, should make arrangements for the oral examination.The date for the oral should be set once the examination has started, and pencilled in for about 12 weeks later.The oral examination is attended by: the Convener (in the Chair);the candidate; and,at least two of the examiners (typically the Internal Examiner and the New Zealand External Examiner); at the discretion of the Convener, the third examiner may also attend. If the examiners are in disagreement as to whether the candidate should pass, all three examiners must be invited to attend the oral examination.Following consultation with the candidate, the Convener may also elect to invite to the oral examination: the candidate's supervisors (to whom the Convener may address questions during the oral examination);the candidate's Head of Department or senior academic with relevant expertise (to whom the Convener may address questions during the oral examination); and,other parties as deemed appropriate, for example a support person for the candidate (such parties will not usually contribute to any discussions, but see 6(g)).The oral examination will normally be held on a University of Otago campus, and participants can either attend in person, or join by an audio or video conference link. If the candidate is joining by an audio or video link, this should occur from a site with reliable connectivity and privacy.The format of the oral examination will normally include: a brief presentation by the candidate (no more than 10-15 minutes);questions from the examiners on substantive issues communicated to the candidate in advance;other questions;free discussion; and,opportunity for questions or comments by the candidate.\n5. Receiving supervisors' and examiners' reports and finalising details for the oral examination\nAdministrators in Student Experience receive supervisors' and examiners' reports directly, and will upload and enter the results in eVision. The Convener will receive a notification via eVision as each report is entered.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener receives reports directly from the supervisors or examiners, these should be emailed to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing.\u00a0\u00a0Administrators and/or the Dean of the Graduate Research School will follow up on any late reports, but may enlist the assistance of the Convener.The supervisors' report is for the Convener's information in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0It should not be circulated before the examiners' reports have been received. In the interests of facilitating an examination result, and providing the supervisors' report contains relevant context, the Convener may wish to make this report available to the examiners after all three examiners' reports have been submitted. The candidate does not normally receive a copy of the supervisor's report at any stage in the examination process.The examiners should report independently on the thesis; the content of the independent reports should not be shared amongst the examiners until all three reports are received.\u00a0\u00a0 Occasionally a substandard report (in terms of length, tone or language) may be received.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener is concerned about the quality of the report, they should confer with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who may request a revised report from the examiner.The oral examination must not normally be held until two weeks after all the examiners' written reports on the thesis have been submitted and circulated to the candidate. If getting close to the date for the oral examination and all the examiner reports have not been received, the Convener should contact dean.grs@otago.ac.nz for assistance in getting any remaining reports submitted.Prior to the oral examination, the Convener should circulate copies of the examiner reports to each examiner to assist the examiners in determining a preliminary consensus view and agreement over the main issues to be discussed in the oral examination. Liaison with examiners could occur by email, audio visual conference, or in a pre-meeting immediately prior to the start of the oral examination. If the initial recommendation of the examiners prior to an oral examination is that the thesis be revised and resubmitted for examination, an oral examination is normally deferred until the re-examination.Regardless of whether all examiners attend, the Convener should ensure the range of views on the adequacy of the thesis are represented at the oral examination.Once arrangements are finalised, the Convener should complete the Oral Examination Briefing Report. The Convener should identify by name all those who will be present in the oral examination (i.e. the names of the examiners who will be present can be disclosed at this point). The Convener should email: the Oral Examination Briefing Report, to phd@otago.ac.nz; and,the Oral Examination Briefing Report and copies of the examiners' reports to the candidate, the supervisors, and the examiners, at least two weeks prior to the oral examination.\n6. Holding the oral examination and facilitating a consensus result\nThe Convener chairs the oral examination, which typically takes between one and three hours.Prior to the start of the examination (either by email or by a pre-meeting), the Convener should ensure the format of the examination is discussed with the examiners, and decide who will ask questions of any absent examiner.The Convener welcomes all participants and ensures introductions are made.The candidate provides a brief (no more than 10-15 minutes) presentation and may use this opportunity to address examiner concerns.The Convener oversees questioning by the examiners, trying to ensure no one dominates the questioning.Once questioning is complete, the Convener may ask the candidate if they have any questions for the examiners or any comments to make.The Convener asks the candidate, supervisors and any support people for the candidate to leave the room. On occasion, the Convener may ask the supervisors to remain behind to respond to questions the examiners may have.The Convener facilitates a consensus among the examiners on the result of the examination and any required amendments.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the Convener may need to take on an adjudicating role in order to assist this process, for example through assessing the evidence being presented by examiners' for their positions, but at no time should the Convener become involved in judging the quality of the thesis itself (this is the role of the examiners).Possible outcomes from the examination are recommendations that the thesis: be accepted as is;be accepted with minor editorial corrections, and the degree be awarded;be accepted and the degree be awarded after amendments have been made to the satisfaction of the Convener of examiners in consultation with the internal examiner;be revised and resubmitted for examination;be rejected and referred to the appropriate authority within the University for consideration of the award of another degree; or,be rejected with no right of resubmission.A decision should also be made on whether the examiners recommend the thesis be nominated for 'exceptional' status (in the top 10 per cent of theses examined).\u00a0\u00a0Such a recommendation requires that all three examiners agree that the thesis is of exceptional quality, which may be demonstrated through initial examiner recommendations or through written examiner statements confirming this recommendation following discussion and/or an oral examination. The Convener needs to provide commentary to back up the recommendation. The Convener must not disclose the recommendation to the candidate or supervisors, as the final decision to grant exceptional status resides with the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor.Following the deliberations of the Convener and examiners, the Convener invites the candidate, supervisors and support people back into the room. The Convener then verbally communicates the recommended result and may briefly outline any required corrections or revisions, noting that further details will be provided in a letter for the candidate. This is not an opportunity for the candidate to challenge the result, although they may seek clarification on the nature of required amendments to the thesis.If a consensus on a result cannot be reached, the Convener should contact the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who will advise on next steps, for example the appointment of a referee.Once consensus is reached, the Convener should draft a letter for the candidate, containing the result and required amendments (this may refer to particular (or all) examiner reports), and circulate this around the examiners for final confirmation.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notifying the result\nAs noted in 6(k) above, the Convener may relay the recommended result to the candidate at the conclusion of the oral examination.The Convener should email the recommendation for the result on the prescribed form, along with a letter to the candidate (see 6(m) above), to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing. The Administrators at Student Experience will send this letter to the candidate with copies to the primary supervisor.For an 'Accept' result (see 6(h)i, ii and iii) the Administrators at Student Experience will formally advise the candidate of the result via an alert from eVision; the Convener's letter and the examiners' reports will be sent to the candidate and copied to the primary supervisor. The Convener may also inform the candidate of the result prior to formal notification being sent.For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 6(h)iv) the Dean of the Graduate Research School will normally liaise with the candidate's primary supervisor. The Convener's letter and anonymised copies of examiners' reports will be emailed to the primary supervisor to share with the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, and the Head of Department. This process is intended to provide additional support to the candidate.For a 'Reject' result (see 6(h) v and vi) the Dean of the Graduate Research School shall manage communications to the candidate. The result letter, the Convener's letter and copies of examiners' reports will be provided to the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, the Primary Supervisor and the Head of Department. The candidate will also be advised of the process to seek leave to appeal.Where the result includes amendments or revisions, the Convener should be available to the candidate to provide clarification on the nature and scope of additional work required.A candidate has the right to seek leave to appeal if they believe there has been an unfair examination process.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approving required corrections or amendments\nFor an 'Accept' result (see 6(h)ii and iii), the Convener is responsible for ensuring that any required corrections or amendments have been completed. For this result the candidate should submit the corrected thesis directly to the Convener. The Convener should confirm with the candidate the format in which they would prefer the amended thesis (electronic, hard copy or both).For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 6(h)iv) the thesis will be fully re-examined, preferably with the same examiners and Convener; in this case the candidate will work on revisions under the guidance of their supervisor(s) and the candidate should submit their revised thesis and a separate summary of changes made to phd@otago.ac.nz; the Convener will not be required until the thesis is resubmitted.Where minor corrections are required (see 6(h)ii), the Convener is solely responsible for checking that these have been made.Where amendments are required (see 6(h)iii), the Convener is responsible for checking that these have been made in consultation with the internal examiner. Note that the internal examiner is expected to check that the amendments agreed to by the examination panel are addressed; any specific concerns of the internal examiner should not be given undue weight in this process.Once any corrections or amendments required by the examiners have been completed and the Convener is happy that all amendments have been made, an email should be sent to phd@otago.ac.nz with the following text and the Administrators at Student Experience will enter the result and upload the email to eVision. Please ensure that it is a separate email and not a reply, as the document will be uploaded to eVision as a permanent record: \u201cAll amendments have been satisfactorily completed by NAME (ID) and my recommendation is that the degree can now be awarded.\u201d The Convener may also inform the candidate of the result prior to formal notification being sent.",

        "content": "1. Introduction\nDeclaring access to public records over 25 years of age as either open or restricted is a compliance requirement under section 43 of the Public Records Act 2005.Many of the records covered by the restrictions outlined below ought to have been destroyed, under the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA*), before the restriction period ceases. For example, student health patient files should be destroyed 10 years after the most recent date on the file (if the record has not been discharged to another healthcare provider in that time), but the access restriction on this type of record is recommended for 100 years to protect an individual\u2019s personal privacy.The restrictions, therefore, are designed to provide the University with a level of control over the release of sensitive information that has been retained in excess of the recommended retention period outlined in the GDA.\n*Note that some DA numbers include GDA6 classes which have been incorporated into the Universities DA.\n2. Access Restrictions\nAll Records are regarded as open, except for the following types of records: R100 Records containing personal information of a highly sensitive nature, such as health information, welfare information or criminal information are restricted for 100 years from date of closure to protect individuals\u2019 personal privacy.Reports detailing serious internal instances of fraud, theft, misappropriations or negligence within the University (DA GDA6/7.1; 6/7.1.4).Records covering the vetting of university employees with regard to security clearances, criminal convictions and criminal history (DA 7.11).Student health patient and counselling files, including appointment registers and prescription and drug management (DA 16.9;

records relating to disciplinary processes involving individual students; and student academic transcripts (DA 15.4; 15.5; 15.18).Records relating to the administration, application and selection of childcare services (DA 16.4; 16.5; 16.6).R30 Records relating to sensitive University facilities, plant and equipment, such as hazardous material location and disposal information, and secure facilities location and access information is restricted for 30 years from date of closure to protect University staff, student and plant security.Records containing sensitive information supplied by students, staff, external agencies, or gathered with an explicit or implicit undertaking of confidence, such as survey forms, ethics discussion and approval documentation, and submissions are restricted for 30 years from date of closure to protect staff and students\u2019 security and maintain existing or assumed confidentiality agreements.Records outlining minor complaints against the University by students, employees or contractors, excluding those records officially registered as an incident or placed on an employee\u2019s file (see R70 above DA 7.6; 7.8; GDA6/3.1.1; GDA6/3.1.3; 3.6; 3.7).Records relating to information requests and complaints to the University under the Privacy Act 2020 (DA 3.15; 3.16).Records relating to the ethical approval process in relation to such areas as human and animal ethics, biosafety and radiation safety (DA 12.5).Records relating to the administration and management of animal research and body bequests and radiation and radioactive materials (DA 12.8;

Access to University Holdings\nOnce a Record has reached 25 years of age, or when a record has been transferred to the University\u2019s approved archives repository, the Hocken Collections \u2013 Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena, that Record will usually become open and members of the public can inspect the Record. However, the University can impose conditions on access to a Record and this document acknowledges that, for a limited period, some types of public information created by the University should be restricted from general access.Access to any restricted public record over 25 years of age held at the University requires the permission of the Registrar and Secretary to the Council. Requests for access to restricted Records should be addressed to:The Registrar and Secretary to the Council Office of the Vice-Chancellor PO Box 56 Dunedin 9054\n4.

        "scope": "This is a University-wide procedure and guidelines, applying to all University staff or individuals including the University's Council members and students, where they are incurring costs on the University's behalf.\nSpending in research projects must comply with this procedure and guidelines and any additional more restrictive requirements contained in the funding contract, accompanying rules or legislation.\nThis procedure and guidelines should be read in conjunction with the University's Sensitive Expenditure Policy.",
        "content": " 1. Approval of sensitive expenditure\nApproval of sensitive expenditure should be given: only when the person approving the expenditure is satisfied that the principles in the Sensitive Expenditure Policy have been adequately metbefore the expenditure is incurred, wherever practicalonly when an approved budget and delegated authority existby a person senior to the person who will benefit or who might be perceived to benefit from the sensitive expenditureIn the case of the Vice-Chancellor, final approval shall be given by the Chancellor.In the case of the Chancellor, final approval shall be given by the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee.In the case of the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee, final approval shall be given by the Pro-Chancellor.In the case of all other Council members, final approval shall be given by the Chancellor.If staff are unsure about the escalation of approvals they should contact their Finance Associate.Where Sensitive Expenditure is required to be approved by Deans, Pro-Vice-Chancellors, Heads of Division or the Vice-Chancellor, the relevant form should be completed: Event approval form (PDF)Gift approval form (PDF)Donation approval form (PDF)Where Sensitive Expenditure is required to be approved by Heads of Departments or budget holders this approval can be granted in a method deemed appropriate by the authoriser.Approvals can be granted in principle or for a series of events at the discretion of the approver.\n2. Claims and supporting documentation\nClaims and supporting documentation should be of the same type and standard outlined in the Financial Delegations Policy except that greater detail should be provided where the documentation does not fully explain why the sensitive expenditure was necessary. It is a requirement for sensitive expenditure that supporting documentation is original, or scanned / photograph images of the original.\u00a0Receipts and other supporting documentation must be itemised, and clearly show GST for NZ transactions.It is expected that staff will claim their reimbursement within three months of incurring the expenditure.\n3. Use of University-owned business units\nUniversity-owned business units must be used wherever possible. This includes, but is not limited to, the University Union, Residential Colleges and UniPrint. Therefore any goods or services covered by the Sensitive Expenditure Policy will be subject to this directive.\n4. Travel and accommodation expenditure\nThe University's policy and procedures for travel and travel related expenditure can be found at: Travel and Travel Related Costs PolicyTravel Planning Procedures\n5. Entertainment and hospitality expenditure with external parties\nEntertainment and hospitality is defined as business expenditure usually for the purposes of: building relationshipsrepresentation of the organisation, orreciprocity of hospitalityThis expenditure can cover a range of expenditure from coffee with a research colleague while at a conference to a fully catered alumni event.For the purposes of this procedure and guidelines staff, students, contractors, suppliers and potential suppliers are not considered to be external parties.The principles of a justified business purpose, and moderate and conservative expenditure are particularly relevant.In most instances the guidelines pertaining to meals and alcohol should apply. In instances where the expenditure may not meet the guidelines pertaining to meals and alcohol staff should be prepared to demonstrate why the spending was appropriate.Approval must be gained from the person holding delegated authority to expend the budget being charged. If the person holding the delegated authority could be a beneficiary, or a perceived beneficiary, of the expenditure then the one-up principle for sign-off must apply. Where practical this approval should be sought before the entertainment or hospitality expenditure has been incurred.\n6. Farewell and retirement functions\nExpenditure on farewell and retirement functions for staff members will only be at the University's expense if they are formal, organised by a University department and are moderate and conservative.The time of day, size, scale and nature of the function should be commensurate with the staff member's length of service and role. It is not expected that formal farewell functions paid by the University will be held for staff with less than five years of service.The first option for a venue for farewell and retirement functions should be on campus. If the function must be held off-campus due to unavailability of a suitable on campus venue, then the choice of venue must be appropriate and moderately priced.Approval must be gained before the event from the person holding delegated authority to expend the budget being charged. This approval can be granted even when the person holding the delegated authority could be a beneficiary, or a perceived beneficiary.\n7. Staff recognition, team building, retreats, student events and Christmas functions\nFor any event under this category it should be demonstrable that the event has a justified business purpose and the expenditure is moderate and conservative.Where possible the venue for events under this category should be on campus. If the function must be held off-campus due to unavailability of a suitable on campus venue, then the choice of venue must be appropriate and moderately priced.Approval must be gained before the event from the person holding delegated authority to expend the budget being charged. If the person holding the delegated authority could be a beneficiary, or a perceived beneficiary, of the expenditure then the one-up principle for sign-off must apply. When the person holding the delegated authority or the person granting one-up approval is an invited attendee, rather than the organiser or host they can still grant approval.Low value events, such as morning teas, afternoon teas, and staff/student events can be approved by a Head of Department or Service Division provided they aren't frequent and they follow the principles set out in the Sensitive Expenditure Policy. This applies even when the Head of Department or Service Division are also in attendance at the event.Where the University is providing low value catering primarily intended for students approval should come from the Head of Department, Head of Service Division or from Directors, Head of Service or Managers within Operations, External Engagement, Research Office and Student and Academic Services. This is also the case if staff (including the authoriser) benefit from this catering where the benefit is incidental to the purpose of the catering.If meals are included in the cost of these activities, then the principles for those categories of expenditure, found elsewhere in these procedures should apply.The University has an organisation wide Graduation function and as such if departments wish to hold their own function these should be modest and reasonably priced.\n8. Meals and alcohol\nMeals must have a clear business purpose and be moderately priced. As a guide they should not exceed NZD$65 per head for dinner and NZD$45 per head for lunch. These amounts include non-alcoholic beverages. Dollar values specified are in New Zealand dollars and inclusive of GST.Where possible the venue for meals should be in University owned and catered premises.Except where the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor provides approval in advance, the University will not fund the purchase of alcohol for University events or in relation to staff travel, hosting, sustenance or entertainment.\u00a0\u00a0Staff requests, which will only be approved in exceptional circumstances, should be directed to the Vice-Chancellor.The University would not normally pay for a staff member or University representative's partner's meal unless the presence of a partner is of benefit to the University, such as for cultural reasons. Permission should be sought from the approver prior to the meal occurring.The cost of staff or University representative travel from and to home for a local University function is not a business expense so will not be paid by the University.\n9. Caf\u00e9 meetings\nCaf\u00e9 meetings between staff (or between staff and students) will not be funded by the University. If staff choose to meet in a caf\u00e9 the expense is personal, not business related.Caf\u00e9 meetings with external guests will be paid by the University where it is appropriate to do so. In such cases, it is a requirement that University-owned caf\u00e9s are used wherever possible.\n10. Recruitment dinners\nDinners with staff and prospective candidates are acceptable for the recruitment of academic or executive positions. Staff attendance should normally be limited to four with any exceptions to be prior approved by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor.Dinners with staff and prospective candidates for the recruitment of all other professional staff positions are not acceptable except in exceptional circumstances, in which case the approval of one of the Vice-Chancellor, a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, a Pro-Vice-Chancellor or the Chief Operating Officer is required.\n11. Koha and Pacific Gifting\nThe University has separate policies that cover Koha and Pacific Gifting payments: Koha Payments Policy and ProcedurePacific Gifting Policy, Procedure and Guidelines\n12. Giving gifts\nThe giving of gifts to University staff where the University makes a contribution in addition to funds raised through contributions by staff is only acceptable in the following circumstances: Farewells and retirements for staff with more than five years of service to the UniversityThe bereavement of a close family member of a staff memberOn the occasion of a staff member's serious illness or accidentThe giving of gifts to external parties or individuals where the University makes a contribution is only acceptable in the following circumstances: Recognition and thanks for unpaid work given by non-staff members for the benefit of the University.A meeting, event or ceremony where the giving or exchanging of gifts is customary, other than Koha or Pacific Gifts which is covered elsewhere in these procedures and is subject to a separate policy.Any gifts up to and including NZD$100 must be pre-approved by the head of the Division responsible for the cost.Except where the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor provides written approval in advance, the University will not fund the purchase of alcohol as a gift.Gifts for purposes not included in clause 12 (a) and (b) or for a value above NZD$100 will require the approval of the Vice-Chancellor. This function has been delegated to the Chief Financial Officer to review in the first instance.Only one gift from the University should be purchased and this should be arranged by the line manager of the individual receiving the gift.Under no circumstances can gifts given by the University be exchanged for cash by the recipient.Gifts for other events (including births, engagements, weddings, birthdays, Easter and Christmas) will not be funded by the University.\n13.Donations\nA donation is a payment (in money or by way of goods or services) made voluntarily and without expectation of receiving goods or services in return.All donations must be pre-approved by the Vice-Chancellor.\n14. Sale of surplus assets to staff\nThe University's procedures relating to sales of surplus assets to staff is contained in the Fixed Assets Procedure.\n15. Loyalty reward scheme benefits\nLoyalty reward schemes provide a benefit to the customer for continuing to use a particular supplier of goods or services. Generally, the rewards tend to be given to the named individual who orders or purchases the goods or services, regardless of who has paid for them.In such cases it is impractical to control the use of these rewards, but as far as is practicable, staff should use loyalty rewards for the benefit of the University or for business-related activity.\n16. Private use of University assets\nAny physical item owned, leased, or borrowed by the University is considered an asset for the purpose of this section. This includes photocopiers, phones, digital devices, internet access, and stationery. As a general rule, staff should not use University assets for personal reasons unless approval is obtained from the manager of the department responsible for the asset and a reasonable charge is made that recovers at least the direct costs of that usage. However, it is recognised that it is sometimes impossible to avoid a personal element of use during business use of an asset. When this occurs it should be clear that the personal use was secondary to the use for business purposes and that no additional cost was incurred by the University as a result of the personal use. It is the responsibility of the staff member to provide this evidence if requested.\n17. Clothing and grooming\nOther than uniforms and health and safety-related clothing, staff should not be clothed or groomed at the University's expense when they are engaged in a normal business activity (whether in New Zealand or overseas), except when allowed for under an employment agreement.\n18. Care of dependants\nPayments for the care of dependants, other than under employment agreements, are not permitted unless there is a clear business purpose, and prior approval is received from the Vice-Chancellor or the Director of Human Resources.\n19. Miscellaneous staff support and welfare expenditure\nThere is a wide variety of expenditure that can fall into this category of sensitive expenditure, and can include club and professional memberships, motor vehicles use, and access to papers, magazines and periodicals.The following principles shall apply to this category of expenditure: Payments and rewards in lieu of, or additional to, a staff member's usual periodic remuneration can be made where they are provided for in the staff member's employment agreement.Where a payment or reward is not provided for in a staff member's employment agreement, prior approval must be obtained from the Vice-Chancellor or the Director of Human Resources before a payment can be made or a reward provided.Both Financial Services and Human Resources must be contacted prior to seeking approval to ensure that the payment or reward is appropriate and consistent with similar circumstances and that any taxation implications are clearly understood and appropriately addressed.\n20. Compliance\nTransactions are monitored regularly by Financial Services Division and the Office of Risk, Assurance and Compliance for compliance with this policy.The Vice-Chancellor or any approver as per clauses 1(b) through to 1(f) has the authority to disallow any expenditure considered to be unreasonable.Breaches of this policy will be reported to the Vice-Chancellor and may result in disciplinary action.",

        "scope": "This procedure applies to all University-approved prizes and scholarships.",
        "content": "1. ResponsibilitiesThe Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards and the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships, within their respective areas of responsibility, are responsible for: ensuring standardisation of prize and scholarship regulations, that such regulations comply with relevant University policies and statutes; andthe ongoing administration of established scholarships and prizes including general advertising as appropriate.The Development and Alumni Relations Office, together with the Research and Enterprise Office if appropriate, is responsible for liaison with prize and scholarship donors including discussions on the establishment of a new prize or scholarship; andthe setting up of any associated trust funds and through ongoing stewardship once a prize or scholarship is established.The Development and Alumni Relations Office is also responsible for ensuring that prize and scholarship donations are consistent with the University's broader development and alumni relations strategies.The hosting department is responsible for the initial drafting of regulations for new scholarships and prizes, ensuring regulations are updated to reflect relevant changes to qualifications, papers or course structures, and specific advertising as appropriate.Other responsibilities shall be as laid down in specific prize or scholarship regulations.Establishment of a new prize or scholarshipIt is expected that University prizes or scholarships will be offered in perpetuity. Minimum values for new prizes and scholarships are stated in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below. If perpetuity or minimum value requirements are not met, a special case will need to be made for the establishment of the prize or scholarship.The procedure for establishment of a new prize or scholarship is as follows: In considering establishment of a new prize or scholarship, the hosting department should first contact the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards or, if applicable, the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships for initial advice and assistance. If an external donor is involved, the Development and Alumni Relations Office and/or the Research and Enterprise Office must also be contacted.Where departmental funds are solely intended to support a new or amended prize, the Department must demonstrate the strategic value to the University of the prize before development of regulations. Strategic value in this instance is defined as supporting equity, sustainability or other key strategic frameworks of the University.The prize or scholarship regulations must be drafted to the satisfaction of the hosting department, the Manager Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards or Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships (whichever role is applicable) and the donor.The details for the prize or scholarship must be recorded on the appropriate proposal form, available from the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards.The completed proposal form must be signed by the appropriate Head of Department, Dean, or the equivalent head of the hosting department.For scholarships or prizes associated with an Academic Division, the proposal form and associated documentation must then be submitted for endorsement by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or appropriate Divisional Board (approval practice may vary across Divisions).For University-wide scholarships or prizes, the proposal form must be endorsed by the appropriate Deputy Vice-Chancellor or the Vice-Chancellor.The completed documentation comprising a signed proposal form and final wording for the prize or scholarship regulations must be returned to the Manager Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, or the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships, if applicable, who will then arrange for final consideration and approval by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Proposals for new prizes or scholarships can be submitted at any time throughout the year.Naming of a new prize or scholarshipThe University allows prizes and scholarships to be named after sponsoring organisations and for the regulations of prizes and scholarships to acknowledge the donor, with the following provisos: The University does not accept sponsorship from companies that produce or distribute alcohol, tobacco or munitions.The University may require amendments to, or reject, a proposal for a new prize or scholarship, where the naming or acknowledgement of a sponsor is deemed to be against the values or strategic interests of the University.The University may require amendments to, or disestablish, an existing prize or scholarship, where the naming or acknowledgement of a sponsor is deemed to be against the values or strategic interests of the University.Prizes shall not be named after current members of staff or current students.Departments, Schools/Faculties and Divisions may choose to implement their own restrictions on prize naming and acknowledgement of donors within regulations, as is deemed appropriate to their discipline areas.Amendment of an existing prize or scholarshipAmendments to approved University Prizes or Scholarship regulations fall into three categories as follow:Minor editorial corrections such as formatting changes or minor wording changes that do not alter the substantive meaning of the regulations. These must be approved by the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, or for Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships by the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships.Changes to the regulations which do not alter the general intent of the prize or scholarship. If applicable, these require consultation with the donor and/or the University's Treasury Accountant for trust-funded scholarships and prizes. Changes require the endorsement of the appropriate Head of Department (or equivalent) and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or equivalent) and final approval by the Convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council. Such changes may include amendments: to prize or scholarship titlesto information relating to the circumstances of the prize or scholarship (e.g. donor information)to selection criteria which do not alter the general intent of the prize or scholarshipto application processesto selection panelsto award valuesrelating to changes to papers, course structures or qualifications referred to in the regulations.Substantive changes to the regulations which alter the general intent of the prize or scholarship. These require approval by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council. The process followed should be as detailed above under \u201cEstablishment of a New Prize or Scholarship\u201d.Disestablishment or suspension of an existing prize or scholarshipPrizes or Scholarships may be permanently disestablished or suspended due to lack of available funds or for strategic reasons.Where a prize or scholarship is funded by a trust, by an external donor, or by a department or other University unit, and temporarily there are insufficient funds to offer the award, the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards may suspend the prize or scholarship until such time as funding is again available or sufficient.Where a prize or scholarship is funded by a trust, by an external donor, or by a department or other University unit, and there are permanently insufficient funds to offer the award (either at its current value or under the guidelines laid out in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below),\u00a0the Scholarships and Prizes Committee may disestablish the prize or scholarship, through the delegated authority of Council.Requests for prizes or scholarships to be disestablished on strategic grounds should be made in writing to the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, and endorsed by the Head of the hosting department and relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or equivalent). This request shall be forwarded to the Scholarships and Prizes Committee who may disestablish the prize or scholarship, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Review of existing prizes and scholarshipsThe Scholarships and Prizes Committee shall conduct a formal review of the values of all University prizes and scholarships every four years. From this review the Committee shall:Approve increases of value in prizes and scholarships where funds permit.Approve the continuation of selected prizes and scholarships which fall below the usual minimum values outlined below, where there are strategic reasons for doing so, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Recommend to hosting departments the re-purposing of prizes and scholarships where an excess of available funds allow this (for example recommend a prize be amended to, or supplemented by, a higher-value scholarship where funding permits).Report to Senate and Council on currently suspended prizes or scholarships which have been suspended for more than one year.Approve the disestablishment of prizes and scholarships where there is insufficient continuing funding available, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Review minimum values as outlined in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below.Maintain a list of all University prizes and scholarships that is available on request to University staff and students.Prize and scholarship minimum valuesIt is expected that, notwithstanding section (f) below, all University prizes and scholarships will provide a monetary award, or an award in the form of other goods, to the recipient(s).The minimum monetary value for a new prize is normally $500.The minimum monetary value for a new scholarship is normally $3,000.The minimum monetary value for an existing prize or scholarship is normally half the minimum value for a new prize or scholarship (i.e. $250 and $1,500 respectively).Non-monetary goods awarded as prizes and scholarships (e.g. books) should have the approximate monetary values as specified above.Exceptions to minimum values for prizes and scholarships will only be approved in exceptional circumstances, and shall be considered by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council, either, for new prizes or scholarships, on the basis of a case provided by the hosting department, or for existing prizes or scholarships, following review (see Section 6 (b) above).Where, in any one year, a prize is shared across recipients, the value of the prize shall normally be split between the recipients. The amount awarded to each recipient must be no less than half the stated value of the prize. In cases where the prize is shared across more than twice the number of usual recipients, it is the responsibility of the host department to provide additional funds to meet this condition.Recording of prizes and scholarships on academic recordsThe recipient of a scholarship or prize approved by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council, will have the award notated on their academic transcript.",

All switchgear and lighting both internal and external to the space which performs an emergency function should be appropriately labelled to identify that function.Where existing fixed walk-in refrigerated spaces that are owned by the University do not meet the requirements above, these shall be upgraded through the Statutory Budget upgrade process.\u00a0\u00a0The statutory budget working group is responsible for prioritisation of any remedial work in accordance with the risk.\n3. Maintenance requirements\nThe Property Services Division is responsible for the maintenance and repair of all fixed walk-in refrigerated spaces in the University owned facilities.The maintenance interval for the inspection of any safety device shall be 3\u2011monthly.\n4. Leased facilities\nWhere the University leases facilities that include walk-in refrigerated space, the lease agreement must include provisions to ensure; That these meet the design requirements in clause 2 above or will be refurbished to meet these requirements as part of the lease agreement.That 3\u2011monthly inspections of any safety devices will occur.\n5.

        "content": "1. Introduction\nThe Education and Training Act 2020 defines the University as a body corporate (S272) with the Council as the governing authority (S271). Power is vested in the Council but may be delegated in accordance with Section 285, which states in S285(1) that: An institution's council may, from time to time, either generally or specifically, in writing signed by at least 2 members of the Council, delegate to the chief executive of the institution or to a committee appointed under section 283(4) of this Act, any of its functions or powers under this Act (except the power to appoint a chief executive) or under any other Act.The powers are extensive, although limited by Section 282(4) which states: \u2026an institution may not exercise any of the following powers without the written consent of the Secretary: the power to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or interests in assetsthe power to mortgage or otherwise charge assets or interests in assetsthe power to grant leases of land or buildings or parts of buildingsthe power to borrow, issue debentures, or otherwise raise moneyThis restriction is tempered by Section 282(5) which allows these activities to be undertaken within Minister determined levels (for a, b, and d above) or for leases, for terms of less than 15 years.The application of money is covered by Section 304 which provides: \u2026the money of an institution shall be applied only: in payment or discharge of the expenses, charges, obligations or liabilities incurred or undertaken by or on behalf of the institution; orin payment of any remuneration or allowances payable to members of the Council or of committees of the Council or to the chief executive or members of staff of the institutio; orin making any other payments that are required or permitted by this Act or any other enactment to be made out of the money of the institution\n2. Contracts\nContracts are categorised as follows:\nCategory 1: Purchase Contracts with Suppliers for Goods and/or ServicesCategory 1 contracts shall be approved and signed by the initiators, subject to the delegations and budget limits specified in the Schedule of Financial Delegations.Contracts or agreements which commit to expenditure beyond the annual budget or exceeding the available carry forwards shall be considered as Category 3 contracts.Operating Leases which continue beyond the annual budget and all Finance Leases, regardless of period, shall be considered to be Category 3 Contracts.Central recording is not required for Category 1 contracts.Category 2: Research, Commercial and Teaching Contracts to Provide Goods and/or ServicesCategory 2 contracts, regardless of value, shall be submitted by the initiator to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research & Enterprise, or their delegated authority, for final approval and signing.Category 2 contracts are required to be recorded centrally.Category 3: All Other Contracts (except Employment Contracts)Category 3 contracts, regardless of value, shall be submitted by the initiator to the Chief Operating Officer, or their delegated authority, for final approval and signing.Category 3 contracts are required to be recorded centrally.\n3. Financial Delegations explanatory notes\nStaff DelegationsPolicies and procedures for the appointment of staff are held by Human Resources Division.Capital DelegationsThese delegations apply to the purchase, sale and disposal of capital assets.The transfer, sale or disposal of assets is restricted by section 282 of the Education and Training Act 2020, which requires Ministry of Education approval before any transfer, sale or disposal can proceed.Assets, other than land or buildings, may be transferred, sold or disposed without Ministry of Education approval where the book value is less than a sum determined by formula provided by the Ministry of Education (as calculated annually and advertised by Financial Services Division). The transfer, sale or disposal of land and buildings, including the full or partial demolition of buildings, requires the approval of the Ministry of Education regardless of value.Ministry of Education approvals are required to be obtained before any transfer, sale or disposal is commenced as retrospective approval is not permitted. The Chief Financial Officer will arrange approval on request.The delegation also covers the ability to transfer funds from operating budgets to capital budgets.Cost Centre heads may delegate their authority for expenditure approval within the constraints outlined above, which are also in accordance with the University\u2019s Schedule of Financial Delegations. Cost Centre heads should also ensure that the relevant Delegated Signing Authority form has been completed and submitted as per process.Operating Expenditure DelegationsThese delegations apply to expenditure other than capital expenditure. Operational budgets are approved annually.These delegations refer to expenditure within the current approved budget. Any expenditure commitments beyond the current approved budget are excluded from this delegation. Such commitments should be treated as Category 3 contracts.The delegation for operating expenditures is subject to, and should be read in conjunction with, the delegations for staff, contract delegations and carry forward balances.Cost Centre heads and research grant holders may delegate their authority for expenditure approval within the constraints outlined above, which are also in accordance with the University\u2019s Schedule of Financial Delegations. Cost Centre heads should also ensure that the relevant Delegated Signing Authority form has been completed and submitted as per process.Carry Forward BalancesSpecified Cost Centres within the University are entitled to carry forward any variances from budget in terms of the Financial Monitoring and Control Policy.Carry forward balances are held at Activity Centre level.Delegations for the expenditure of carry forward balances are subject to the net carry forwards at each organisational level being positive.

These sections could be merged or reorganized for better consistency.\n\n4. The policy data contains multiple references to the University's Schedule of Financial Delegations across different sections. Consider creating a centralized section or document that outlines all delegations, including cross-references and relevant policies (e.g., Section 282).\n\n5. The repeated mentions of \"Cost Centre heads\" in various sections could be condensed into a single section with clear guidance on their roles and responsibilities within the delegation process.\n\n6.

        "scope": "Organisational scope not found",
        "content": "1. Introduction\nAccountability is a key feature of the financial systems. The budget is the financial plan for the year. It is essential to monitor actual progress against this plan to ensure that the desired fiscal result will be achieved. The University has a monthly reporting and monitoring programme to facilitate this. The monthly reports are the main tool of financial control enabling cost centres to monitor income and expenditure against budget. More frequent monitoring can be performed by performing enquiries within Finance One.On a corporate basis, monthly accounts are prepared which are similar in almost all respects to the annual accounts except that more detail is provided. These accounts, together with an analysis of the University's financial performance, are provided to the Vice Chancellor, Finance and Budget Committee, and the University Council by the Financial Services Division.\n2. Reporting Systems\nMonthly reports are the primary mechanism used for financial control as they enable departments to monitor their income and expenditure and budgets.Reports Available:Each month the Financial Services Division produce and distribute the financial reports.Cost Centres will typically get the following General Ledger reports each month: Activity Centre by Dissection Report. This Report shows all the income and expenditure in each Activity Centre within a Cost Centre. This is the base-level report, and one is produced for every Cost Centre.Cost Centre by RCM Summary Report. This Report shows the net results for the Cost Centre and variance analysis is prepared to explain performance against budget.Should a department require a General Ledger Transaction Listing Report, please contact Finance Advisory. The General Ledger Transaction Listing Report lists all the transactions within income and expense dissections (accounts) and includes the reference, a brief description, and the amount.Custom designed Project Ledger Reports are provided monthly to Principal Investigators.Trust Reports are held in the Trust Ledger (TL) in Finance One. All income and expenditure is held in the one account with the unspent balance being carried forward from one year to the next. These accounts are not permitted to go into a negative.Detailed financial information is also available from Finance One. Report Format:Incomeless Expensesequals Surplus (Deficit)\n3. Report Analysis\nMonthly Financial Reports are produced the 4th and 10th working days of the month and are distributed to Cost Centre managers and Principal Investigators for feedback.When the Reports arrive in the Cost Centre what should happen?After being distributed to the persons responsible, the Cost Centre head should ask for a report back from the Activity Centre as soon as possible giving a brief reason for the variance and the action, if any being taken to correct. The reporting mechanism is important because it reinforces the staff members\u2019 accountability for their budget.What to look for in Reports?All financial performance is measured against the budget (University Policy). However, the budget is a forecast of the future prepared the previous year, and it is inevitable that there will be variances on a line-by-line basis.The key result is the contribution margin result. Cost Centres should match or exceed the budgeted contribution. If a Division is not going to meet the contribution margin, this must be discussed and pre-approved by the Vice-Chancellor.Look for trends. In most cases it is easy to see if any Activity Centre is starting to trend adversely.A common reason for variance is timing differences between actual events and the budget. It is accepted that timing can be difficult to predict. However, it is recommended that departments endeavour to apply some methodology to monthly budget splits rather than adopting the practice of simply dividing the budget total by twelve.Forecasting the year end position is required and Finance Advisory staff will support Cost Centre heads in preparing this.It is strongly recommended that early help is sought if a budget problem is becoming evident. Do not ignore it and hope it will come right. The first contact should be your Finance Advisory staff, who will confirm the analysis of the problem. Should the analysis be confirmed as correct, the departmental or divisional head should be advised so that action can be taken.Errors?Where unexpected transactions appear in the reports, they should be followed up to ensure they are correct and properly authorised. Advice can be sought from the Finance Advisory team.Where errors are found, embedded Finance Advisory staff will assist with correcting journals which will include appropriate and relevant supporting documentation.\n4. Annual Reports\nThe Education and Training Act 2020 (s 305) deems all tertiary institutions to be crown entities in terms of the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA) . Section 43 of the PFA requires that crown entities prepare financial statements. The form of these statements must comply with Generally Accepting Accounting Practice  (GAAP)  which in turn is defined in the Financial Reporting Act 2013. GAAP is defined by reference to approved accounting standards with authoritative support within the New Zealand accounting profession.The University is required to prepare and submit to Parliament an audited Annual Report detailing the operations of the University during the year for each of its outputs as determined by the University Council.The Annual Report includes: Financial statements including a Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Accounting Policies.Non-financial statements (called a Statement of Service Performance) reporting on the achievement of the targets per output outlined in the Statement of Objectives approved by the University Council and presented to the Tertiary Education Commission.A report from the Vice-Chancellor.",

This would help to distinguish between policies and procedures, making it easier for users to understand their purpose.\n2. **Remove redundant content**: Identify and remove any repetitive or unnecessary information from policies, such as cross-references to other policies.\n3. **Define key terms**: Policies that deal with ambiguous concepts (e.g., \"University-related\") should provide clear definitions or criteria for determining what constitutes a University-related activity.\n4. **Use a consistent format**: Ensure that all policies follow a standard format, including headings, bullet points, and concise language.\n\nBy addressing these areas, the policy database can become more efficient, clear, and easier to navigate."

Employment relationship problems\nEmployment relationship problems include such things as personal grievances, disputes about the interpretation or application of employment agreements, or other workplace issues that may harm the employment relationship, but do not include problems with the fixing of new terms and conditions of employment.\n2. Raising the problem\nIf you think you have a problem in your employment, then you should raise it with your Manager or Academic Head as soon as possible, so the University can try and resolve it with you. If for any reason you feel unable to raise it with your Manager or Academic Head, you should approach another appropriate manager, Human Resources Adviser or the University Mediator. In some cases, there is a time limit on when you have to do this \u2013 see clause 6 \u201cPersonal grievances\u201d below.\n3. Representation\nAt any stage, you have the right to seek advice and support from your union or a representative. The University will work with you and that person to try to resolve the problem. Information may also be sought from Employment Mediation Services provided by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment at any time.\n4. Mediation services\nIf we are unable to resolve the problem, then either party can contact the University Conflict Resolution and Mediation Services or the Employment Mediation Services provided by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) for free assistance. The mediator will try to help us resolve the problem but won't make a decision as to who is right or wrong unless both parties want this.\nUniversity of Otago Conflict Resolution and Mediation Services\nMBIE Employment Mediation Services\n5. Employment Relations Authority\nIf the problem is still not resolved to your satisfaction, then you can apply to the Employment Relations Authority to have the problem investigated and a determination made. This decision can be appealed, by either party, to the Employment Court and then to the Court of Appeal.\n6. Personal grievances\nIf your employment problem is a personal grievance (i.e. unjustified dismissal, unjustifiable disadvantage, discrimination, duress, sexual or racial harassment), then you must raise it within 90 days of the problem actually occurring or coming to your attention for the first time. A personal grievance can only be raised outside of this timeframe with the agreement of the employer, or if the Employment Relations Authority deems there to be exceptional circumstances.\nYou should raise any personal grievance with your Head as above. It is preferable that you put your grievance in writing, but this is not compulsory. You may ask your union or representative to raise the grievance on your behalf.\n7. University of Otago Ethical Behaviour Policy\nCertain types of employment relationship problems may be able to be dealt with through the University of Otago Ethical Behaviour Policy, particularly problems involving harassment.\n8 Human Rights Commission procedures\nIf you believe you have a grievance based on discrimination or sexual or racial harassment, an alternative procedure is available through the Human Rights Commission. However, you cannot refer your grievance to both the Human Rights Commission as a complaint and to the Employment Relations Authority as a personal grievance. You have to choose one option or the other.",

which the academic proposal originates or which is significantly impacted by the academic proposal shall exercise their authority \u2013 as nominee of the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor \u2013 to grant executive approval to academic proposals within the scope of the expedited approval process on behalf of the relevant Divisional Academic Board, andthe Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) shall exercise their authority to grant executive approval to academic proposals within the scope of the expedited approval process on behalf of Academic Committee (AC), and on behalf of the Senate \u2013 as the nominee of the Vice-ChancellorThe establishment of the expedited approval process shall not limit the ability of Conveners of relevant committees \u2013 or their nominees \u2013 to grant executive approval to academic proposals in appropriate circumstances beyond the scope of the expedited approval process as they see fit.CriteriaThe expedited approval process may be used for academic proposals recommending changes to papers and/or programmes which do not involve any one or more of the following:the introduction of any new paper or programme,amendments to an existing paper constituting a change of 25% or more to the content of the paper,the deletion of any programme,the renaming of any programme,the amendment of admission criteria for any programme,substantial changes to the structure of a programme, such as changes to the duration or points value or extensive changes to the papers comprising the programme,significant resourcing or financial implications,any changes not covered above requiring submission or reporting of an academic proposal to the Committee on University Academic Programmes ( CUAP ).Nominating proposalsWhen a proposer submits an academic proposal to an academic Division for consideration, the embedded Specialist from Academic Committees and Services may nominate the academic proposal for the expedited approval process if the Specialist judges the academic proposal to satisfy the criteria above (see clause 2 above) and to be of a routine and low-risk nature.In determining whether an academic proposal is routine and low-risk, the Specialist should consider: whether the academic proposal recommends a common type of change to a paper or programme, andwhether the academic proposal is likely to significantly disadvantage a student or group of students, andwhether the academic proposal carries any risk of negatively impacting the reputation of the University.When a proposal is submitted to more than one academic Division or will have a significant impact on more than one academic Division, the embedded Specialists in the relevant Divisions should consult with each other and arrive at a consensus if the academic proposal is to be nominated for the expedited approval process.Review and outcomeThe Associate Dean (Academic) for the relevant Division \u2013 after considering any feedback or consultation, which they may seek at their own discretion \u2013 may: recommend approval for the nominated academic proposal as submitted, orrecommend approval for the nominated academic proposal subject to minor revisions and/or further consultation with relevant parties, orrefer the nominated academic proposal for consideration through the standard approval process.When a nominated academic proposal is submitted to or has a significant impact on more than one academic Division, each of the Associate Deans (Academic) for the relevant Divisions should consult with each other and arrive at a consensus if the nominated academic proposal is to be recommended for approval (see sub-clause 4(a)(i)) or recommended for approval subject to conditions (see sub-clause 4(a)(ii)).The embedded Specialist should provide a summary of any nominated academic proposals recommended for approval or for approval subject to conditions to the Secretary to AC, who shall notify the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) of these recommendations.The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) shall consider the recommendations described in clause 4(c) \u2013 requesting documents for the nominated proposals at their own discretion \u2013 and may: approve any nominated proposal as recommended, orapprove any nominated proposal subject to minor revisions and/or further consultation with relevant parties, orrefer any nominated proposal for consideration through the standard approval process, commencing with AC.In the case of academic proposals approved or recommended for approval subject to minor revisions and/or further consultation in accordance with clause 4(a)(ii) or clause 4(d)(ii), the Academic Committees and Services Office shall confirm when the requirements for approval or recommendation have been met, in consultation with the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) or relevant Associate Dean(s) (Academic) as appropriate.Implementation and notingOnce an academic proposal has been approved or has met the set conditions of approval for the expedited approval process, the Academic Committees and Services Office shall: inform the proposer, andprovide a copy of the academic proposal and any required revisions to relevant staff in Student Experience and the Information Systems Support Group so that the changes recommended in the academic proposal may be put into effect, andprovide a summary of the approved change to be noted by the relevant Divisional Academic Board(s); AC; and Senate.Relevant staff in Academic Committees and Services, Student Experience, or the Information Systems Support Group \u2013 who would normally be members of the Pre-Academic Committee Admin Group \u2013 may incorporate minor revisions to the approved change \u2013 in consultation with the proposer or other parties as appropriate \u2013 prior to or shortly following implementation for the purpose of ensuring that the approved change is consistent and compatible with normal University administrative processes and systems.Any member of a relevant committee notified of a change approved under the expedited approval process (see sub-clause 5(a)(iii)) may request further information regarding the approved change, including the proposal documents associated with the change, via the Secretary for the committee of which they are a member.6.Rescinding approvalIn extraordinary circumstances where the implementation of an approved change notified to a relevant committee (see sub-clause 5(c)(ii)) appears likely to significantly disadvantage a student or group of students or to have a significant negative impact on the reputation of the University, that committee may rescind approval for the change in question and refer the academic proposal recommending that change for consideration through the standard approval process. In such cases, the Secretary for the relevant committee should notify the proposer, relevant staff in Student Experience and the Information Systems Support Group, the Associate Dean(s) (Academic) who recommended approval for the change, and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academic) as soon as possible to advise of this outcome and halt or reverse implementation of the change in question.",

        "scope": "Organisational scope not found",
        "content": "IntroductionThe University is the beneficiary of over 420 individual trust funds held by the Foundation Trust. Each fund has a founding document, such as a trust deed or will, which governs the purpose for which the funds can be used, the manner in which this is decided and whether the capital balance needs to be retained. The distribution of income to support research and teaching activities from these funds is controlled by the Trustees of the Foundation Trust.Information on trust funds available to each cost centre and the purposes for which they must be used is available in the annual budget process or from the Accountant \u2013 Treasury Assets and Insurance, Financial Services Division.Distributions from Trust FundsDistributions to the University can only be made from prior year earnings. The balance available in each fund is shown in the Trust ledger (TL ledger) under dissection 9961 (unspent income from prior years). The University however suggests Departments retain enough funds to support two years of future distributions in these reserves for use in years when investment income may be insufficient. During the budget process, an estimate of the funds available for distribution is provided to Cost Centres in their budget packs.Distributions from trust funds can only be made in accordance with the original purposes of each fund. Sufficient expenditure must have taken place in the University to match the distribution. Distributions must be approved by the Head of the Department, or the Dean of the School or Faculty, before being made.All expenditure on trust funded activities must be accounted for in an appropriate departmental activity within the University. Expenditure may not be coded directly to a Foundation Trust account.A journal is used to transfer distributions from trust funds to the University to fund that expenditure. This journal is completed by Finance Advisory staff for the GST exclusive costs and can be done in the following ways: A lump sum at the end of the month covering all payments made during the month,A regular monthly lump sum,Individual journals covering individual payments, orAn annual journal covering all payments made during the year.This procedure ensures that Departmental accounts reflect income provided to the University by the Foundation Trust, and all research, teaching and admin expenditure is measured in the University's reporting of outputs.The General Ledger journal will always be: DR Trust Fund TL  xxxx.3795 (Trust Distributions to the University)  CR University  GL 10.xx.xxx.1921.00 (Distribution from Trusts) The Project Ledger (Q Accounts) journal will always be: DR Trust Fund  TL xxxx.3795 (Trust Distributions to the University)  CR University  PL xxxxxx.xx.Q.xx.1331.00 (Distribution from Trusts) Any other journal entries in the Trust Ledger will be the responsibility of Treasury staff in the Financial Services Division.At the end of each year Financial Services send out a form to be signed by the Head of the Department or the Dean of the School or Faculty to confirm that the funds distributed have been spent in accordance with the purposes of the Foundation Trust.A Financial Services Division audit of the 30 largest trust distributions will be completed at the end of the financial year to confirm that all distributions were made in accordance with the purposes of each trust fund.T Activities (little t's)These are tagged gifts and bequests, which are not Trusts, and are generally known as little t's. The capital balances reside within cost centre accounts as T activities and are not required to be maintained permanently. These accounts are similar to carry forwards, but for three notable differences: They are interest bearing,Each fund may be fully expended provided the purpose/s given by the donor are met, andThe balance sits in dissection 9962Authorised expenditure is coded to the appropriate dissection within the T activity.

The JSON data includes multiple references to \"Trust Distributions to the University\" and other dissections (e.g., TL xxxx.3795, PL xxxxxx.xx.Q.xx.1331.00) without much explanation of what these terms mean or how they relate to each other. It would be helpful if more context were provided to clarify the purpose of these references.\n\nOverall, while there may not be significant issues with the structure of this policy document, some refinements could improve clarity and reduce redundancy."

        "content": "SummaryIn principle a Contractor should not be undertaking a core activity of the University (for example: teaching, tutoring, curriculum development, and research work); or performing services exclusively for the University, which also applies to former staff who have resigned applying to contract back to undertake similar work.The engagement of a Contractor may include the following circumstances: the provision of specialist professional services for projectsthe provision of specific one-off services, andon occasion the delivery of lectures.The following entities will not be engaged under a Contract for services (unless approved under exceptional circumstances): current Employees of the University, as any additional work should be managed using a variation to an employment agreementformer employees (engaged to undertake employment of similar nature of work to their previous employment) of the University.All Contracts for Services should be reviewed annually.The Contractor must not start performing services until the Agreement with an Independent Contractor contract has been signed by both parties.Determining the status of the person or entityIn most cases a casual or fixed term employment agreement is the appropriate course. The Employment Relations Act 2000 requires stated grounds for such short or limited arrangements, e.g. a specific project or translation services. The University preference is for employment agreements however the University accepts that for some situations it is appropriate to have a Contract for Services.To determine the correct arrangement, an assessment needs to be undertaken whether the individual is an employee or contractor. The IRD ERA and the courts have determined various tests to determine the 'real relationship'. Section 3 demonstrates the main principle differences between being an Employee or a Contractor.Subject to the results of; an initial discussion with the Divisional HR ManagerSection F - Initial Independent Contractor Determination Check, andSection G - Detailed Independent Contractor Determinationa formal compliance check undertaken by the Divisional HR Manager.If it is determined that a person or entity should be engaged as a Contractor, the person or entity will be offered a Contract for Services in accordance with these guidelines.If it is determined that the person or entity should be employed as an Employee, a recruitment process will apply.Principle differences between an Independent Contractor and an Employee\u00a0 INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR(Sole Trader or Company)EMPLOYEE Contract for Service Agreement of Service Legislation CoverageIs not subject to the provisions of the Employment Relations Act, breaches of contract are found in common law and statute law.

An employee has right to raise a grievancePayment\n             Contractors provide certain outputs for a defined price usually through a lump sum payment. Schedular payments may be deducted if applicable. \n          \n             Employees are usually paid for a number of hours which are not related to their output. Payment is by wages/salary. \n           Health and Safety\n             The University and Contractor both have responsibilities. \n          \n             University primarily responsible. \n          Tax\n             If a Sole Trader, the University may need to make schedular payment deductions. If a Company, no tax deducted by the University. The Company is responsible for their own tax. \n          \n             University deducts PAYE. \n          SupervisionContractors are responsible for management of work output:provides own tools, transport, skillschoose whether to be availablehas choice of whom they work for as they may have other clientscan sub-contract to another person to provide that service if stipulated in the contract.Employees will work under supervision of another person:employer can control what, how, when and hours of and where the employee will workemployee attends a workplace (cannot send someone else in his/her place).GST\n             Sole Traders may or may not be GST registered, this is considered in terms of IRD thresholds. Companies must invoice inclusive of GST. \n          \n             Not applicable. \n          Insurance\n             Contractor must have both public liability and indemnity insurance. \n          \n             University's responsibility. \n          ACC\n             PaymentsContractor's responsibility. \n          \n             University's responsibility.

Holiday Pay\n             Not paid by the University, may be payable by the contractor, if it has employees. \n          \n             Payable on taking Annual Leave, or may be paid in employee's hourly rate for casual employees. \n           Sick Leave\n             Not paid by the University, may be payable by the contractor, if it has employees. \n          \n             University's responsibility. \n           Parental Leave\n             Contractor's responsibility. \n          \n             University's responsibility. \n          Existing EmployeesIf an individual is an existing employee of the University, a Contract for Services will not be appropriate, unless approved under exceptional circumstances. There are risks associated with both tax through the IRD and with ERA requirements with regards to the nature of the relationship. There are other implications for the University in regards to existing on-site employment agreements.If the individual is an employee for another organisation, then it is unlikely they will be a contractor. Unless the individual can provide evidence to satisfy the IRD self-employed contractor definition that in addition to being employed they are also in business on their own account as a contractor.InsuranceThe contractor must have insurance to the value of five times the contract fee. This must be maintained for three years following completion of the contract. Questions regarding insurance can be emailed to fsd.insurance@otago.ac.nzConsiderations for Entering into a Contract for ServicesIt is important to clearly define where the funding for the work to be undertaken is coming from i.e. departmental budget or research or other external funding source.Ensure that the proposed engagement does not give rise to any conflict of interest, and that satisfactory references for the contractor have been obtained.Check Contracting Manager has delegated financial approval to negotiate a Contract for Service.Non Research Funding Contracts ProcessThe Contracting Manager (person responsible for the engagement) will download and complete the Application to ENGAGE an Independent Contractor Form available on the Human Resources website.If the contract spans more than one budget period, this will require the Chief Operating Officer's (COO) approval.Once the Application to ENGAGE an Independent Contractor Form has been completed and approval has been obtained from the Delegated Approver and the Chief Financial Officer (where required), forward the paperwork to the Divisional HR Manager for compliance checking. Allow five working days for the compliance checking process to be completed.On receipt of approval to proceed from the Divisional HR Manager, the Contracting Manager will: download and complete the Agreement with an Independent Contractor Template and arrange with the Contractor for them to sign the Contract and initial each page (bottom right)ensure there are neither new clauses added nor clauses removed from the templateensure the signatory in the Department has designated authority to sign.Forward the Contract to the Divisional HR Manager for signature on behalf of the University.The original (signed) Contract is returned to the Contracting Manager for payment processing and filing. A copy is retained by the Divisional HR Manager.Research Funded Contracts ProcessDue to the nature of the research environment, the Research and Enterprise Office have a separate contracting requirement.If the funding is for research or commercial work please contact the Research Advisor/Enterprise Manager for your area in the Research and Enterprise Office. If the contract is related to a funding application, the decision on whether the staff required for the research will be an employee or contractor may have an impact on the application.Payment for Services of ContractorThe Contracting Manager will determine the appropriate payments method in discussion with the Divisional HR Manager. Refer to the Payment Flowchart.A contractor may wish to apply to IRD for a Certificate of Exemption (COE) from tax on schedular payments. If a contractor has this exemption, the payments are processed without deducting tax (schedular deductions). Further information is available on the link below:http://www.ird.govt.nz/industry-guidelines/winemakers/employers-wt-exemption.htmlIf a contractor has a Certificate of Exemption, payment for services will be processed through Financial Services Division (FSD).Where the Contractor is subject to schedular payments deductions, the Contracting Manager will forward the following documents to Payroll: copy of signed Agreement with an Independent Contractorcompleted Schedular Payment Account Details formcompleted IR330C Tax Rate Notification for Contractors (unless already held by Payroll)completed Bank Authority form (unless already held by Payroll)verification of Work Visa (where required)invoices for payments (note the Contractor's details and tax invoice details must match).Where the Contractor is not subject to schedular deductions and is a registered company, the Contracting Manager will forward the following documents to Financial Services Division (FSD): copy of signed Agreement with an Independent Contractor (can be emailed to accounts@otago.ac.nz)completed New AP Creditor Application (unless already a registered creditor)Certificate from Exemption from IRD (where applicable)verification of Work Visa (where required)invoices to be sent to Account Payable for payment as they arrive (note the Contractor's details and tax invoice details must match).No advance payment to a Contractor will be made for services to be rendered, before the contract period, except as expressly approved by the Delegated Approver and the Divisional HR Manager.Schedular Payment DeductionsDeductions from schedular payments are an IRD tax requirement and are deducted at source where the recipient is not an employee. Payments are subject to tax at a flat rate even if the contractor is registered for GST. Contracts that require schedular deductions will be processed for payment through Payroll.An IRD IR330C Tax Rate Notification for Contractors form is required to be completed by the Contractor otherwise an additional rate is applied ('no declaration rate') which is on top of the required schedular deduction. A Contractor may have a Certificate of Exemption which allows them to receive full payment without the deduction of schedular payments. This should be noted in the Agreement with an Independent Contractor document once it is confirmed that the certificate is current.Different schedular deduction rates apply to different activities and these rates should be checked with the Divisional HR Manager. For Non Resident Contractors different rates apply; again the Contractor could obtain an exemption certificate from the New Zealand IRD. These rates are detailed on the IRD webpage under Schedular Payments.Refer to the Payment Flowchart on the HR website for further details and to assist with determining whether the schedular payments need to be deducted for the contractor. If the Contractor is based overseas or is not a New Zealand resident, please contact the Divisional HR Manager.Contract ManagementContractors are engaged to meet specific business requirements and must be well managed. The Contracting Manager is responsible for ensuring that: the Contractor is properly inducted and appropriate access provided (such as with IT), particularly in regard to the University's Health and Safety and ITS policies and procedures; andall University property in the Contractor's possession is returned before the term of the Contract for Services expires.",

        "content": "1. Under Review Process\nWhen issues of progress first arise, the supervisor should discuss these with the candidate and appropriate steps should be taken to assist the candidate to improve their progress. If these less formal steps do not result in satisfactory improvement this Under Review Procedure should be initiated.The decision to place a candidate Under Review is made by the Dean of the Graduate Research School, usually on the recommendation of the candidate's supervisory team when they have ongoing concerns about progress and likelihood of completion, or when a progress report notes \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d progress. A supervisor's recommendation to place a candidate Under Review requires the endorsement of the Head of Department.The candidate will be formally notified by the Dean of the Graduate Research School that they are to be placed Under Review and at that time will be provided with a copy of this procedure. The candidate will also be informed of support services available and of an independent person (such as a Postgraduate Coordinator or senior academic in the department) to consult, in recognition of the stress that may be associated with this notification.Once the Dean of the Graduate Research School has confirmed that a candidate is to be placed Under Review, it is the role of the supervisors, in conjunction with the candidate and the Head of Department, and in consultation with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, to prepare an Under Review Memorandum detailing the conditions for the Under Review Period. As a minimum, this memorandum should include: The duration of the Under Review period;The research work that is to be submitted for consideration by the end of the Under Review period;The required quality of the work, i.e. it needs to be at a doctoral level, and in final draft form;The assistance to be provided during the period, including the meetings that will be held;Possible outcomes from the Review; andThe signatures of the candidate, supervisors and Head of Department(s). Examples of Under Review Memorandum requirements can be provided by the Graduate Research School.In the event of any disagreement over the terms of the Under Review Memorandum, or any unreasonable delay in its completion, the terms of the memorandum may be settled by the Dean of the Graduate Research School and issued to the candidate.When a candidate is Under Review it is expected that the department(s) will take active steps to provide reasonable support and opportunity for the candidate to rectify progress issues and if possible meet the requirements of the Under Review Memorandum.At the end of the Under Review period the primary supervisor, in consultation with any co-supervisors and the Head of Department, will provide a report to the Dean of the Graduate Research School advising the candidate's progress against the requirements of the Under Review Memorandum.If the supervisors and the Head of Department are satisfied with progress, the Dean of the Graduate Research School may determine that the candidate can continue in the degree.If the supervisors and/or the Head of Department continue to be concerned with progress or if the Dean of the Graduate Research School considers there to be other reasons to do so, the Dean of the Graduate Research School in consultation with the supervisors and the Head of Department, shall arrange an independent assessment of the candidate's work to determine if it is of a standard to allow continuation in the programme.If this independent assessment finds the candidate's work is of a standard to allow continuation in the programme, the Dean of the Graduate Research School may determine that the candidate can continue in the degree.Continuation in the programme under (h) or (j) may be on the basis that the candidate is no longer Under Review or may be subject to a further Under Review Period and a new Under Review Memorandum.If the independent assessment raises concern that the candidate's work is not of a standard to allow continuation in the programme, the Dean of the Graduate Research School will refer the matter to the Graduate Research Committee for consideration of termination of the candidature under the processes of clause (2) below.\n2. Terminating doctoral candidature after Under Review period\nWhere a recommendation is made that candidature be terminated, the Graduate Research School will: Investigate possible options for transfer into an alternative programme of study, including investigating fee and visa implications.Contact the candidate advising them that the termination of their candidacy is being considered, advising them of any alternative study options that have been identified, and providing them with the opportunity to provide a written response to the material on the basis of which the matter is to be considered.In considering a recommendation for termination, the Graduate Research Committee will take into account: Any relevant background file data on the candidate provided by the Dean of the Graduate Research School;The recommendation of the supervisors;A letter from the candidate (if they wish to contest the recommendation for withdrawal from the doctoral programme). Note that while the availability of options for transfer into another degree shall be explored for the benefit of the candidate, the availability or otherwise of such an option will not be taken into account in the Graduate Research Committee's decision as regards termination of candidature.If the Graduate Research Committee endorses termination of candidature (with or without a recommended transfer into a different degree programme), the Dean of the Graduate Research School will inform the candidate and supervisors of this recommendation, advise the candidate of support services available to assist them to cope with this result, and alert them to the process for seeking Leave to Appeal the decision.\u00a0\u00a0The candidate will also be advised that they can opt to transfer programme/withdraw from the degree (whichever is applicable) voluntarily, in which case they must advise the Dean of the Graduate Research School of their decision to do so within 10 working days of being sent the decision letter.If the candidate does not communicate a decision to withdraw voluntarily or transfer from the doctoral programme and/or apply to the Registrar to seek leave to appeal within 10 working days of receiving the decision letter, then the Graduate Research Committee will withdraw the candidate permanently from the doctoral programme.",

Lack of standardization:\n   - The policy data contains some duplication of language and concepts, which could be avoided by standardizing key phrases and definitions throughout the document.\n\n4. Overemphasis on procedural steps:\n   - Some sections of the policies focus excessively on specific procedures, rather than providing clear guidance on the underlying principles or rules governing the process.\n   - For example, the policy 'Terminating doctoral candidature after Under Review period' outlines detailed steps to be taken by the Graduate Research School, but does not provide a clear rationale for why these steps are necessary.\n\n5. Unclear decision-making processes:\n   - Some sections of the policies outline procedures that could be open to interpretation, and do not provide clear guidance on how decisions should be made.\n   - For example, the policy 'Terminating doctoral candidature after Under Review period' states that the Graduate Research Committee will \"take into account\" certain factors when considering a recommendation for termination, but does not provide further clarification on what these factors are or how they should be weighed."

        "scope": "All staff employed by the University for a continuous period of twelve months or more, excluding casual and student employees.",
        "content": "General principlesStaff can apply to purchase Additional Leave in one-week blocks to a maximum of 5 one-week blocks in a 12-month period.Additional Leave is not annual leave and the provisions of the Holidays Act 2003 do not apply.All applications to purchase must be given reasonable consideration by Heads and must adhere to the Additional Leave Policy.Heads are encouraged to consider all aspects of an application, including the impact on the staff member, their colleagues, students, their customers, the area in which the staff member works as well as the staff member's annual leave balance.Staff wishing to apply are not required to provide any specific reasons for their application and can make an application at any time.Additional leave of one-to-five-week blocks will accrue over a 12-month period and can be ongoing.Request to purchase Additional LeaveFormal written applications to purchase Additional Leave must be made to the Manager / HOD using the Additional Leave Application Form.Where a staff member holds appointments in different departments, they must submit separate applications for each appointment. Each Head makes their own decision, therefore Additional Leave may not be approved in all departments.If a formal application is declined, the Head must advise the staff member of the reasons why using the considerations outlined in 1(d).Approved and declined application forms must be sent to HR Services as per the form instructions, and within 5 working days of the final decision.Payroll paymentsOn receipt of an Approved Additional Leave Application Form, payments will commence in the first available pay period.Payments are made via a negative pre-tax allowance.Salary and allowances are included when calculating the payment amount.Additional Leave payments will reduce your superannuation contributions as superannuation is calculated on eligible gross earnings.Payments will occur until the block of Additional Leave has been paid for or will continue if the Additional Leave is ongoing.Taking Additional LeaveAdditional Leave balances will appear in the staff web kiosk as a separate leave type and will accrue on a daily basis over a 12-month period.The booking of and approval to take Additional Leave is via the Staff Web Kiosk.Staff are expected to discuss their leave plans with the Head before submitting a request to take Additional Leave.Staff and Head are expected to maintain Additional Leave balances at no more than 5 weeks at any point in time.Changes to Additional LeaveIf a staff member increases or decreases their Hours / FTE , remaining Additional Leave payments will be adjusted. Completion of a Change in Hours / FTE Form will authorise this.If a staff member increases or decreases their remuneration (e.g. salary increase, allowance increase or decrease, etc), remaining Additional Leave payments will be adjusted. The Additional Leave Application Form will authorise this.When there is a change to salary, including allowances the remaining Additional Leave payments will be adjusted, including for leave purchased but yet to use.If a staff member is eligible under clause 4.(c) of the Additional leave Policy to reverse already taken or approved to be taken Additional Leave, the Leave Reversal Request Form must be completed and sent to HR Services within 5 days of the final decision.Balance on cessation of employmentIf a staff member ceases employment and has an Additional Leave balance, it will be paid out in their final pay at their normal pay rate current at the time they ceased employment.Related policies, procedures and formsAdditional Leave Purchase Request FormAdditional Leave PolicyAnnual Leave PolicyAdditional Leave Application Form (forthcoming)Change of Hours / FTE FormLeave Reversal Request Form (online form)Flexible Working Request ProcedureContact for further informationIf you have any queries regarding the content of this procedure or need further clarification, contact the HR Manager, Promotions and Remuneration.Human Resources \u2013 Promotions and Remuneration\n\n\n                .register-container {\n                    display: flex;\n                    gap: 50px;   \n                }\n                .button--colour-primary-b {\n                    gap: 5px;   \n                }\n            ",
        "q1_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified the following policies that contain unnecessary content:\n\n1. Additional Leave Purchase Request Form - The form instructions and the registration container are not part of the policy itself.\n2. Change of Hours / FTE Form - Similar to the previous one, the online form is not part of the policy document.\n\nThese two forms seem to be related to supporting documentation or administrative procedures that are external to the core Additional Leave Policy itself.",
        "q2_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified the following policies that contain parts that are actually Procedures, not Policies (i.e., they contain instructions on how to do something, rather than rules or principles):\n\n1. **Additional Leave Procedure** - This policy contains detailed instructions on how to apply for Additional Leave, what information is required, and the procedures for approval and payment.\n2. **Change of Hours / FTE Procedure** - Although it's called a \"Procedure\", this section seems more like a procedure than a policy as it outlines the steps to be taken in case of changes to hours or FTE.\n3. **Leave Reversal Request Procedure** - This section outlines the process for requesting the reversal of already taken or approved Additional Leave, which is more of a procedural step than a policy principle.\n\nThe other policies, such as the **Additional Leave Purchase Request Form**, **Change of Hours / FTE Form**, and **Leave Reversal Request Form (online form)**, seem to be related to supporting documentation or administrative procedures that are external to the core Additional Leave Policy itself.",
        "q3_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified the following policies that contain inconsistencies or structural flaws:\n\n1. **Additional Leave Purchase Request Form** - This policy seems unnecessary as it is a form instructions and not part of the actual policy.\n2. **Change of Hours / FTE Form** - Similar to the previous one, this form is also related to administrative procedures rather than the core Additional Leave Policy itself.\n\nThese two policies seem to be supporting documentation that are external to the main policy document, which appears to be the **Additional Leave Procedure**.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to highlight that the other policies mentioned in the **q2_response**, such as **Change of Hours / FTE Procedure** and **Leave Reversal Request Procedure**, appear to be more procedural steps rather than policy principles. They outline specific actions or procedures to be taken in certain situations, which is not typical of a policy document.\n\nOverall, it seems that the Additional Leave Policy document could be condensed by removing the extraneous forms and procedures, and focusing on the core rules and principles outlined in the procedure section.",
