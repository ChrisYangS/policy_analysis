All regulations apply to each scholarship unless the Schedule specifies otherwise. There are separate regulations for certain scholarships in Health Sciences and some other scholarships for particular purposes.\n2. Purpose\nDoctoral scholarships are awarded by the University Council, on the recommendation of the Senate, to candidates proceeding to a course of supervised doctoral study at this University. These scholarships are normally available only to students seeking to obtain their first doctoral qualification. Candidates may be awarded one University of Otago doctoral scholarship only.\nMasters\u2019 scholarships are awarded by the University Council, on the recommendation of the Senate, to candidates in the first year of their thesis research for a Master\u2019s degree which constitutes entry to the PhD course at this University. These scholarships are available only to students seeking to obtain their first research-based Master\u2019s qualification.\n\n\n3. Academic Criteria and Eligibility\nDoctoral and Masters' scholarships will be awarded on the basis of:\nThe applicant's academic record:1In the case of an applicant for a doctoral scholarship who has completed a Master\u2019s degree by papers and thesis (at least 0.75 EFTS), the grades of all relevant2 advanced level papers counting towards the award of the degree and the thesis will be taken into account. An explanation of the time taken for completion of the thesis may be requested and considered by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee if the thesis has taken more than 2 EFTS (2 full- time years) to complete.In the case of an applicant for a scholarship without a Master\u2019s degree including a thesis, the grades of all relevant2 advanced level papers counting towards the award of the applicant\u2019s most relevant degree will be taken into account.In the case of applicants whose prior qualifications have been awarded by other universities, the University shall calculate a GPA score using what it considers to be the most relevant2 papers and grades provided on the applicant\u2019s academic transcripts.Certificate of Proficiency and Pass/Fail papers will not be taken into account in the calculation.The applicant's potential for, or record of, research.The advice, recommendation and/or ranking of the relevant Head of Department.The strategic research and business priorities of the Academic Division in which primary supervision of the applicant's research will take place.Eligibility for doctoral and Masters' scholarships:Unless otherwise stated in these conditions or within the schedule, Doctoral and Masters\u2019 scholarships are open only to Domestic Fee Paying Students.3 International candidates studying for professional doctorates are eligible to apply but if awarded a scholarship the tuition fee waiver will be capped at the domestic rate.In the case of applicants for a doctoral scholarship, confirmation of the scholarship is dependent on approval of their application for admission to the relevant doctoral programme and completion of the enrolment procedure.In the case of applicants for a Master's scholarship, confirmation of the scholarship is dependent on approval of their application to register as a Master's candidate and completion of the enrolment procedure.\n\n\n4. Tenure\nA doctoral or Master\u2019s scholarship may be awarded with full-time or part-time tenure. Part- time tenure will only be granted in cases where full-time study is not practicably possible and where the candidate can demonstrate that they are particularly well prepared for part-time study. Applications to transfer from part-time to full-time tenure will be considered, provided that the candidate has shown satisfactory progress and can provide evidence of the ability to commit to full-time study. Applications to transfer from full-time to part-time tenure will be considered only on grounds of ill health (a medical certificate will be required), significant carer responsibilities (for example: pre-school aged child; school aged child as a sole parent with limited support; or child/partner/parent with a serious illness or disability) or for career related reasons. Part-time tenure for career related reasons is subject to approval by supervisors. Transfers of this sort may only occur at the beginning of a semester. Emoluments for candidates holding part-time tenure will be pro-rated as appropriate.During tenure of the scholarship the candidate must undertake research in Dunedin or at the University of Otago, Christchurch or University of Otago, Wellington, unless a special case for exemption from this requirement has been previously approved by the convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee.Tenure of a doctoral scholarship is for three full-time years (or part-time equivalent), or until the thesis is submitted (whichever period is the shorter), subject to the provision of satisfactory annual Progress Reports by the Department in which the student is registered. For candidates in professional doctorates, tenure may also cover periods of coursework prior to and after the thesis enrolment period, but will not exceed three years.Tenure of a Master's scholarship is for one full-time year (or part-time equivalent), or until the thesis is submitted (whichever period is the shorter.) Students must be in the first year of their thesis research to be eligible for a scholarship.A shorter period of tenure shall be awarded in cases where two months or more of registration as a candidate for the degree (or for the part of the degree eligible for scholarship support) has been completed at the time of award.Overseas tenure of a Master's scholarship is not normally permitted.Overseas tenure of a doctoral scholarship is not normally permitted.\u00a0On delegation from the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, the convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee, may agree to: a period of normally up to one year\u2019s overseas tenure for a period following domestic (New Zealand-based) commencement if it can be shown by the Head of Department concerned, that access to facilities or opportunities overseas is essential to the completion of the project. In such circumstances the emolument of the scholarship shall continue to be paid in New Zealand currency and into a New Zealand bank account. No additional financial assistance is available through the Scholarship for travel or other expenses incurred if a period of overseas tenure is approved.partial tenure for commencement overseas, where the student is unable to travel to New Zealand to begin their study, but remote research and supervision arrangements have been approved. The terms of partial overseas tenure are set out in section 5 below of these regulations.\n\n\n5. Emolument\nDoctoral and research Masters' scholarships consist of the following components for the tenure of the scholarship, unless the attached Schedule specifies otherwise:\nA tuition fee waiver for the degree for which the scholarship is given.4 (Note: Applicants should be aware that a University of Otago scholarship does not waive fees for any papers that may be taken in addition to the full-time thesis course for which the scholarship is given unless approved by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee.)Should a student by way of government policy become subject to international tuition fees during scholarship tenure, the student will be responsible to pay the tuition fee costs over and above the tuition fee waiver at the domestic rate.For students studying on campus in New Zealand, or with approved distance study in New Zealand, a living allowance paid in equal monthly instalments for the tenure period of the Scholarship.5International doctoral students approved partial tenure for commencement overseas (under Regulation 4(g)ii) shall only be eligible for a monthly living allowance upon the conclusion of remote study and their arrival on campus in New Zealand. Living allowance entitlement will be calculated by deducting time already spent on research since commencement overseas from 36 months full-time study or 72 months part-time study, whichever is applicable. No backdating of living allowance to the time of remote commencement will occur.\n\n\n6. Additional Income\nA doctoral or research Master's scholarship may not be held concurrently with any other scholarship/s worth more than half the annual emolument of a University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship, in the case of doctoral study, or a University of Otago Research Master's Scholarship, in the case of Master's study. Research Grants, Travel Grants, and any Grants specifically designated to cover research costs, for which the candidate must present receipts, are not considered to be scholarships in this instance.Full-time scholarship recipients may not accept paid employment for more than 500 hours across a period of twelve months, without prior permission from the Scholarships and Prizes Committee (for part-time scholarship recipients, the maximum employment hours are 1000 hours across a period of twelve months). Otherwise, there is no specific limit on any other form of additional income, provided that the student\u2019s progress on his or her studies is maintained at a satisfactory level.University of Otago employees who are pursuing their Master's or doctorate as part of their employment are ineligible for University of Otago scholarship funding.\n\n\n7. Applications\nApplications for scholarships are made online through the University\u2019s website. An invitation to apply for scholarships is sent once an application for admission to the relevant qualification is complete. Applications may be made at any time and should normally accompany the application for admission to the relevant qualification. Where an applicant is completing a Master\u2019s degree which includes enrolment in papers prior to enrolment in a thesis, application should normally be made following completion of those papers. An invitation will be sent when enrolment in the thesis component of the Master\u2019s degree is completed.\n\n\n8. Academic Qualifications\nStudents whose degree has been conferred at any university other than a New Zealand or Australian University should check the requirements for credential evaluation, available here.\nApplicants whose qualifications are from countries in the list available on the website must provide an original or certified copy of the transcript from their university.Qualifications from all other countries must be referred to: Education Credential Evaluators, Inc.6\nThe applicant is required to pay for the evaluation, with the applicant and the University of Otago each receiving a copy of the resulting evaluation report.\n\n\n9. Acceptance and Deferment\nAn offer of a doctoral or research Master\u2019s scholarship must be accepted or declined within the time frame specified in the offer. There is provision for the acceptance to be subject to the eventual outcome of any application that the candidate may have also made for external scholarships.\nFollowing acceptance of the offer of a scholarship, the candidate must be enrolled for the degree concerned no later than the date specified in the letter of offer.\nTenure of a scholarship may be deferred only in exceptional circumstances. A candidate whose application for deferment is declined may apply again for a scholarship in a later year.\nIf the candidate defers (i.e. has a temporary suspension) during study, the scholarship payments will cease until the candidate re-enrols. In cases of a retrospective deferral, the candidate will be given the option of either repaying the scholarship for the months deferred, or, upon re-enrolment, waiting the requisite number of months until payments continue.\n\n\n10. Cancellation\nUpon the termination of a Student\u2019s enrolment for any reason, or his or her withdrawal, any entitlement to ongoing scholarship funding shall cease. In such circumstances, the University may also require repayment (in part or full) of any scholarship payments already made. However, no repayment will be required of any amounts paid for a period in respect of which a student can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Convener of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee, the devotion of reasonable efforts towards the requirements of his or her degree.\nThe University of Otago may, at any time, suspend or terminate the scholarship, or require the forfeiture of such proportion of the scholarship as the University of Otago may determine, if it is not satisfied that the recipient is not appropriately enrolled, diligently pursuing their programme or if the recipient has brought the University of Otago, the scholarship or donors into disrepute.\n\n\n11.

Work is not re-marked.\n12. Retention of Scripts\n12.1 Examination scripts shall be retained by Departments for twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for that teaching period.\n12.2 Within the period of the start of week 7 to the end of week 12 following the official release of confirmed final results a student may, after completing an application form available from the University Information Centre, collect the original of that student's script from the Department concerned. In cases where an examination script is collected by a student no consideration will be given to any subsequent issue arising from the marking of that script, nor the addition or compilation of the marks. (Note: Some examination answers involving problem solving and multiple choice questions will not be returned to students, but may be seen within the Department concerned by arrangement.) After the end of week 12, Departments may dispose of all unclaimed examination scripts.\n12.3 Alternatively, a student may arrange through the Head of the appropriate Department to see that student's examination script for a particular examination in the presence of a member of the departmental staff within twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n12.4 A Distance Learning student who cannot reasonably visit the campus from which a paper is taught in order to view an examination script at the Department concerned may request a photocopy of the script by writing to the Director, Student Experience, within twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n13. Variations\n13.1 In any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Vice-Chancellor that an alteration or amendment to a University regulation involving a change in a course of study, or in examination requirements, has caused hardship to a student, the Vice-Chancellor may make such provision as he or she shall think fit for the relief of such hardship.\n13.2 In exceptional cases, the Vice-Chancellor may approve variations to the application of these regulations to ensure fairness to a student or students.\n14.
