These Regulations are to be interpreted in a manner which promotes that concept.Vehicles may never be driven or ridden on the Campus at a speed or in a manner which might interfere with the safety of pedestrians.Notwithstanding any rights which may be afforded to vehicle traffic under these Regulations, vehicles shall at all times and in all places on the Campus yield the right of way to pedestrians.Automobile AccessAccess to the Campus by automobiles shall be via those routes specifically designated for such access. Apart from emergency situations or for maintenance work by authorised trade and service vehicles all motorised vehicles shall be confined to designated access ways.Bicycles and Personal Transport DevicesThe riding of bicycles and use of personal transport devices on campus is prohibited, except in areas designated for their use by the Director of Property Services.Stunt and aerobatic manoeuvres, or any other activity which may cause disruption to University activities, undue risk to pedestrians or potential damage to property, are prohibited.Mobility AidsFor the purposes of these regulations, wheelchairs and other mobility aids used by people with disabilities are not considered vehicles and may be used on Campus provided that such use is undertaken with due regard for others.Observance of SignsUsers of vehicles on the Campus shall at all times observe all relevant markings and signs including those which define areas which are and are not available for use by specified vehicles.Markings and signs which are similar to those used by the New Zealand Transport Agency have the same meaning on the Campus as they do in any other public place.Speed LimitIn areas where they are permitted on the Campus, no vehicle shall be operated at any time in excess of 10 kilometres per hour.Parking and StorageVehicles shall not be parked or stored in any area other than those specifically designated for the parking or storage of that type of vehicle.The University may limit the use of designated parking spaces to particular staff or other persons associated with the University.Personal transport devices which are no larger than 1.2 metres x 50cm x 50cm may be stored on one's person, including in University buildings, except where this blocks egress or otherwise causes disruption to University activities.Any vehicle parked or stored in breach of these Regulations, or in a manner which does not conform to markings or signage, may be removed without notice. Any vehicle so removed may be recovered only upon the payment of all costs incurred in the removal of the vehicle from its unauthorised position.Charging of Electric VehiclesElectricity paid for by the University may not be used to charge electric vehicles except: at charge points designated by the Director of Property Services; orin University-owned accommodation, providing that any charging is of a bicycle or personal transport device owned by a resident of that accommodation.BreachAny student found to be in breach of the regulations may be subject to disciplinary action under the Student Conduct Statute 2021. A breach of the provisions of these regulations by a member of the staff of the University may be the subject of action under the staff member's employment agreement into which these regulations are incorporated.\n\n\n                .register-container {\n                    display: flex;\n                    gap: 50px;   \n                }\n                .button--colour-primary-b {\n                    gap: 5px;   \n                }\n            ",

It would be better to separate policy content from code snippets.\n\n4. **Unclear scope**: The 'scope' field is currently set to 'Organisational scope not found'. This information seems incomplete or incorrect, as it doesn't provide a clear understanding of the organization's jurisdiction or applicability of the regulations.\n\n5. **Lack of specificity in parking and storage rules**: While there are general guidelines for parking and storage, there could be more specific details regarding designated areas, time limits, and penalties for non-compliance.\n\n6. **Inconsistent use of terms**: The policy uses different terms to describe similar concepts (e.g., \"vehicle\" vs. \"automobile\"), which might cause confusion among stakeholders.\n\n7. **Potential overlap with other policies or regulations**: Some sections, such as those related to vehicle access and parking, might be overlapping with other policies or regulations within the organization. It would be beneficial to review these sections for potential redundancy or areas where integration with other policies is needed.\n\nThese are some of the potential issues I found in the provided policy data.",

Approval of Dunedin Student Functions is to be sought through completion of the form prescribed by the Proctor. Student Functions which are not Dunedin Student Functions may be held only in accordance with the approval of the Head of the campus for whose students the function is arranged.Dunedin Student Functions must be registered by lodging completed approval forms with the Proctor not less than 7 days prior to the proposed function, provided that the Proctor may accept later registration where he or she is satisfied there have been reasonable grounds for the delay.

        "content": "\n1. Preamble\nThese regulations apply to the scholarships for Doctoral and Master\u2019s study listed in the attached Schedule. All regulations apply to each scholarship unless the Schedule specifies otherwise. There are separate regulations for certain scholarships in Health Sciences and some other scholarships for particular purposes.\n2. Purpose\nDoctoral scholarships are awarded by the University Council, on the recommendation of the Senate, to candidates proceeding to a course of supervised doctoral study at this University. These scholarships are normally available only to students seeking to obtain their first doctoral qualification. Candidates may be awarded one University of Otago doctoral scholarship only.\nMasters\u2019 scholarships are awarded by the University Council, on the recommendation of the Senate, to candidates in the first year of their thesis research for a Master\u2019s degree which constitutes entry to the PhD course at this University. These scholarships are available only to students seeking to obtain their first research-based Master\u2019s qualification.\n\n\n3. Academic Criteria and Eligibility\nDoctoral and Masters' scholarships will be awarded on the basis of:\nThe applicant's academic record:1In the case of an applicant for a doctoral scholarship who has completed a Master\u2019s degree by papers and thesis (at least 0.75 EFTS), the grades of all relevant2 advanced level papers counting towards the award of the degree and the thesis will be taken into account. An explanation of the time taken for completion of the thesis may be requested and considered by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee if the thesis has taken more than 2 EFTS (2 full- time years) to complete.In the case of an applicant for a scholarship without a Master\u2019s degree including a thesis, the grades of all relevant2 advanced level papers counting towards the award of the applicant\u2019s most relevant degree will be taken into account.In the case of applicants whose prior qualifications have been awarded by other universities, the University shall calculate a GPA score using what it considers to be the most relevant2 papers and grades provided on the applicant\u2019s academic transcripts.Certificate of Proficiency and Pass/Fail papers will not be taken into account in the calculation.The applicant's potential for, or record of, research.The advice, recommendation and/or ranking of the relevant Head of Department.The strategic research and business priorities of the Academic Division in which primary supervision of the applicant's research will take place.Eligibility for doctoral and Masters' scholarships:Unless otherwise stated in these conditions or within the schedule, Doctoral and Masters\u2019 scholarships are open only to Domestic Fee Paying Students.3 International candidates studying for professional doctorates are eligible to apply but if awarded a scholarship the tuition fee waiver will be capped at the domestic rate.In the case of applicants for a doctoral scholarship, confirmation of the scholarship is dependent on approval of their application for admission to the relevant doctoral programme and completion of the enrolment procedure.In the case of applicants for a Master's scholarship, confirmation of the scholarship is dependent on approval of their application to register as a Master's candidate and completion of the enrolment procedure.\n\n\n4. Tenure\nA doctoral or Master\u2019s scholarship may be awarded with full-time or part-time tenure. Part- time tenure will only be granted in cases where full-time study is not practicably possible and where the candidate can demonstrate that they are particularly well prepared for part-time study. Applications to transfer from part-time to full-time tenure will be considered, provided that the candidate has shown satisfactory progress and can provide evidence of the ability to commit to full-time study. Applications to transfer from full-time to part-time tenure will be considered only on grounds of ill health (a medical certificate will be required), significant carer responsibilities (for example: pre-school aged child; school aged child as a sole parent with limited support; or child/partner/parent with a serious illness or disability) or for career related reasons. Part-time tenure for career related reasons is subject to approval by supervisors. Transfers of this sort may only occur at the beginning of a semester. Emoluments for candidates holding part-time tenure will be pro-rated as appropriate.During tenure of the scholarship the candidate must undertake research in Dunedin or at the University of Otago, Christchurch or University of Otago, Wellington, unless a special case for exemption from this requirement has been previously approved by the convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee.Tenure of a doctoral scholarship is for three full-time years (or part-time equivalent), or until the thesis is submitted (whichever period is the shorter), subject to the provision of satisfactory annual Progress Reports by the Department in which the student is registered. For candidates in professional doctorates, tenure may also cover periods of coursework prior to and after the thesis enrolment period, but will not exceed three years.Tenure of a Master's scholarship is for one full-time year (or part-time equivalent), or until the thesis is submitted (whichever period is the shorter.) Students must be in the first year of their thesis research to be eligible for a scholarship.A shorter period of tenure shall be awarded in cases where two months or more of registration as a candidate for the degree (or for the part of the degree eligible for scholarship support) has been completed at the time of award.Overseas tenure of a Master's scholarship is not normally permitted.Overseas tenure of a doctoral scholarship is not normally permitted.\u00a0On delegation from the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, the convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee, may agree to: a period of normally up to one year\u2019s overseas tenure for a period following domestic (New Zealand-based) commencement if it can be shown by the Head of Department concerned, that access to facilities or opportunities overseas is essential to the completion of the project. In such circumstances the emolument of the scholarship shall continue to be paid in New Zealand currency and into a New Zealand bank account. No additional financial assistance is available through the Scholarship for travel or other expenses incurred if a period of overseas tenure is approved.partial tenure for commencement overseas, where the student is unable to travel to New Zealand to begin their study, but remote research and supervision arrangements have been approved. The terms of partial overseas tenure are set out in section 5 below of these regulations.\n\n\n5. Emolument\nDoctoral and research Masters' scholarships consist of the following components for the tenure of the scholarship, unless the attached Schedule specifies otherwise:\nA tuition fee waiver for the degree for which the scholarship is given.4 (Note: Applicants should be aware that a University of Otago scholarship does not waive fees for any papers that may be taken in addition to the full-time thesis course for which the scholarship is given unless approved by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee.)Should a student by way of government policy become subject to international tuition fees during scholarship tenure, the student will be responsible to pay the tuition fee costs over and above the tuition fee waiver at the domestic rate.For students studying on campus in New Zealand, or with approved distance study in New Zealand, a living allowance paid in equal monthly instalments for the tenure period of the Scholarship.5International doctoral students approved partial tenure for commencement overseas (under Regulation 4(g)ii) shall only be eligible for a monthly living allowance upon the conclusion of remote study and their arrival on campus in New Zealand. Living allowance entitlement will be calculated by deducting time already spent on research since commencement overseas from 36 months full-time study or 72 months part-time study, whichever is applicable. No backdating of living allowance to the time of remote commencement will occur.\n\n\n6. Additional Income\nA doctoral or research Master's scholarship may not be held concurrently with any other scholarship/s worth more than half the annual emolument of a University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship, in the case of doctoral study, or a University of Otago Research Master's Scholarship, in the case of Master's study. Research Grants, Travel Grants, and any Grants specifically designated to cover research costs, for which the candidate must present receipts, are not considered to be scholarships in this instance.Full-time scholarship recipients may not accept paid employment for more than 500 hours across a period of twelve months, without prior permission from the Scholarships and Prizes Committee (for part-time scholarship recipients, the maximum employment hours are 1000 hours across a period of twelve months). Otherwise, there is no specific limit on any other form of additional income, provided that the student\u2019s progress on his or her studies is maintained at a satisfactory level.University of Otago employees who are pursuing their Master's or doctorate as part of their employment are ineligible for University of Otago scholarship funding.\n\n\n7. Applications\nApplications for scholarships are made online through the University\u2019s website. An invitation to apply for scholarships is sent once an application for admission to the relevant qualification is complete. Applications may be made at any time and should normally accompany the application for admission to the relevant qualification. Where an applicant is completing a Master\u2019s degree which includes enrolment in papers prior to enrolment in a thesis, application should normally be made following completion of those papers. An invitation will be sent when enrolment in the thesis component of the Master\u2019s degree is completed.\n\n\n8. Academic Qualifications\nStudents whose degree has been conferred at any university other than a New Zealand or Australian University should check the requirements for credential evaluation, available here.\nApplicants whose qualifications are from countries in the list available on the website must provide an original or certified copy of the transcript from their university.Qualifications from all other countries must be referred to: Education Credential Evaluators, Inc.6\nThe applicant is required to pay for the evaluation, with the applicant and the University of Otago each receiving a copy of the resulting evaluation report.\n\n\n9. Acceptance and Deferment\nAn offer of a doctoral or research Master\u2019s scholarship must be accepted or declined within the time frame specified in the offer. There is provision for the acceptance to be subject to the eventual outcome of any application that the candidate may have also made for external scholarships.\nFollowing acceptance of the offer of a scholarship, the candidate must be enrolled for the degree concerned no later than the date specified in the letter of offer.\nTenure of a scholarship may be deferred only in exceptional circumstances. A candidate whose application for deferment is declined may apply again for a scholarship in a later year.\nIf the candidate defers (i.e. has a temporary suspension) during study, the scholarship payments will cease until the candidate re-enrols. In cases of a retrospective deferral, the candidate will be given the option of either repaying the scholarship for the months deferred, or, upon re-enrolment, waiting the requisite number of months until payments continue.\n\n\n10. Cancellation\nUpon the termination of a Student\u2019s enrolment for any reason, or his or her withdrawal, any entitlement to ongoing scholarship funding shall cease. In such circumstances, the University may also require repayment (in part or full) of any scholarship payments already made. However, no repayment will be required of any amounts paid for a period in respect of which a student can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Convener of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee, the devotion of reasonable efforts towards the requirements of his or her degree.\nThe University of Otago may, at any time, suspend or terminate the scholarship, or require the forfeiture of such proportion of the scholarship as the University of Otago may determine, if it is not satisfied that the recipient is not appropriately enrolled, diligently pursuing their programme or if the recipient has brought the University of Otago, the scholarship or donors into disrepute.\n\n\n11.

        "content": "1. Title, Approval and Commencement and Revocation\n1.1 These regulations are the Examinations and Assessment Regulations 2014.\n1.2 These regulations were approved by the Senate of the University at its meeting of 30 April 2014 pursuant to clause 4.1 of the Academic Statute 2011.\n1.3 These regulations apply, and the former Examinations Regulations are revoked, with effect from 1 May 2014.\n2. Internal Assessment and Terms Requirements\n2.1 The final grade for most papers (not including dissertations, theses, or other research exercises) incorporates the results for formal examinations conducted under the authority of the Senate at the end of the teaching period concerned (final examinations). Additionally, or alternatively, some or all of the final grade may be based on results for essays, assignments, laboratory or other practical work, and tests (sometimes known as terms tests) conducted by individual departments and schools (internal assessment).\n2.2 Some programmes and papers require that students gain terms (i.e. fulfil certain specified conditions such as completing oral, written or practical work) before they may sit final examinations. Terms are gained by completing established requirements such as attending classes or completing oral, written or practical work. Students must familiarise themselves with any terms requirements for any programmes or papers for which they are enrolled.\n3. Final Examination Only Enrolment\n3.1 A student, who has failed to pass a paper, subsequently may apply for Final Examination Only enrolment and the following shall apply:\nApplication for Final Examination Only enrolment must be made on the prescribed form, available from the University's website or AskOtago, to the Head of Department concerned by 10 January for summer school papers, 1 March for full year and first semester papers, and 31 July for second semester papers. A fee will be charged if an application is approved. Approval is at the discretion of the Head of Department and will only be given to students who have performed to a satisfactory standard.If the application is approved, the student is permitted to have internal assessment results and terms carried over in the paper and to sit the final examination again without attending any part of the course.This concession is not required to be available in all papers and, where available, may be granted only once in a particular paper.The examination must be attempted at the end of the semester or full year in which a paper is offered next, except that it may be attempted earlier if the paper concerned is offered in a summer school.A student who has been granted Final Examination Only enrolment in a paper may cancel the enrolment for that paper until 1 February for a summer school paper or 10 May for a first semester paper or 10 September for a second semester or full year paper. Later cancellations will be permitted only in exceptional circumstances.Final Examination Only candidates are not entitled to attend any lectures, laboratories, or tutorials, or receive assistance from academic staff, or have access to electronic holdings of course material, or receive printed course material.Final Examination Only enrolments are not taken into account in any consideration of a student's status as a full-time or part-time student.\n4. Examinations and Assessment\n4.1 Candidates are required to sit examinations at times and places which shall be determined by the Senate.\n4.2 The examinations shall be carried out in such manner as the Senate may prescribe. Candidates shall be subject to these regulations and to the Examination Rules and any other supplementary regulations prescribed and promulgated by the Senate from time to time.\n4.3 No candidate shall communicate with an examiner in regard to an examination either in the examination script or otherwise before the official release of confirmed final results, except through the Director, Student Experience.\n5. Special Consideration in Final Examinations\n5.1 At all University final examinations, other than Special Examinations, a student:\nwho has been prevented from taking any final examination through illness or other circumstances beyond his or her control; orwho considers that performance in any final examination has been seriously impaired by illness or other exceptional circumstances beyond his or her control at the time of, or in the 14-day period immediately prior to the examination,may apply for special consideration.\n5.2 Candidates seeking special consideration for all programmes in Dentistry, Medical Laboratory Science, Medicine, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy and Radiation Therapy, or in papers for Health Sciences postgraduate programmes other than papers with no clinical content which have been specifically excluded by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health Sciences), should apply to the relevant Department, School or Faculty Office.\n5.3 Students in all other programmes or papers should apply to the Student Administration.\n5.4 The special consideration may consist of the following, except that the provisions in clauses (d) and (f) are not available for students enrolled in programmes identified in regulation 5.2:\na decision that no action is justified or appropriate; oradjusting an examination mark; orgranting a Special Examination in the paper concerned; orgranting an Aegrotat Pass in the paper concerned, where the examiners certify that the candidate's performance and competence in the paper were sufficiently above the minimum standard required to pass the paper (normally taken as a C+ standard or better); orgranting the choice of an adjusted examination mark or a Special Examination; orgranting the choice of an Aegrotat Pass or a Special Examination.\n5.5 Honours, distinction, or credit may not be awarded to a student who has received Aegrotat Passes in examinations for more than 30% of a programme, or for more than 30% of the final year's course in the case of a four-year degree programme.\n5.6 A claim for special consideration must be made within five calendar days of the last final examination for which special consideration is being sought and must be supported by a Health Declaration or other appropriate evidence.\n5.7 A student may not apply for special consideration after the date of the official release of confirmed final results.\n5.8 These regulations should be read in conjunction with any relevant examination regulations set out for individual programmes.\n6. Special Consideration for Internal Assessment\n6.1 Students may seek special consideration in internal assessment by applying to the relevant Head of Department, by whom, or under whose authority, appropriate special consideration may be granted.\n6.2 The extent of any special consideration allowed will reflect the weighting placed on the piece of work in question in determining the final overall result for the paper concerned. Where the assignment or internal assessment test counts significantly towards a final result, a formal Health Declaration will be required.\n7. Examinations Missed through Preventable Circumstances\n7.1 A student who is a finalist (i.e. enrolled for a course of study sufficient to complete a qualification in the semester or year concerned) or a postgraduate student, and who misses a final examination through genuine error, such as mistaking the time or date of the examination, may apply to sit a Special Examination.\n7.2 Application must be made in writing to the Director, Student Experience, no more than five calendar days after the missed examination.\n7.3 Each application must be accompanied by the prescribed fee.\n7.4 Applications shall be considered by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division in which the examination was held.\n7.5 Each applicant shall have no more than one application approved under this provision during their programme of study.\n8. Academic Misconduct\n8.1 When a student is suspected of Academic Misconduct:\nin connection with an examination; or,through a breach of a rule dealing with the conduct of examinations; or,in the preparation or submission of any written, oral or other work, including work in electronic format which counts towards the attainment of a pass in any subject, or of any dissertation, thesis or other research exercise,the circumstances shall be considered in the manner provided by the Academic Statute 2011 and the University's Student Academic Misconduct Procedures.\n8.2 All students have a responsibility to be aware of acceptable academic practice in relation to the use of material prepared by others, and for taking all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that no breach of academic integrity occurs.\n9. Grades and Levels of Awards\n9.1 When percentage marks are recorded for examinations or following the assessment of any thesis, dissertation, research essay, research project, or other course component, the following key shall be used for translating the marks into letter grades:\n\n         90-100 \n      \n         A+ \n      \u00a0\n         75-79 \n      \n         B+ \n      \u00a0\n         60-64 \n      \n         C+ \n      \u00a0\n         40-49 \n      \n         Fail D \n      \u00a0\n         85-89 \n      \n         A \n      \u00a0\n         70-74 \n      \n         B \n      \u00a0\n         55-59 \n      \n         C \n      \u00a0\n         below 40 \n      \n         Fail E \n      \u00a0\n         80-84 \n      \n         A- \n      \u00a0\n         65-69 \n      \n         B- \n      \u00a0\n         50-54 \n      \n         C- \n      \u00a0\n9.2 In awarding a class of honours for a degree or credit or distinction for a degree or diploma, the average mark for the relevant course components shall be calculated and the following key shall be used to determine the standard of award of the qualification:\n 80-100\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Class Honours, or Distinction 70-79\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second Class Honours (Division I), or Credit 60-69\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second Class Honours (Division II) 50-59\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third Class Honours\nIn the case of the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery, the award of overall passes with distinction in the second, third, fifth, and sixth year courses of the programme, the award of passes in individual disciplines in the sixth year with distinguished performance, and the award of the degrees with distinction shall be determined according to criteria approved by the Faculty of Medicine.\nIn the case of the degree of Master of Teaching and Learning, the award of the degree with distinction or with credit shall be determined according to criteria approved by the College of Education.\n9.3 The University's official Grade Point Average (GPA) for external purposes is based on a 9-point scale with letter grades assigned numerical values.\n\n         A+ \n      \n         = \n      \n         9.0 \n      \u00a0\n         B+ \n      \n         = \n      \n         6.0 \n      \u00a0\n         C+ \n      \n         = \n      \n         3.0 \n      \u00a0\n         D \n      \n         = \n      \n         0.0 \n      \n         A \n      \n         = \n      \n         8.0 \n      \u00a0\n         B \n      \n         = \n      \n         5.0 \n      \u00a0\n         C \n      \n         = \n      \n         2.0 \n      \u00a0\n         E \n      \n         = \n      \n         0.0 \n      \n         A- \n      \n         = \n      \n         7.0 \n      \u00a0\n         B- \n      \n         = \n      \n         4.0 \n      \u00a0\n         C- \n      \n         = \n      \n         1.0 \n      \n9.4 A 'fail' result in a paper for which letter grades are assigned, or a 'disqualified' result in any paper, shall be assigned a numerical value of 0.\n9.5\u00a0\u00a0All other results shall be excluded from GPA calculations, including ungraded pass results, distinction and credit passes, fail results from papers for which letter grades are not assigned, 'completed', 'incomplete', 'absent' or 'withdrawn' results, zero-point papers, and credit granted on the basis of study completed elsewhere or the recognition of other prior learning (RPL credit).\n9.6 In order to calculate the GPA, the numerical value of each grade is multiplied by the number of points for the paper. The multiplied figures are then summed and divided by the total number of points for all papers included in the calculation. GPAs are displayed to one decimal place on an academic record.\n10. Failure to Comply with Regulations\n10.1 Where a student has not complied with a University regulation in respect of a course or an examination (including a regulation relating to payment of course or examination fees), the Senate shall have power, having given the student reasonable opportunity of remedying the non-compliance:\nto decline to credit to the student's course any subject taken at the said examination; orto suspend, for such a time as it may think fit, the release to the student of the results of any examinations; orto withhold the recommendation by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Dean concerned for the conferring of the degree, or presentation of the diploma.\n11. Recounts\n11.1 Any candidate for a degree, diploma or other qualification may have the marks recounted in any paper or subject by making written application to the Director, Student Experience, within four weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n11.2 Each application must be accompanied by the prescribed fee.\n11.3 A recount of marks shall cover a careful re-check of the marks recorded by the examiner, and ensure that no answer or any portion of an answer, or work done during the teaching period which counts towards the final result, has been overlooked. Work is not re-marked.\n12. Retention of Scripts\n12.1 Examination scripts shall be retained by Departments for twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for that teaching period.\n12.2 Within the period of the start of week 7 to the end of week 12 following the official release of confirmed final results a student may, after completing an application form available from the University Information Centre, collect the original of that student's script from the Department concerned. In cases where an examination script is collected by a student no consideration will be given to any subsequent issue arising from the marking of that script, nor the addition or compilation of the marks. (Note: Some examination answers involving problem solving and multiple choice questions will not be returned to students, but may be seen within the Department concerned by arrangement.) After the end of week 12, Departments may dispose of all unclaimed examination scripts.\n12.3 Alternatively, a student may arrange through the Head of the appropriate Department to see that student's examination script for a particular examination in the presence of a member of the departmental staff within twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n12.4 A Distance Learning student who cannot reasonably visit the campus from which a paper is taught in order to view an examination script at the Department concerned may request a photocopy of the script by writing to the Director, Student Experience, within twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n13. Variations\n13.1 In any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Vice-Chancellor that an alteration or amendment to a University regulation involving a change in a course of study, or in examination requirements, has caused hardship to a student, the Vice-Chancellor may make such provision as he or she shall think fit for the relief of such hardship.\n13.2 In exceptional cases, the Vice-Chancellor may approve variations to the application of these regulations to ensure fairness to a student or students.\n14. Presentation of Theses\n14.1 General Provisions\nIt is the responsibility of candidates for degrees which require the submission of a thesis to provide copies of the thesis for examination and for permanent retention by the University as specified in these regulations.The degrees affected by these regulations are: Doctor of Philosophydoctorates in professional disciplines (Doctors of Business Administration, Clinical Dentistry, Education, Musical Arts)other doctoral degrees, commonly called higher doctorates (Doctor of Commerce, Dental Science, Laws, Literature, Medicine, Music, Science)Masters' degrees requiring a thesisHonours degrees requiring a thesis (Bachelor of Biomedical Sciences with Honours, Bachelor of Medical Science with Honours, Bachelor of Radiation Therapy with Honours).Except for candidates for higher doctorates, every candidate for a degree affected by these regulations must be enrolled for the degree concerned at the time the thesis is submitted for examination, unless special permission has been given by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor concerned or the Graduate Research Committee.For the purposes of these regulations, research portfolios for the degrees of Master of General Practice, Master of Primary Health Care, and Master of Travel Medicine are to be treated as theses.These regulations do not apply to dissertations, research essays, research projects, or similar works required for degrees and diplomas.\n14.2 Provisions Applying to Theses\nTheses shall be in typescript on an A4 size page with a margin of not less than 30mm. The size of page may be varied only with the approval of the Head of Department concerned.Particulars of requirements of format, typing, citation, and digital submission are available on the University Library Thesis Information webpage.Every copy of a thesis submitted must include an abstract, not exceeding 500 words, in a form suitable for publication.In relevant cases, the thesis must state that the research was approved by the appropriate ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the University's Responsible Practice in Research \u2013 Code of Conduct and all necessary laboratory compliance permits.Resubmission of a thesis is not permitted except on the recommendation of the examiners.Where a thesis has been rejected the author is not precluded from being a candidate on a future occasion for the degree in which he or she has previously failed.\n14.3 Submission of Theses for Examination\nTheses must be submitted in a digital format meeting all the requirements of these regulations.Where a degree requires submission of additional material separate to the main thesis for examination, such material must also be submitted in an appropriate digital format.Notwithstanding clauses 14.3(a) and (b), the Dean, Graduate Research School or nominee may approve the examination copy of the thesis and/or any accompanying material being submitted in a non-digital or alternative format where digitisation is not practically achievable.The digital submission of the thesis must be accompanied by a declaration signed by the candidate that confirms: the work was done by the candidate personally, or that the thesis contains co-authored workthat the material has not previously been accepted in whole, or in part, for any other degree or diploma, andthat the thesis has been checked and contains no plagiarism.\n14.4 Submission of Finalised Theses\nThe degree for which the thesis is required shall not be awarded until a final digital copy of the thesis, corrected if necessary, has been deposited in the University's online research repository.Where a degree requires final submission of additional material separate to the main thesis, such material must also be deposited in an appropriate digital format in the University's online research repositoryNotwithstanding clauses 14.4(a) and (b), the Dean, Graduate Research School may approve the final version of the thesis and/or any accompanying material being deposited in a non-digital or alternative format where digitisation is not practically achievable.The final approved version of the thesis must be accompanied by a declaration signed by the candidate and their primary supervisor (or Head of Department, on behalf of primary supervisor) that: specifies the level of access to the thesisconfirms that the thesis provided is the final approved version, andconfirms that the thesis and any additional material provided does not infringe copyright.Final approved versions of theses shall be made publicly available through the University's online research repository, subject to the following restrictions: in order to safeguard original content while material from the thesis is prepared for publication, a candidate, with the endorsement of their primary supervisor, may prevent public access to the full-text of their thesis via the research repository for up to six months after the date of deposit ('abstract-only access').if additional restrictions are needed, an embargo must be approved before submission of the finalised thesis. For a thesis for a Master's or Honours degree: in certain circumstances the Pro-Vice-Chancellor concerned may, after consultation with the Director, Research and Enterprise (where appropriate), approve restrictions on access via a thesis embargo. For a doctoral thesis: in certain circumstances the Dean of the Graduate Research School may, after consultation with the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor, and the Director, Research and Enterprise (where appropriate), approve restrictions on access via a thesis embargo.any time extensions to an embargoed thesis, or abstract-only access thesis, must be approved prior to the expiry of the embargo or abstract-only period.\n\n\n                .register-container {\n                    display: flex;\n                    gap: 50px;   \n                }\n                .button--colour-primary-b {\n                    gap: 5px;   \n                }\n            ",

In this case, I found one such policy:\n\nThe 'Information_and_communications_Technology_Regulations_2014' policy contains detailed instructions on how to use ICT resources (e.g., \"Each User of ICT shall: comply with all applicable New Zealand law...\", \"take all reasonable precautions to secure his or her passwords...\") and what actions are prohibited (e.g., \"No User of ICT shall: use or attempt to use ICT in a manner that will incur costs to the University without the consent of...\"). \n\nThese sections appear to outline specific procedures for users of ICT resources, rather than setting out general policies or rules.",
        "q3_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified several inconsistencies and structural flaws in the policies:\n\n1. The 'Information_and_Communications_Technology_Regulations_2014' policy contains unnecessary content. Specifically, it has a space for cross-references to other policies, but there are no actual cross-references or words like \"referenced by\" in its own content.\n\n2. The 'Information_and_communications_Technology_Regulations_2014' policy is more accurately described as a procedure document, rather than a policy document. It contains detailed instructions on how to use ICT resources and what actions are prohibited, which appears to be more of a procedural guideline than a general policy or rule.\n\n3. The 'q1_response' and 'q2_response' fields contain extraneous information that is not relevant to the analysis of the policies. These fields appear to be part of some kind of automated response system and do not provide any meaningful insights into the content of the policies.\n\n4. There are no clear guidelines or standards for formatting or structure in the provided JSON data, which makes it difficult to evaluate the consistency and coherence of the policies.\n\n5. The 'register-container', '.button--colour-primary-b' styles, and other CSS classes appear to be extraneous and do not provide any relevant information about the content of the policies.\n\nIn summary, the main inconsistencies and structural flaws in the policies are:\n\n* Inconsistent formatting and structure\n* Lack of clear guidelines for policy development and review\n* Unclear definitions and boundaries between procedures and policies\n* Excessive or unnecessary content\n\nThese issues need to be addressed to ensure that the policies are coherent, consistent, and effective.",
        "q4_response": "Based on the analysis provided in the JSON data, I have identified several inconsistencies and structural flaws in the policies. Here is a summary of my findings:\n\n**Inconsistent formatting and structure**\n\n* The policies do not follow a consistent format or structure, making it difficult to evaluate their content.\n* There are no clear guidelines or standards for formatting or structure in the provided JSON data.\n\n**Lack of clear guidelines for policy development and review**\n\n* The policies lack explicit guidance on how they were developed, reviewed, or updated.\n* There is no clear process for reviewing or revising the policies to ensure their accuracy, completeness, or effectiveness.\n\n**Unclear definitions and boundaries between procedures and policies**\n\n* The policies blur the lines between procedures and general rules, making it difficult to determine which sections apply to which users (e.g., staff, students).\n* There is no clear definition of what constitutes a policy versus a procedure.\n\n**Excessive or unnecessary content**\n\n* One policy, \"Information_and_Communications_Technology_Regulations_2014\", contains unnecessary space for cross-references to other policies.\n* The policy appears to be more accurately described as a procedure document than a policy document due to its detailed instructions on how to use ICT resources and what actions are prohibited.\n\nTo address these issues, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Develop clear guidelines for policy development, review, and update processes.\n2. Establish a consistent format or structure for all policies to facilitate easy evaluation and understanding.\n3. Define clear boundaries between procedures and general rules to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.\n4. Remove unnecessary content from policies to improve their clarity and relevance.\n\nBy addressing these inconsistencies and structural flaws, the policies can be made more coherent, consistent, and effective in guiding users of ICT resources.",

Where a student enrols in first semester and subsequently adds second semester on-campus papers to their enrolment, they will be charged the remainder of the full year's Student Services Fee.Students enrolling in Summer School shall be liable to pay one sixth of the Student Services Fees.\u00a0\u00a0That amount shall be credited towards the liability (if any) the student may have for Student Services Fees in respect of further enrolment in the same calendar year.The following shall be exempt from paying the Student Services Fees: Staff members (\u201cStaff member\u201d means a person who is employed by the University on a half time or greater basis and has a contract of employment with the University of 10 months or longer, provided that in any case of difficulty in applying this definition the matter shall be finally determined by the Director, Human Resources);Students enrolled for distance papers only;Students enrolled for interest only and not eligible to sit degree examinations;A student specifically exempted from the fee, in full or in part, under the authority of the Director, Student Services.A student exempted from the Student Services Fees is not eligible to use any of the services to which the Fees contribute.Doctoral students and students enrolled for the thesis component of a Master's degree:who enrol after the beginning of an academic year shall be liable in that year for a pro-rata Student Services Fees calculated on a quarterly basis in respect of each quarter or part quarter of the year in which they are enrolled;who have submitted their theses for examination, and who are not enrolled for any other papers, are entitled, upon surrender of their University ID card, to a pro-rata refund of the Student Services Fees which they have paid and shall thereupon cease to be eligible to use any of the services to which the fee contributes.Students to whom clauses 3.3(a), (c) or (d) or 3.5(b) apply may at the discretion of the Director, Student Services, be permitted to pay the Student Services Fees voluntarily to be entitled to use the services.",

This cross-reference seems unnecessary as it is simply directing to another section within the same document instead of providing additional information.\n\nHowever, I couldn't confirm any other policy documents containing such unnecessary content, assuming that all policies have been reviewed thoroughly.",

While this content is necessary for implementing the policy, it could be considered procedural rather than policy-related.\n\nThe other policy documents do not appear to contain procedural content in the same way. They primarily outline rules and principles governing Tuition Fees and Student Services Fees, without providing detailed instructions on how to implement these rules.",

        "q4_response": "Based on the provided JSON data, I have identified some redundancy and potential structural flaws in the policies:\n\n1. **Inconsistent scope**: The policy document 'Fees_Exemption_Regulations' contains both 'University-wide' and 'Doctoral students and Master's degree' as scopes. It seems that 'Doctoral students and Master's degree' is a subset of 'University-wide'. To avoid redundancy, it would be better to use 'University-wide' as the scope for this policy document.\n2. **Procedural content**: As mentioned in q2_response, the policy document 'Fees_Exemption_Regulations' contains procedural content in the form of instructions on how to do something (e.g., surrendering their University ID card to receive a refund). While this content is necessary for implementing the policy, it could be considered separate from the actual policy rules and principles. It would be better to separate this content into a separate document or appendix.\n3. **Cross-references**: The policy document 'Fees_Exemption_Regulations' contains cross-references to clauses 3.3(a), (c), or (d) and clause 3.5(b). While these cross-references are necessary for referencing other sections within the same document, it would be better to reorganize the content to avoid unnecessary repetition.\n4. **Lack of clear definitions**: There is no clear definition of what constitutes a 'full-time' or 'half-time' employment basis in clause 3.3(a). It would be better to provide a clear definition for this term to avoid ambiguity.\n\nOverall, while the policies seem well-structured, there are some potential areas for improvement regarding redundancy and structural flaws.",
