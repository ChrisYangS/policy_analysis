       "5. **Potential for unnecessary cross-references**: The incomplete data doesn't provide enough context to assess whether there are unnecessary cross-references to other policies within this single record.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Organizational scope not defined**: Since the 'scope' field is empty, it's unclear what specific aspects of an organization this policy applies to or which departments/staff members should be aware of its details.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Better structure**: If complete data were available, a better structure for the policy database could involve organizing policies by category (e.g., equity, diversity, strategic frameworks), with clear hierarchies and subcategories to facilitate navigation and understanding of each policy's scope and content.\n",

       "Based on the provided JSON data, here is an assessment of potential inconsistencies or structural flaws in the policies:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Lack of clear procedures**: While the policy outlines guidelines and conditions for private use of campus grounds, it does not provide explicit instructions or procedures for approval, consultation, or decision-making processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Unclear scope**: The scope section mentions that the guidelines apply to University-owned and leased property on the Dunedin campus, excluding colleges and spaces within buildings. However, it would be beneficial to clarify what exactly is excluded from this scope (e.g., are certain areas within buildings still subject to these guidelines?).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Overly broad definitions**: The policy defines \"commercial activities\" broadly, stating that they will normally only be approved where they are part of an event meeting specific criteria (2(a) and 2(b)). However, the policy does not provide clear guidance on what constitutes a commercial activity in this context.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Lack of standardization**: The locations suitable for private use include multiple options, but it would be helpful to have a more standardized or list-based format for specifying these areas, rather than relying on parenthetical comments.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Unclear conflict resolution process**: While the policy mentions that conflicts with other activities may lead to the University's needs taking precedence, it does not provide clear guidance on how such conflicts should be resolved or escalated.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Potential for ambiguity in risk assessment**: The policy references a risk assessment process, but it is unclear what specific factors or criteria would be considered when evaluating the potential risks associated with an event.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Limited clarity on approval process**: While the policy mentions that approval may be granted or denied based on various factors, it does not provide clear guidance on how to initiate or follow up on these requests.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **No apparent standardization of communication channels**: The policy references multiple departments and individuals (e.g., Property Manager, Vice-Chancellor, Registrar), but it is unclear what the standard protocol is for communicating with these parties or escalating concerns.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Lack of clarity on fees**: While the policy mentions that commercial activities may be charged a fee by the Property Management Unit, it does not provide clear guidance on what this fee would cover, how it would be calculated, or when payment would be due.\n",
