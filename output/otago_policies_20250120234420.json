This information should be used in conjunction with other related supporting policies or guidelines that apply to a particular position. For example, for positions that are categorised as Confirmation Path refer to the Confirmation Path Policy. Similarly for positions with promotion and/or salary progression options, the Academic Promotions webpage, Promotions Policy, M\u0101ori Strategic Framework and the Performance and Salary Review webpage would provide essential information.The information statement for candidates and the Guidelines for Academic Titles will determine selection criteria and interview programme.Principles to be adopted in the Selection CriteriaEquity and Diversity Appointments should be on merit: Merit is defined as giving preference to the person who is best suited to the position. This normally refers to the qualifications, experience and attributes required for any given position and are related to the information statement.Equity and Diversity: The University recognises that members of equity groups are more likely than others to experience barriers to achieving their full potential and/or to be underrepresented (M\u0101ori Strategic Framework and Equity and Diversity Policy).There must be no unlawful and inappropriate discrimination in the selection process. All panel members need to be aware of the risk of discrimination in the selection/appointment process, as this has both legal implications and consequences for the diversity of the University. The Equal Employment Opportunities Policy and the Ethical Behaviour Policy outline what constitutes discrimination.Panel members are asked to be aware of unconscious bias and to focus solely on the criteria outlined in the selection criteria. Unconscious bias happens automatically and is triggered by our brain making quick judgments and assessments of people and situations, influenced by our background, cultural environment and personal experiences. Irrespective of how fair minded we consider ourselves to be, most people have some degree of unconscious bias. The University of Otago makes every effort to eliminate the effects of unconscious bias in its selection process.  Panel members are asked to find out about their own unconscious bias:Visit the Project Implicit websiteFind out more about the effects of unconscious bias in this short videoPanel members must also become familiar with, and adhere to, the University's Equal Employment Opportunities, Good Employer and Affirmative Action policies.Confidentiality and privacy The privacy of candidates will be respected throughout the selection process. Candidate information (including CVs) should be circulated only to the selection panel.If it is deemed appropriate for a wider review of CVs (beyond the panel), the Chair will determine the most appropriate method, taking into account applicant privacy and the most effective method of collating feedback. Please refer to Section 4 (h) (Role of the Head of Department and Chair) for further details.Any intention to share CVs beyond the selection panel should be made explicit to the candidates.To ensure confidentiality, no member of the panel may report the views of any other member or what transpired in the course of the panels' deliberations, or release outside of the panel any information relating to applicants in the recruitment process.The University is seeking to attract and hire the best candidates: it is important candidates have confidence and trust in our recruitment process and the care of their personal information.It is the role of the Chair to communicate with candidates. Panel members must not speak to candidates about the process: this includes speaking about other candidates, or providing them with information about the process that is underway. It is the role of the Chair to communicate with applicants and to ensure any other communication is appropriate.The Chair has overall responsibility to ensure that privacy and confidentiality is maintained.Conflict of Interest Members of the selection panel should declare any conflict of interest to the Chair before the shortlisting and interview process begins. The Chair will decide if it is appropriate for the panel member to be part of the selection process. If they continue in the selection process, the panel should be made aware of the situation and the conflict of interest should be managed. Please refer to the Conflicts of Interest Policy or contact the Recruitment team for further guidance when the situation arises. If the Chair has a conflict of interest, please contact the Recruitment team for guidance.Role of the Head of Department and ChairWhilst the Head of Department (HoD) is usually the Chair, in some circumstances the HoD will appoint a Chair.The HoD will ensure that appropriate approvals are sought for the advert and panel membership. Refer to:Academic Authority to appoint Guidelines (PDF)Screening/Pre-selection: The Chair shall convene a panel to undertake screening of applicants (including a longlisting process) in order to arrive at a shortlist of candidates suitable for interviewing.Panel: The panel would normally comprise the Chair, the PVC/Dean (or nominated senior academic leader) and at least two other academic staff members. This could include a member of staff from the Department or a member of academic staff from the wider University. An HR/Recruitment team representative can be included as part of the panel if appropriate. When selecting the panel, the Chair will consider the strategic focus, expertise required, and the need to consult with relevant stakeholders or interested groups. Careful consideration should be given to selecting a diverse panel.Senior appointment considerations: The process for senior level appointments (i.e. Associate Professor and above) is similar to that for making other academic appointments except that approval for appointments rests, at Associate Professor, with the Staffing Advisory Committee, and for Professor appointments, the Vice-Chancellor. The information for candidates' statement for senior level appointments needs to follow an approved format and should be coordinated through the Recruitment team.The Chair is responsible for ensuring the selection process is appropriate for the position: fair, equitable and designed to clearly identify the most suitable candidates. This will include: Ensuring candidate enquiries are dealt with appropriately.Facilitating the shortlisting process and recording the reasons for decisions.Managing the interview programme and assigning topics to be covered by each panel member during the interview.Welcoming the candidate and introducing all the members of the panel.Facilitating questioning, ensuring continuity and time management.Recording and summarising initial panel feedback.Facilitating the decision making process and ensuring every effort is made to reach a unanimous decision.Recording final panel decisions and ensuring that records of recruitment decisions, including shortlisting and interview notes, are stored securely for 12 months then confidentially destroyed after this period.The interview programme for an academic position will typically include an interview, presentation of a formal research seminar to staff of the Department and invited guests, a teaching demonstration, and a programme of informal activities.The Chair will determine the most appropriate method for academic staff to view CVs of those shortlisted applicants who have accepted an invitation to participate in the interview programme. This will take into account candidate privacy and the most effective method of collating feedback. Ideally CVs will be available to view in a secure location, soft copies should not be circulated. Other application details, including the application forms, covering letters and references remain confidential to the panel. Please refer to Section 3 (b)(ii)(iii) (Confidentiality and privacy) for further details.Academic staff may provide written feedback to the Chair. Feedback will be invited during the interview programme \u2013 there will be a reasonable deadline, to allow for both reflection and to keep the recruitment process progressing efficiently. Written feedback will be submitted in confidence, summarised into a single document and be relevant to the selection criteria (as outlined in the information statement) of the vacancy. The Chair will collate and circulate feedback to the panel for consideration.At the conclusion of the selection process the Chair will also seek approval for the appointment of the recommended candidate in accordance with the University's specified appointment delegations. For further information, please refer to:Academic Authority to Appoint Guidelines (PDF)In recommending an appointment, the Chair (with support from the panel) will submit a brief statement explaining why the candidate selected is the most suitable appointee in terms of the field of the job as advertised, the selection criteria, the applicant's research record, teaching experience, and qualifications. This will include recommendation of the appointment level relative to the levels in the Department as evidenced by promotion outcomes for that Department/School.For advice on providing feedback to unsuccessful candidates, please contact Human Resources.Other considerationsCandidate impression of the University: remember that candidates are also assessing us as a potential employer, and their impressions of the University and the Department will have an impact on their decision making. All applicants will be evaluating: The University as a potential employer.The research profile of the Department.Facilities relevant to the candidate's teaching and research, such as laboratories and seminar spaces.The region as a place to live for themselves and any family.Department staff and other academics in the University as colleagues and potential research collaborators.Reference checking: depending on the role and preference of the Chair, reference checking can take place prior to shortlisting, or later in the process. The common format calls for written references from three to four referees. It can help to specify to referees what aspects of candidate's performance the panel would like them to comment on when requesting the reference, and a deadline for response.Video Conference / Telephone Interviews: When all or some of the shortlisted applicants are based elsewhere, the Chair may choose to conduct short interviews via telephone or video conferencing technology (e.g. ZOOM), with all shortlisted applicants, prior to bringing applicants to the Campus for the formal interview programme. The aim of the initial video interviews is to determine candidates' motivation for their application and to clarify various aspects from their application to assist the panel with their decision-making.Campus visits for shortlisted candidates: when arranging for a candidate to visit the campus, considerations should be given to the following arrangements: Organise travel and suitable accommodation (wherever possible, pay for travel arrangements rather than reimbursing the applicant). Please refer to the Travel and Travel Related Costs Policy for more details.As a minimum, ensure transport to and from the airport has been organised. Ideally, it would be most welcoming to have the applicant met by the Head of the Department (or nominee). This is particularly important for any applicants travelling internationally to attend the interview programme.Always check with applicants for any specific travel requirements, for example dietary and disability requirements or other reasonable accommodation for travel arrangements.Provide applicants with relevant information in preparation for their visit in the form of a letter of welcome, confirming the day and time of the visit, travel and accommodation arrangements, list of expenses that are reimbursable and contact information.An itinerary for the visit including a complete schedule of events/interview programme and the names and titles of individuals they will meet. Include any social events and any dress code.Ensure there is space in the itinerary for the candidate to have some free time to relax \u2013 particularly if they may be affected by jet lag.For all applicants who will need to relocate, ensure a meeting with a University of Otago relocation and settlement support specialist is scheduled as part of the interview programme.Provide the opportunity for applicants to request any equipment/IT requirements and any accessibility related requirements they may need.Internal or local applicants should be extended comparable courtesies as external applicants e.g. information provided, invitations to social events and access to equipment/IT support.Care should be taken to ensure the interview programme is equitable e.g. wherever practicable ensuring the same composition of guests at any informal events.Any staff contributing to the selection process should be made aware of the importance of objectivity. For example, attending all candidate seminars or none at all."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Adjunct_Guidelines_for_the_Awarding_of_the_Title", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Adjunct_Guidelines_for_the_Awarding_of_the_Title.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all academic activities.", "purpose": "The purpose of these Guidelines is to define the circumstances in which the title Adjunct can be awarded and to set out the approval processes. \n\nAdjunct Titles are awarded to persons who are undertaking activities which provide a significant contribution of benefit to the University, and to recognise the importance of the relationship between the appointee and the University.\nAdjunct Titles are normally associated with the appointment of specialised and leading academic and professional persons to a position within the University.\nAdjunct Titles are awarded to persons having such academic and professional eminence that were they a member of the permanent university academic staff they would be appointed at the same level.\nAdjunct appointments are employees for a small percentage (usually less than 10 per cent) of full-time equivalent salary.

Overview\nThe standards for appointment for a Divisional Associate Dean will be determined by these guidelines. Appointments will be made using the approved role descriptions.The Guidelines outline the criteria and level of Support Fund and FTE relief to be applied across all Divisions.Divisional Associate Dean positions will be funded by the Division.\n2. Appointment Process\nAppointment of a Divisional Associate Dean is approved by the Vice-Chancellor on the recommendation of the Pro-Vice-Chancellor.When recommending a Divisional Associate Dean appointment, the Pro-Vice-Chancellors should consider the following: the standardised generic role descriptions for Divisional Associate Deansthe Division-specific tasks and responsibilities, andthe FTE allocation appropriate for each Divisional Associate Dean role based on: the extra tasks required for a Divisionthe size of the Division and hence the quantum of work requiredthe extent of the administrative support from the Division for the role.Divisional Associate Dean appointments should be for an initial 3-year term. A further term or terms can be awarded. However, the total tenure of a Divisional Associate Dean will not normally exceed six years.Succession planning should, where possible, commence at least six months before the next Divisional Associate Dean commences.\n3. Associate Dean FTE allowance and FTE\nThe Pro-Vice-Chancellor will, in consultation with the relevant Academic Head to determine the type and extent of support and/or FTE relief.This will normally take the form of a specific reduction in the appointee's normal FTE to allow a reasonable allocation of time to perform their Divisional Associate Dean responsibilities.\n4. Departmental FTE Relief Principles:\nFTE relief is the amount of time a Divisional Associate Dean is allocated to undertake their Associate Dean role. This normally leads to an equivalent reduction in FTE in their normal academic role.Considerations for determining whether the departmental FTE will be reduced and if so, the extent of reduction will include: their current FTEthe breakdown of their teaching, research & service.Up to 0.2 FTE of a Divisional Associate Dean position will normally be considered as constituting the majority of the person's service component, except for professional service. This means the Divisional Associate Dean will do minimum service work for the home department.The freed-up departmental funds are to be used by the department to backfill the department's service requirements.The Division will fund the provision of FTE relief for Divisional Associate Dean positions.The relief funds can be used by the Head of Department to compensate for the reduction in departmental FTE. Examples include back filling the Divisional Associate Dean's service and teaching or funding research assistance.Where the Divisional Associate Dean is required to continue their departmental service, the Divisional Associate Dean will be given appropriate up to 0.2 FTE relief from teaching or research by the home department. That relief will normally be a 50/50 split between teaching and research.Where Divisional Associate Dean roles are more than 0.2 FTE, the released funds should be used by the home department to allow relief from departmental teaching and research (normally 50/50 split). Departmental service is expected to be a minimum.The minimum Research is 0.2 FTE and minimum Teaching is 0.2 FTE (unless specified in an employment contract).\n5. Divisional Associate Dean Support Funds:\nThe appointee to a Divisional Associate Dean role will be considered for an allocation of funds (\u201cthe Support Fund\u201d) to support their teaching and research activities.The use of the Support Fund will be determined after discussions between the Divisional Associate Dean, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor and the Head of Department.The Pro-Vice-Chancellor will approve the amount and usage of the Support Fund.The Support Fund will be scaled depending on the FTE.The Divisional Associate Dean will report annually on the usage of their fund to the Pro-Vice-Chancellor.The Support Fund cannot be paid as income to the Divisional Associate Dean."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Casual_Staff_Employment_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Casual_Staff_Employment_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These Guidelines apply to all areas of the University.", "purpose": "Staff employed on casual agreements provide an important resource for the University.

Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement\nUse of the University's Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement will ensure that all legal requirements are met, if they are completed properly, and used in accordance with the procedures set out in these guidelines. The agreement must always be accompanied by Terms and Conditions and the Employment Relationship Problem Resolution Process document.\nThe Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement allows payments to be made by submitting casual timesheets/payments requests as required. In situations where only one payment is appropriate (agreed fee, lump sum, few days work), Section F \u201cSingle payment Request\u201d can be used.\nBack to Index\n3. Time Limits and Renewals of Casual Employment\nPlease note that an agreement undertaken on this basis does not constitute a guarantee that work will be available to the employee during this period, and care should be taken that this is clearly understood. \nAll casual agreements must contain a finish date. Employees must not under any circumstances be allowed to work beyond the finish date of their written agreement. Agreements must always be signed by both parties before work commences in the position.For advice on the appropriate type of agreement and appointment procedure, please contact your Divisional Human Resources Manager or Payroll Services.Separate Agreements Required for each Position Where staff work in more than one casual job, a separate Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement is required for each different casual job entered into, i.e. jobs in different Departments or at different pay rates or involving completely different types of work.Staff employed by the University as general or academic staff on a permanent or longer fixed-term basis, and who undertake casual work in a completely separate position to their normal job that does not compromise their existing work commitments, must also have a casual employment agreement completed, in addition to Casual Staff Timesheet/Payment Requests. Where this occurs the Department's HOD/Manager should first discuss this with the Divisional Human Resources Manager.\nBack to Index\n4. Casual Staff Pay Rates\na. Rates from Established University Scales\nThe responsibility for offering casual staff employment agreements and pay rates has been devolved to Heads of Department, where the pay rate falls on the University's established pay scales. When deciding on a particular pay rate, please note the following points:\nConsult the appropriate University salary scales, notes and remuneration policy. Casual staff members must normally be paid on an hourly rate from the University's current scales. In the case of general staff positions paid on scale 1 the salary may not be above the midpoint of the appropriate level without prior approval from the Human Resources Division.Be aware of the precedent created by employing a casual staff member on a particular hourly rate. Should that person be successful in obtaining permanent employment of a similar nature at the University, they will expect a similar rate of pay. To avoid the problems that this may cause, the same remuneration policy that is used when employing permanent staff should be applied.\nb. Holiday Pay\nStaff employed on the Casual Staff Individual Employment Agreement will receive 8% holiday pay as they go.\nFor budgetary purposes, allow for this 8% holiday pay and for 0.53% for the ACC Employer Levy. However, when advising casual staff of hourly rates, the holiday pay and ACC Employer Levy should not be included in the rate quoted.\nc. Off Scale Special Rates or Agreed Fees\nThe University scales are to be used where there is a specific University rate which applies to the type of work to be performed. In special employment circumstances, special rates of pay not derived from the University pay scales may need to be used for one-off employment situations. Special rates may involve a fixed sum for the work, agreed fee, or a payment per session.\nThe use of off-scale special rates of pay and agreed fees requires Divisional approval. Divisional Heads may delegate their authority to one other person in the Divisional Office. In this event, the guidelines for the delegation should be clear including clarification over the circumstances that the Divisional Head should be consulted in a decision. Human Resources/Payroll Services are to be advised in writing of any such approved delegations.\nIn seeking Divisional approval for special rates, a full justification for the proposed rate must be provided, including an indication of the estimated time involved in completing the work, the rate the calculation is based upon and any market factors involved. The approved signatory should clearly sign each contract*.\nIn establishing agreed rates for single payments, it must be borne in mind that the final payment must not equate to less than the legal minimum wage.

Introduction\nThe appointment of suitably qualified, experienced, and independent thesis examiners is a critical element of the examination processes for graduate research degrees at any University. Independence of examiners is an important quality indicator of an institution\u2019s examination process, ensuring that examination is undertaken independently and is free of bias.A conflict of interest exists where a potential examiner has worked with the candidate on matters directly related to the thesis research. To ensure independence of the examination process, an examiner should not be nominated if there is the potential for actual or perceived conflict of interest with: the student;the supervisory team;the University;subject matter; orwith other members of the Examination panel, including the Convener.\n2. Nomination of Examiners\nThe nomination of examiners is made by the supervisory team and subsequently formally approved by the Head of School or Department. Management of conflicts of interest is primarily the responsibility of the supervisory team, using these guidelines as an initial reference. Any questions or issues related to actual or potential conflicts of interest should be raised with the relevant Dean of Head of Department in the first instance, and discussed with the Dean of the Graduate Research School as appropriate.While there is no presumption that any individual will behave inappropriately, it is not reasonable for potential examiners to make decisions about their suitability to examine (with reference to these or other guidelines). However, it is reasonable to expect examiners to declare conflicts of interest and to note these as appropriate.No conflict of interest exists in situations where a candidate attends a conference organised by a potential examiner, has informal contact with a potential examiner at conferences or workshops etc., or presents papers in a department at which a potential examiner works, or submits papers to a journal edited by a potential examiner.There is a range of circumstances which have the potential to introduce bias and compromise the independence of the examination. In dealing with potential conflicts of interest it is important to: Distinguish between major conflicts (as outlined below) which generally preclude appointment of the examiner, and minor conflicts (as outlined below) which should be declared and explained, but do not necessarily inhibit the examiner\u2019s independence; andConsider disciplinary and/or cultural factors which may arise from smaller departments or small fields/communities of study that might alleviate perceived conflicts of interest (as outlined below)In situations where there is a relatively small community of researchers (e.g., M\u0101ori or Pacifica, or area of expertise), there is a higher likelihood of a personal or professional relationship such as through network associations, research grants or publication outputs. In some instances, there may be a previous supervisory and/or examination relationship between the examiner and candidate or supervisor. In each case there may be mitigating circumstances, and it is the supervisor's responsibility to ensure there is full disclosure of the nature of the relationship to the Dean of the Graduate Research School to consider exceptional cases for approval. This process is essential to ensure the integrity and transparency of the nomination process.There may be challenges in balancing the need to find an independent examiner and the need to find an examiner with focal expertise in the field of the thesis. However, it should be noted that specific expertise within the narrow field of the thesis is not the only (nor necessarily the primary) consideration in selecting a potential examiner. An examiner\u2019s broad knowledge of the particular field of research, experience as a supervisor and as an examiner of research degree candidates, plus their broad familiarity with the expectations of the research degree (and the thesis) are all equally important considerations in the selection and nomination of examiners.\n3. Major Conflicts of Interest\nListed below are examples of different types of major conflicts of interest that may arise between the examiner and various parties including the candidate, the supervisor/advisor, the University, the subject matter itself, and another member of the examination panel (including the Convener).  It should be noted that the following list is only indicative of major conflicts of interest and should not be considered exhaustive.

Minor Conflicts of Interest\nListed below are examples of different types of minor conflicts of interest that may arise between the examiner and various parties including the candidate, the supervisor/advisor, the University, the subject matter itself, and another member of the examination panel (including the Convener). It should be noted that the following list is only indicative of minor conflicts of interest and should notbe considered exhaustive. \nExaminer has had personal contact with the candidate that may give rise to the perception that the examiner may be dealing with the candidate in a less than objective mannerExaminer has a current professional relationship, such as shared membership of a Board or Committee (including editorial and grant decision boards), with the supervisorExaminer has examined for the University three or more times in the past 12 months and/or five or more times in the past five yearsExaminer has received an Honorary Doctorate from the University within the past five yearsExaminer graduated from the University within the past five yearsExaminer is currently working for the University pro bono (for example, on a review)Examiner has a current professional relationship with the University (for example, membership of a Board or Committee)Examiner has a currently Visiting position with the University or has had such a position during the candidature of the candidate or in the past five yearsExaminer has a professional relationship with another examiner"}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Donations_to_the_University_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Donations_to_the_University_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These Guidelines apply University-wide.", "purpose": "These guidelines reflect the fundamental academic principles that shape the University's relationships with donors. \nThe purpose of the University is set out in the University of Otago Charter.

Examples of Genuine Reasons for the University of Otago\nSometimes positions are clearly only available for a fixed period of time, and therefore the employer needs to clearly explain this to potential employees. It is a legal requirement that the employee understands the reason for the fixed term nature of the work he/she is agreeing to and how the employment agreement will end.\nIn the University of Otago context, genuine reasons based on reasonable grounds can be broadly defined as:\n\nAdditional staffing for peak workload periods (including seasonal work)\nProjects of a specific and limited duration (including research projects)\nCovering for staff members on leave\nCovering for staff members undertaking alternative duties\nCovering vacant positions until the recruitment process is complete\nUniversity student development opportunity positions\n\nReasons must be clear, detailed and specific to the employment situation for each fixed term appointment. Please seek advice from your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor on the reasons for fixed term employment, or on whether a position should be fixed term. Listed below are some examples of how genuine fixed term reasons can be applied in different limited duration work situations. The hiring manager can draft a fixed term reason specific to the employment situation using these examples as a guide, or contact Human Resources for assistance. The draft reason is reviewed by Human Resources then used in the letter of offer. The Head of Department/ Manager is responsible for ensuring that the reason provided fits exactly with the situation in each case.\n\na.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Additional staffing for peak workload periods (including seasonal work)\n\nto assist with a (define additional/peak workload e.g. backlog of filing/ university enrolments). Once the majority of the (e.g. enrolments) has been completed, which will be no later than the end date, the University will no longer require additional assistance.\nto teach the (topic name) component of the (course name). The lectures and tutorials will take place in (specific timeframe e.g. the 3rd and 5th weeks of Semester 1). Once the lectures and tutorials have been completed, the University will no longer require additional assistance.\nto provide additional teaching assistance on (course name). This assistance is necessary to meet the needs of an unexpectedly high number of students enrolled in this paper this (Semester/Year).\nto teach, examine and mark the (course name) for the University's Summer School.\nPlease note: Where a peak need situation becomes an ongoing need, it no longer fits the criteria for fixed term employment.\n\n\nb.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Projects of a specific and limited duration (including research projects)\n\nto undertake (define tasks/processes) within the (name of funded research project) project which are required to be completed by the end date in line with the project schedule and funding agreed with (name of funding source).\nto complete the (project name e.g. department website review) project and implement the recommended improvements. The project is to be completed by the end date.\nto undertake (define tasks/processes) of the (project name) project which are scheduled to be completed by the end date in line with the project schedule.\n\nPlease note: \n\n\n\nIt may be useful to attach a copy of the project plan or other relevant documents.\nIf there the work may be completed earlier than the end date provided, you may wish to include an early termination clause such as: \u201cShould the project be ahead of schedule, or the project requirements change, for any reason, the employee may be given one month's notice of termination.\u201d \nIf the employee is likely to undertake work outside the core aspects of the role, you may wish to include a statement such as: \u201cIn order promote collaborative research in this field and to support your academic development, you may be required to support teaching delivery, supervision of postgraduate students, preparation of future grant applications or to contribute to related projects. This does not affect the reason for the position, or the fixed term nature of the employment. \u201d\n\n\nc.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Covering for staff members on leave or reduced hours\n\nto provide cover for the position while the incumbent is on (parental) leave. The incumbent is expected to return from leave by the end date of this agreement. The position will end when the incumbent either returns from (parental) leave or resigns. If that return or resignation date is prior to the end date of this agreement, the employee will be given (one month)'s notice of termination.\nto provide additional staffing made necessary while a staff member is working reduced hours for an agreed period of time. Once the staff member resumes normal hours, which will be by the end date of this agreement, there will be no further need for this support.\nPlease note: Please provide the name of the staff member, the date that has been agreed for the staff member to return to work (or to normal hours), and any other information relevant to the proposed end date of the fixed term appointment. \n\n\nd.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: Covering for staff members undertaking alternative duties\n\nto provide coverage for an academic staff member who would usually lecture in this area and who has been released from teaching and administration duties in order to allocate time during the academic year to focus on (specify as appropriate). The dates for this fixed term agreement are set to allow for sufficient time to prepare for the academic year and to complete end-of-year academic requirements such as marking. Once the academic staff member resumes normal duties, there will be no further need for this support.\nto provide additional staffing made necessary due to a staff member being released from normal duties to undertake additional work required to (specify e.g. complete project). Once this additional work is finished, which will be by the end date of this agreement there is no further need for this support.\nPlease note: Please provide the name of the staff member who has been released from duties; and confirmation that either:\n\n\nthe agreement to release the staff member ends on a date that is consistent with the end date of the fixed term agreement; or\nthe additional work that the staff member is doing ends on a date that is consistent with the end date of the fixed term agreement\n\n\ne. Fixed Term Reason Examples: Covering a vacant position until the recruitment process is complete\n\nto provide cover for the position while the position is advertised and filled. When the successful candidate is appointed, and a handover period has been completed, the position will end. This process is expected to be completed by the end date of this agreement.\nPlease Note: You may wish to include an early termination clause such as: \u201cShould an earlier appointment be made, the employee will be given (one month)'s notice of termination.\u201d\n\n\nto cover a vacant position while the Department undertakes a review of its requirements. The review will be completed by the end date of this agreement, at which time the Department's requirements will be known and, if a position is required, it will be advertised accordingly.\nPlease note: For this type of situation, the Head of Department/Manager must be able to clearly show evidence that the review is planned and has a timeframe that is consistent with the end date of the fixed term agreement. \n\n\nf.\tFixed Term Reason Examples: University Student Development Opportunity Positions\nThe University of Otago has positions which are specifically created to enable University of Otago students to gain practical work experience during, or immediately following, their degree. These include Tutors & Demonstrators, Assistant Lecturers, Residential Assistants, Dental House Surgeons and may include other specific positions as agreed by the Head of Department and Divisional HR Manager.\ni. Tutors & Demonstrators\nto provide an opportunity for students attending the University of Otago to develop their academic knowledge and experience. The function of this position is to provide support for students as a tutor or demonstrator and undertake specific duties associated with the provision of (specify papers) during the academic year. Once the semester is finished there is no further need for this support. The parties agree that it is important that as wide a range of students as possible have this experience, and accordingly the employee's employment will end at the conclusion of the semester without further notice, and the position may be offered to a different student for the following semester. For the same reasons, this Agreement will end earlier, with notice, if the Employee ceases to be a student.\nii.\tResidential Assistants\nto provide an opportunity for students attending the University of Otago to make an important contribution to their College by working with their peers, whilst obtaining some financial assistance with the cost of study. It is an opportunity that with support and training assists students to develop their leadership and organisation skills, further extending the range of educational experience. In so doing students contribute to the special student culture that is distinctive to Otago's tertiary Institutions. The parties agree that it is important that as wide a range of students as possible have this experience, and accordingly the employee's employment will end at the conclusion of the academic year without further notice, and the position may be offered to a different student for the following academic year. For the same reason, the parties agree that this agreement will end earlier, with notice, if the employee ceases to be a student.\niii.\tAssistant Lectureship\nto provide an opportunity for PhD students attending the University of Otago to develop their academic knowledge and experience. The employee will be required to undertake supervised teaching and research duties in addition to their PhD studies. The parties agree that it is important that the Department is able to continue to offer this opportunity to successive post graduate students so that they can have also have the opportunity to gain this experience. Accordingly the employee's employment is fixed term and will end on [e.g. the planned PhD completion date (which is the end date of this agreement)]. For the same reason, the parties agree that this agreement will end earlier, with notice, if the employee ceases to be a student.\niv.\tDental House Surgeons\nto provide the opportunity for recent Otago Dentistry graduates to undertake a dental internship to gain further experience in teaching and clinical experience and to further prepare them for their career, although it does not guarantee that the recipient will be appointed to an academic or clinical position in the future. The parties agree that it is important that this development opportunity is made available to a wide a range of appropriately qualified graduates each year, and accordingly the employee's employment will end at the conclusion of the specified period without further notice, and the position will be offered to a different student in the next intake.\n\ng.\tNote for the preparation of offer letters\n\nThe draft fixed term reason that you provide will be reviewed by Human Resources, and edited in consultation with you as appropriate. Once finalised, the reason will be used within the letter of offer, normally within the following paragraph:\n\u201cThis employment agreement is for a fixed-term commencing {start date} and ending on {end date} without further notice. The reason for the fixed-term is {fixed-term reason}. We do not expect your employment to continue beyond the end of the fixed term because of this reason. Nothing contained or implied in this agreement is intended to create an expectation of an employment relationship continuing beyond the end of the specified term. No express or implied promise of continuing or subsequent employment will be binding on the University unless it is made expressly and in writing.\u201d\nIf the guidelines request that additional information is provided to justify the fixed term reason (for example, the name of the staff member on leave whose position is being covered by the fixed term appointment), please note this information on the recommendation to appoint form (Academic / General). In some cases it may be useful to attach relevant documents (for example, a project plan).\n\n\n3.\tConsiderations in Defining the Fixed Term Reason\na.\tIn defining the fixed term reason, the Head of Department needs to consider:\n\nThe likelihood of the employment ending before the end date specified and an appropriate notice period if this were to occur. Some of the example reasons provided include the arrangements for giving notice to end the employment should it be necessary before the date specified.\nWhether there is more than one reason e.g. \u201cwhere the person will cover 0.3FTE of the Department Administrator's position while she is on reduced hours until 3 December and will provide administrative support to the Project Manager until the project is completed on 5 January\u201d. Where there is more than one reason for ending the position, this must be clearly stated in the agreement.\nWhether the hours of work will vary over the term of the agreement. Where this is likely, the reason should include arrangements for varying hours of work.\nWhether the type of work will vary over the term of the agreement, or where there is an expectation that the employee will undertake work outside the core position. This should be clearly stated to avoid any confusion, and to ensure that the fixed term reason is valid.\nWhether there is a history of fixed term reasons for the position or employee that may create doubt about whether it is reasonable to conclude that the employment will end. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\n\nIt is important to remember that a fixed term employee has no right or claim over any future work, project, fixed term employment or permanent employment. Where the Head of Department's assessment is that a successful candidate for a fixed term position should be employed for any similar work in future, and that similar work is likely to be available in the future, a permanent appointment should be considered. (If the position is research funded, please refer to the Research Funded Permanent Staff Guidelines.)\nPlease seek advice from your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor on the reasons for fixed term employment and on whether a position should be fixed term. This will help minimise any delays in the recruitment process. \nb.\tPotential Employees Who Are Only Available for a Fixed-Term\nThere may be situations where potential employees only want to commit to a position for a set period of time. Please note that this does not change the permanent (or longer term fixed term) nature of the position, nor does it alter the requirement to advertise that position. An offer can include a statement such as:\n\u201cAlthough the position is available on a (a permanent basis/ until date), your employment agreement has an agreed end date of (end date) due to your request and availability. The end date may be reviewed at any time up to (specify e.g. two months) before the end date, on your request.\u201d\n\n4.\tConsiderations in Making a Fixed Term Appointment\na.\tRemuneration and Budget Considerations\nThe University's remuneration policy applies to fixed term staff members. A staff member's remuneration is likely to increase during their employment due to either negotiated increases or salary reviews. The Head of Department is responsible for ensuring that potential salary increases are considered before approving the appointment. The Department is responsible for covering any additional costs. Please seek advice from the Manager, Promotions and Remuneration if you have any queries.\nb.\tAdvertising\nA genuine reason based on reasonable grounds for the fixed term must be provided before a position can be advertised.\nPositions of more than 12 months must be advertised. In exceptional circumstances you can request this be waived. Prepare a memo summarising the case and attach it to the recommendation to appoint form for the approval of the Director of Human Resources. An exceptional circumstance might be where the potential employee is a named Principal Investigator on a successful research grant application.\nFixed term positions of less than 12 months can be advertised as appropriate. A contestable selection process should normally take place, however it is appreciated that, from time to time, there is an immediate need to provide a staffing resource.\nImportant Note: Close relatives and close friends of staff members in the Department or Section concerned cannot be considered for appointments that have not been advertised. If a close relative or friend of a staff member is being considered, the staff member currently in the employ of the University should not justify the need for the appointment, select the appointee, or directly supervise them. Please refer to the University's Ethical Behaviour Policy or contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for assistance.\nc.\tAcceptance\nA signed acceptance will be required from the employee, which will include a declaration that they understand the reason for the fixed term agreement and how their agreement will end, prior to commencing work. Employees must not start work before signing their fixed term agreement.\nApproving named individuals on grant applications\nWhere an individual who is not a current permanent employee of the University is named on an application for a research grant, and the grant is successful, the individual is likely to have an expectation of employment with the University at the remuneration level specified in the grant. Therefore, when approving grant applications, the Head of Department, Dean and Divisional Head must:\n\nEnsure that it would not be practicable to advertise to enable suitably qualified persons to apply for the position.\nEnsure that the individual is suitable for employment at the University of Otago. This includes appropriate employment reference checking.\nEnsure that the proposed level of appointment and remuneration are consistent with University policies and maintain relativities in the Department, School and Division.\n\n\n5.\tWhat Happens if Changes to a Fixed Term Appointment are Necessary?\nIn any employment agreement, the University of Otago normally commits to set hours of work, remuneration and the end date. However, change is sometimes necessary. If you need to change the employment agreement, the change could be negotiated and agreed with the staff member or, in some cases, the management of change process may be required. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\na.\tExtension\nIf the progress of the work is not as expected, it may become necessary to extend the period of employment to enable the work of the original fixed term position to be completed. The nature of the employment and the reason for the employment ending must be the same as the original fixed term agreement, and the reason for the extension justified. Short extensions may be used up to a maximum of 3 months beyond the original fixed term end date. Extensions can be requested by memo. Human Resources will send formal advice of variation to the staff member.\nAn extension cannot be used if new or different work is available for a fixed term, and a current fixed term employee would be able to do this work. Nor can an extension be used if similar work is available for a new period of time and then ending for a different reason. Continued employment cannot be achieved by extending or changing the current fixed term employment in these situations. A new fixed term position would be created and the Head of Department would need to consider an appropriate advertising and selection process before appointing to that position. This new appointment would be requested using normal process.\nThe Head of Department must ensure that any extensions or new offers are agreed in writing before the end of the current fixed term employment. No employee should continue to work beyond the end date of their fixed term agreement.\nb.\tHours of Work\nIf the progress of the work is such that it is necessary to increase, decrease or change the hours of work, and an agreement with the staff member is reached, the University's change of hours form should be completed, approved by both parties and sent to Human Resources for processing. Otherwise, please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\nc.\tNature of Work\nIf the requirements change during the fixed term agreement, there must be documented variation to the employment agreement, or a new fixed term agreement. This could occur if a project does not go as planned, if the work is completed earlier than planned, or if there is an urgent need for their skills in another area. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\nd.\tEarly End of Employment\nA need to end the employment early could occur if a project does not go as planned, if a key staff member leaves and the University is unable to continue the work, or if the work is completed earlier than planned. The ability to end a fixed term agreement early depends on the wording of the agreement. Please contact your Divisional HR Manager or Advisor for advice.\n\nAppendix 1: Fixed Term Employment and New Zealand Employment Legislation\nThe Employment Relations Act 2000 (section 66), requires that a fixed term Employment Agreement must be for \u201cgenuine reasons based on reasonable grounds\u201d, that the employee must agree to those reasons and that those reasons and the way the Employment Agreement will end be recorded in writing as part of every fixed term Employment Agreement.

If a member of your team is transitioning\nIf one of your staff members has disclosed that they are transitioning (or intend to transition in the future) your responsibility as their manager (and the employer's representative) is to support their transitioning at work. This includes addressing any issues that could affect the workplace. You may be asked to assist with communication to staff, clients or students.The concept of gender transitioning might be new to you, so please take appropriate steps to educate yourself about gender transitioning and what it means to be transgender: Allow the staff member to tell you about their individual experience.Refer to the External Resources section at the end of this guide for some recommended reading.Contact the Equity Office who can organise one-on-one training with the OUSA Queer Support Co-ordinator.The aim is to create an environment of support and respect and to prevent and/or appropriately deal with any issues. Many people have had a little or no experience with trans people. Lead by example to set the correct tone in the workplace. Be respectful, avoid making assumptions about the person, create a comfortable atmosphere, use the correct names and pronouns, and advise colleagues about using the correct names and pronouns.The staff member is encouraged to organise a meeting with their manager (you) to discuss their transition at work plan (please see Section 4 for what a transition plan can contain). Please ensure the staff member is aware they can be accompanied by a support person, union representative, wh\u0101nau member, HR or Equity representative during this meeting.Maintaining confidentiality is critical, so avoid disclosing your staff member's transgender status prematurely and without permission. Be open-minded and demonstrate understanding. The transition plan will help you to determine how best to communicate the staff member's transition to their colleagues, clients and/or students.You should not ask the staff member to provide you with a Medical Certificate, or any other similar documentation about their transitioning, unless it is required under the Sick Leave Policy.\n3. Meeting your legal and University obligations\nThe Human Rights Act 1993 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sex. This includes a prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender and gender transitioning. The same prohibition is also in the Employment Relations Act 2000. Discrimination applies to almost all aspects of employment including job advertising, career progression and remuneration. It also applies to unpaid workers and independent contractors.Both employers and employees are obliged to exercise a duty of good faith, which includes being responsive and communicative and actively dealing with any issues that affect their employment relationship.All employees have the right to express their gender without fear of consequences. The University expects students and staff to display ethical behaviour at all times, to all members of its community. Breaches of ethical behaviour include discrimination on the grounds of gender transitioning and personal harassment and bullying. Refer to the University's Ethical Behaviour Policy.The University's core values encompass \u201crespecting and valuing others\u201d, \u201cequity in employment\u201d and \u201csupport for full and equal participation and outcomes for all groups in society\u201d. Refer to the University of Otago Strategic Direction to 2020.\n4. Developing a transitioning at work plan\nAs indicated previously in these guidelines, developing a 'transitioning at work plan' is a good first step in working through the process of transitioning while employed at the University. Below is a list of suggested topics that you might consider addressing in your plan.Communication: Who is going to be informed? For example colleagues, clients, students, collaborators.How they are going to be informed? For example by email or at a meeting. Will there be one announcement, or several?What information is going to be disclosed? This needs to be very clearly agreed to by the transitioning staff member.What information is to be kept confidential? This could be to just the staff member, or just the staff member and the manager.Who is going to make the announcement? For example the staff member, their manager, their HR representative.When will any announcement take place and how will it be phrased? The person who is transitioning must always be consulted before an announcement is made.How does the staff member want to manage any ongoing communication? For example, at different stages of their transition, or in relation to different work tasks/cycles (e.g. at the commencement of each semester)?Timeframes. It would be useful to document the dates or timeframes around when the staff member will: Assume their gender at work (e.g. be known by their new name, referred to by new pronouns, etc.)Adopt a workplace dress code to match their genderStart to use facilities such as restrooms and changing rooms which match their genderNeed to take time off work for medical treatments relating to their transition, if necessary, or to attend to any other matters directly associated with their transition.University Records that will need to be updated (see Section 5).Any other matters that need addressing, such as additional support required by the staff member and/or immediate team members.\n5. Updating University records\nAt the appropriate time during a staff member's transition, they are encouraged to update relevant University records. This section provides details on how to do so. (Note that this relates to staff records only. Students should seek advice from OUSA Queer Support.)Guide to updating University records for LGBTTIQA+ staff and students (PDF)Gender, Title and Preferred Name can be changed at any time (and without any evidence) by contacting Payroll Services. Gender options are Female, Male, Gender Diverse.Your Legal Name can be changed through Payroll Services by completing an IR330 form, and supplying evidence of your legal name change. You can download the IR330 form on the How to update your details webpage. Name in the University HR records will have to match your legal name in certain situations (e.g. when applying for an ACC payment due to work related accident). When you update your name in the HR system other university systems might get updated automatically (e.g. Ask IT or Library systems).You can apply for a new University ID card if it doesn't show the correct name/title or photo. Please find out how to apply for a new ID card.To update other places such as email address, University webpages where your name and/or photo appears \u2013 contact Information Technology Services with any email-related enquiries and Web Experience with any webpage enquiries."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_for_Alternative_Arrangements_for_Internal_Assessment_including_Tests_and_Examinations_for_Students_with_Disabilities_or_Impairments", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_for_Alternative_Arrangements_for_Internal_Assessment_including_Tests_and_Examinations_for_Students_with_Disabilities_or_Impairments.html", "scope": "University-wide, excluding the MB ChB programme, which has its own procedures.", "purpose": "Alternative Arrangements for Tests (such as Terms Tests) and Internal Examinations are designed to assist students with impairments who may experience difficulty sitting tests under conventional circumstances, in order to provide for them an equitable opportunity to participate and achieve. \nCourse Co-ordinators are required to provide their students with information on the nature and timing of any terms tests or internal examinations for their papers.

A brief, provisional description of processes/outputs potentially to be submitted for examination (e.g., performance, exhibition, design, novel, film, carving etc) should be identified, and an indication should be given of resources anticipated to be required for the research. A conceptual framework for the praxis should also be outlined. If the project is to involve any collaboration with other artists, it is important to detail the role of the candidate and the roles and nature of any contribution being made by others.PhD research is concerned with the production of epistemic insights (\u201cnew knowledge\u201d). Creative practices may not in themselves constitute research, regardless of aesthetic excellence or critical reception. In a PhD with Practice, candidates are required to undertake an investigative inquiry that leads to substantial new insights, effectively shared. The submission of a practice for examination must be accompanied by the submission of \u201ccomplementary writings\u201d (exegesis) which located the practice in a conceptual framework and a lineage (practice review). Together, the practice and complementary writings (exegesis) constitute \u201cthe thesis\u201d, evidencing the research inquiry and its findings and, accordingly, the written component is shorter than that required of an ordinary thesis (typically, c. 30,000 \u2013 40,000 words).From the perspective of te reo M\u0101ori practitioners and researchers, intellectual rigour can be measured through the conveyance of knowledge in oral and written forms of te reo M\u0101ori. Various oral art forms, such as karanga, whaik\u014drero, waiata and haka, are means through which expertise in m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori can be delivered in te reo M\u0101ori and consequently assessed for its validity and strength of an argument. Such a M\u0101ori centred practice component might form a significant component of a PhD.Note: please consult the relevant academic unit for further guidance on using a M\u0101ori centred practice component for a PhD with Practice Research.Only in exceptional circumstances would candidates registered for a PhD by thesis be permitted to change their registration to PhD with Practice.Prior training and experience PhD with Practice Research applicants will be required to demonstrate expertise, advanced training and/or professional experience in the discipline(s) involved in their proposal. Advanced training may be understood as a postgraduate degree or diploma; professional experience may be understood as at least two years of employment and/or professional productivity in the relevant field(s); expertise in M\u0101ori oral art forms is demonstrated by the practice of such oral forms over an extended period of time, and by the acknowledgement of such expertise by others (in the M\u0101ori world it is for other people to speak of someone\u2019s knowledge and expertise).Supervisor selection In addition to the University of Otago requirement that a primary supervisor will hold a PhD or have equivalent academic status, for PhD with Practice Research at least one of the supervisors will have relevant experience or standing in the field of practice or practice research.Quality of PracticeSince the primary criterion, as for any PhD, is a significant contribution to new knowledge or epistemic innovation in the area of practice, the quality of the practice, and its documentation, must be sufficient to the purpose. Any claim to the originality of the practice per se must be demonstrable either, in itself, or through explication of process and location in a lineage in the complementary writings.Exegesis (typically 30,000 \u2013 40,000 words, maximum 50,000 words)The exegesis is required to do more than merely describe the practice (process/product). Though findings may be manifest in the practice itself, they may not be self-evident to the viewer or the examiner on first view. Hence, it is necessary to accompany submission of a practice with a document that serves additionally to make the insights explicit. This exegesis outlines the methodology (Practice Research; Practice as Research; Artistic Research; Practice-led Research) and documents the process of investigation with critical reflection on it. It presents the conceptual framework and context of the project, including articulating and evidencing a research inquiry.An exegesis may typically be comprised of: Introduction \u2013 outlining the project, its origins and questions, contribution to knowledge and significance to the field/s; details of any contributions to the creative work made by collaborators.Methodology \u2013 articulation of the research methodology and methods and materials being utilised.Context/Conceptual Framework \u2013 a section on the context of the practice, including such matters as physical, traditional Indigenous, historical, artistic contexts as well as conceptual frameworks for the project.Location in a Lineage \u2013 a review of similar practices facilitates the identification of what is new about the submitted practice.Documentation of Process and Analysis \u2013 a detailed discussion of the project, closely analysing and reflecting upon how the project was conducted and how the different elements were drawn together in the project and to what effect, attributing, where required, the contribution of any collaborators.Conclusion \u2013 elucidating the new insights, recounting the findings and future research directions.Bibliography or references.Confirmation of CandidatureConfirmation of nominated practice research At the progress meeting considering confirmation, candidates must confirm their wish to pursue PhD with Practice Research and seek confirmatory approval from the Academic Head (HoD), and the Graduate Research Committee. Confirmation will require demonstration of satisfactory progression in all aspects of the inquiry.Content of review In addition to the normal expectations during the provisional period for a PhD candidate, it is expected that a candidate intending to present a practice will have: clarified the intended examinable format of the practice (as discussed in the examination guidelines below) within their completed research proposal;completed a draft of the methodology section of the exegesis, outlining how the investigative inquiry will lead to substantial new insights from their process/practice in a PhD research context.Criteria for progression The decision of the Academic Head (HoD) and the Graduate Research Committee to approve a PhD candidate\u2019s suitability for a PhD by Practice submission at, or following, a progress meeting will be informed by: the candidate's demonstrated ability to engage in a PhD with Practice Research;the candidate\u2019s progress within their provisional year; andthe Academic Unit\u2019s capacity to provide resources for the research, supervision and examination processes required by the candidate\u2019s research proposal.Submission and ExaminationSubmission formats Candidates for PhD with Practice Research will normally present in one or more of the following three formats: as printed material integrated into the bound exegesis document;as a digital recording in a portable format bound into the front of the exegesis document;as a live performance or exhibition (to be documented and included in the exegesis document).Examination Under standard PhD regulations, the thesis (practice and exegesis) will be examined as an integrated body of work in respect of its substantial new insights. The examiners may require minor amendments to the thesis, or may require the thesis to be revised and resubmitted. In making their determination, the examiners of a PhD with Practice Research may require amendments to either the practice and/or exegesis submission.Where amendments or re-examination is required for a PhD which includes a live performed practice or exhibition, the Convener of Examiners must be consulted to determine the feasibility of restaging the live performance or exhibition for examiners. Where this is deemed not possible, examiners will be referred to audiovisual documentation of the resubmitted performance or exhibition. See also the Regulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).Examination of live performance/exhibition Where the practice involves live performance or an exhibition, examiners should normally experience the work \u201clive\u201d and also be given access to any video recording of the event/s. While the research process might incorporate (and make reference to) several performances or exhibitions, only one live performance/exhibition can require the attendance of the doctoral examiners. The costs associated with bringing examiners to such an event (if separate from the oral examination visit) will be borne by the Academic Unit in which the student is enrolled. The event should be considered as independent of, though possibly temporally adjacent to, the oral examination. It is expected that the normal protocols determining that examiners do not confer on the candidate\u2019s work would be observed at any such event. It is expected that the submission of examiners\u2019 reports, the oral examination and the recommendation of the Convener of Examiners will otherwise follow the normal schedules and protocols for PhD examinations (not be guided by the timing of examiners viewing of practice at live events).Attribution It is the candidate's responsibility to attribute correctly the contributions to creative work made by collaborators. This attribution should include commentary in the introduction of the thesis (and elsewhere as appropriate) regarding the nature of any collaboration and the respective roles of the candidate and any collaborators (in this work).Copyright It will also be candidate\u2019s responsible to obtain any necessary third-party copyright or performers\u2019 permissions for: any subsequent public dissemination of recordings;presentation on any publicly-accessible digital archive. This permission should be obtained through media release forms or other relevant contracts.Documentation All productions, indigenous practices or exhibitions being presented for examination must also be recorded (and documented). It will be the candidate\u2019s responsible to organise such recordings in liaison with the school, programme or department where appropriate.If a live production or exhibition is presented for examination as a digital recording, the candidate is expected to articulate their role in the digital recording and editing process within their written thesis. The digital recording should also be at least 4K definition or a similar high standard.The candidate will be expected to gain the permission of any co-producers of the digital recording of the work.", "content": "Admission Expression of intent PhD with Practice Research applicants should indicate their wish to use a Practice Research methodology in their initial research proposal prior to admission into the University of Otago PhD programme.

It presents the conceptual framework and context of the project, including articulating and evidencing a research inquiry.An exegesis may typically be comprised of: Introduction \u2013 outlining the project, its origins and questions, contribution to knowledge and significance to the field/s; details of any contributions to the creative work made by collaborators.Methodology \u2013 articulation of the research methodology and methods and materials being utilised.Context/Conceptual Framework \u2013 a section on the context of the practice, including such matters as physical, traditional Indigenous, historical, artistic contexts as well as conceptual frameworks for the project.Location in a Lineage \u2013 a review of similar practices facilitates the identification of what is new about the submitted practice.Documentation of Process and Analysis \u2013 a detailed discussion of the project, closely analysing and reflecting upon how the project was conducted and how the different elements were drawn together in the project and to what effect, attributing, where required, the contribution of any collaborators.Conclusion \u2013 elucidating the new insights, recounting the findings and future research directions.Bibliography or references.Confirmation of CandidatureConfirmation of nominated practice research At the progress meeting considering confirmation, candidates must confirm their wish to pursue PhD with Practice Research and seek confirmatory approval from the Academic Head (HoD), and the Graduate Research Committee. Confirmation will require demonstration of satisfactory progression in all aspects of the inquiry.Content of review In addition to the normal expectations during the provisional period for a PhD candidate, it is expected that a candidate intending to present a practice will have: clarified the intended examinable format of the practice (as discussed in the examination guidelines below) within their completed research proposal;completed a draft of the methodology section of the exegesis, outlining how the investigative inquiry will lead to substantial new insights from their process/practice in a PhD research context.Criteria for progression The decision of the Academic Head (HoD) and the Graduate Research Committee to approve a PhD candidate\u2019s suitability for a PhD by Practice submission at, or following, a progress meeting will be informed by: the candidate's demonstrated ability to engage in a PhD with Practice Research;the candidate\u2019s progress within their provisional year; andthe Academic Unit\u2019s capacity to provide resources for the research, supervision and examination processes required by the candidate\u2019s research proposal.Submission and ExaminationSubmission formats Candidates for PhD with Practice Research will normally present in one or more of the following three formats: as printed material integrated into the bound exegesis document;as a digital recording in a portable format bound into the front of the exegesis document;as a live performance or exhibition (to be documented and included in the exegesis document).Examination Under standard PhD regulations, the thesis (practice and exegesis) will be examined as an integrated body of work in respect of its substantial new insights. The examiners may require minor amendments to the thesis, or may require the thesis to be revised and resubmitted. In making their determination, the examiners of a PhD with Practice Research may require amendments to either the practice and/or exegesis submission.Where amendments or re-examination is required for a PhD which includes a live performed practice or exhibition, the Convener of Examiners must be consulted to determine the feasibility of restaging the live performance or exhibition for examiners. Where this is deemed not possible, examiners will be referred to audiovisual documentation of the resubmitted performance or exhibition. See also the Regulations for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).Examination of live performance/exhibition Where the practice involves live performance or an exhibition, examiners should normally experience the work \u201clive\u201d and also be given access to any video recording of the event/s. While the research process might incorporate (and make reference to) several performances or exhibitions, only one live performance/exhibition can require the attendance of the doctoral examiners. The costs associated with bringing examiners to such an event (if separate from the oral examination visit) will be borne by the Academic Unit in which the student is enrolled. The event should be considered as independent of, though possibly temporally adjacent to, the oral examination. It is expected that the normal protocols determining that examiners do not confer on the candidate\u2019s work would be observed at any such event. It is expected that the submission of examiners\u2019 reports, the oral examination and the recommendation of the Convener of Examiners will otherwise follow the normal schedules and protocols for PhD examinations (not be guided by the timing of examiners viewing of practice at live events).Attribution It is the candidate's responsibility to attribute correctly the contributions to creative work made by collaborators. This attribution should include commentary in the introduction of the thesis (and elsewhere as appropriate) regarding the nature of any collaboration and the respective roles of the candidate and any collaborators (in this work).Copyright It will also be candidate\u2019s responsible to obtain any necessary third-party copyright or performers\u2019 permissions for: any subsequent public dissemination of recordings;presentation on any publicly-accessible digital archive. This permission should be obtained through media release forms or other relevant contracts.Documentation All productions, indigenous practices or exhibitions being presented for examination must also be recorded (and documented). It will be the candidate\u2019s responsible to organise such recordings in liaison with the school, programme or department where appropriate.If a live production or exhibition is presented for examination as a digital recording, the candidate is expected to articulate their role in the digital recording and editing process within their written thesis. The digital recording should also be at least 4K definition or a similar high standard.The candidate will be expected to gain the permission of any co-producers of the digital recording of the work."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_for_Email_Communications", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_for_Email_Communications.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all staff employed by the University, and all Approved Persons who are approved to send or receive email communications on behalf of the University.", "purpose": "The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure effective and appropriate use of email communications for University purposes. \nSending and respondingThe University acknowledges that the use of email can increase pressure on workplaces through the large number of emails sent to some staff and the desire for an immediate reply.

Expectations\nSupervisor-candidate expectations should be discussed early in candidature and a formalised agreement is recommended (a student-supervisor agreement is mandatory for PhD candidates). Expectations/agreements should be reviewed from time to time to ensure currency and relevance.Academic, supervisory and other issues that may affect progress should be talked through candidly and constructively by supervisors and candidates; this particularly applies in the early phases of work.The supervisory relationship should be an open, honest and professional interaction between candidate and supervisors, based on mutual respect, trust and good-will.The supervisory arrangement should be viewed as an evolving partnership, in which an initial candidate/supervisor relationship develops towards increasing equality as the project reaches its culmination in the production of the thesis.Supervisors and candidates should adhere to the Ethical Behaviour Policy.Supervisors and candidates should adhere to the Intellectual Property Rights of Graduate Research Students Policy.Staff should be aware of the potential for conflict of interest in a supervisory relationship and should familiarise themselves with the relevant sections of the Ethical Behaviour Policy and Conflicts of Interest Policy.Supervisors and candidates should discuss the use of data and findings from thesis research to clarify who has access, and how data might be shared and stored.Prior to embarking on publishing of graduate research results, supervisors and candidates should discuss authorship credit and author order. For example, the Vancouver Protocol could be followed.Supervisors are encouraged to complete checklists regarding admission, candidature, and submission requirements: Sample checklist for supervisors of doctoral candidates (DOC)Sample checklist for supervisors of master's thesis candidates (DOCX)\n3. Collegiality\nThe supervisor should: assist in integrating the candidate into the academic and social life of the departmentprovide a collaborative research environment and encourage open communicationensure that meetings with co-supervisors and/or departmental advisory committees operate in a constructive manner, andbe sensitive to cultural, political, gender or religious issues relating to the research topic or the candidate.\n4. Academic advice\nThe supervisor should: hold regular formal supervision meetings - usually at least fortnightlybe available, within reason, at other times to provide assistance when particular difficulties ariseencourage the candidate to adopt an independent approach to learningensure that the candidate is involved in setting the timetable for the research and reviewing progress of the researchprovide full, prompt, honest and informative feedback in a timely manner (usually within three weeks) to the candidate on work in progressremain conversant with the issues and the literature relating to the candidate's researchprovide reliable and well-informed guidance in all matters of sound research practice, andaccept that, in some aspects of the topic at least, the candidate's level of knowledge might eventually exceed that of the supervisor.\n5. Practical support\nThe supervisor should: discuss and ensure the candidate is aware of aspects of their research that require approval, such as: EthicsM\u0101ori consultationOverseas researchbe prepared to give advice on sources of financial support, or direct the candidate to those who can provide such adviceensure that the candidate is properly forewarned if the supervisor is to be absent from the University for more than a brief period (for the purposes of research and study leave, for example), andarrange, through the Head of Department, for adequate alternative supervision during any period of absence, either by assigning another staff member to take over supervision or by setting up other means of communication (by email or Zoom, for example).\n6. Support for the candidate's professional development\nThe supervisor should: discuss further educational and/or employment pathways with the candidatediscuss professional development needs with the candidateencourage the candidate to become an active member of the professional community, national and internationalfor doctoral candidates, ensure that the candidate has opportunities to contribute to research seminars within the departmentfor doctoral candidates, encourage the candidate to attend relevant conferences within New Zealand and overseas and offer guidance in the preparation of conference presentationsidentify work by the candidate suitable for publication in refereed journals or other academic publications and assist in the preparation of articles for submissionmake clear from the outset how issues relating to joint publication of work arising from the candidate's thesis are to be handled, andnot expect the candidate to work in the capacity of \u201ctechnician\u201d or \u201csecretary\u201d to the supervisor.\n7. Supervisor professional development\nNew supervisors are required to attend professional development workshops on supervision during their confirmation period, and preferably prior to taking on any supervision.All supervisors are encouraged to participate in the professional development programme for supervisors.Experienced supervisors are expected to take an active mentoring role when co-supervising with inexperienced supervisors \u2013 particularly those who have not supervised a candidate to completion."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_for_Jointly_Taught_or_Jointly_Supervised_Postgraduate_Degrees", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_for_Jointly_Taught_or_Jointly_Supervised_Postgraduate_Degrees.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to graduate research degrees (doctoral and masters') as well as coursework masters' degrees.", "purpose": "To outline the processes governing postgraduate degree programmes that are jointly taught or supervised through collaboration with a designated New Zealand or international partner university and lead to one degree.

Eligibility\nApproval for jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programmes will only be given for cases where it can be clearly established that a strong collaborative link with the partner institution(s) already exists or is actively being developed.Prospective candidates must satisfy the usual criteria for entry to the University of Otago postgraduate programme, and must apply for admission in the usual way.\u00a0\u00a0Both international and domestic candidates are eligible to participate in the jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programmes.\n4. Funding\nFor candidates whose lead institution is the University of Otago: Candidates must enrol and pay tuition fees at the University of Otago for each year of their study, even if they are studying at a partner institution in a given year.Candidates may be enrolled for a degree or under another enrolment status at partner institutions, and may be charged administrative and/or tuition fees by those institutions. If the partner institution is a New Zealand institution, the candidate cannot be formally enrolled at the partner institution.International and domestic candidates can stay up to half-time at a partner institution, but see (iv).To be eligible for PhD domestic fees at the University of Otago, international candidates, New Zealand permanent residents and Australian citizens intending to study overseas must spend no more than one year at the international partner institution, and only for research-related reasons (i.e. research activities they cannot conduct in New Zealand).Both international and domestic candidates will be able to apply for postgraduate scholarship support through the University of Otago.The University of Otago receives Student Achievement Component funding and PBRF completion funding.For candidates whose partner institution is the University of Otago: Candidates will enrol for a Certificate of Proficiency, and be recorded in the University's Visiting Student System (\u201cSojourn\u201d).Candidates may be charged administrative fees (if applicable) as well as tuition fees.Candidates are not eligible for postgraduate scholarship support through the University of Otago.International candidates will be covered by the Code of Practice for the Pastoral Care of International StudentsThe University of Otago will not receive any Student Achievement Component funding for international candidates.The University of Otago will not receive any PBRF completion funding.\n5. Enrolment, administration and examination\nCandidates wishing to be enrolled at the University of Otago in a jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme must apply for candidature in the normal way and will be enrolled in the relevant course code.Candidates' programmes of study will be administered in accordance with the University of Otago regulations governing the particular programme and any specific arrangements laid out in the candidature agreement.The examination arrangements must meet the University of Otago requirements, and the candidature agreement should cover any additional requirements the partner institutions may have and ensure that the procedures for examination are clearly understood by all parties including the individual candidate.\n6. Graduation and degree certificate\nCandidates graduating from a jointly-taught or jointly-supervised postgraduate degree programme are only allowed to attend graduation at the lead institution and may only receive one award certificate from the lead institution. The student transcript there may contain a statement saying that this degree was taught in conjunction with the partner institution.Providing notification to the Graduation Office, any supervisor(s) from the partner university can attend the graduation ceremony as part of the academic staff.\n7. Application process\nHeads of Department/Schools are encouraged to informally discuss proposals with the Dean of the Graduate Research School. Given that the main requirement for approval of these programmes is that they serve to form a viable and desirable link, it is best to seek advice from the Dean of the Graduate Research School and the Director of International (if for an international partnership) as to the viability of the proposal prior to approaching another institution. Following these informal discussions, if the partnership looks viable, a formal application may be lodged.For partnerships with overseas institutions, the formal application must include: a proposal to establish a partnership (unless this is already existing);a copy of the MOU between the institutions; and,a candidature agreement.For partnerships with New Zealand institutions: a candidature agreement."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_for_Postgraduate_Students_Travelling_Overseas_for_Research", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_for_Postgraduate_Students_Travelling_Overseas_for_Research.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all postgraduate students who travel overseas for research-related purposes.

Ensuring necessary travel documentation is obtained\nThe student should have a passport which is valid for more than six months after they return to New Zealand.The necessary visas should have been obtained for the research.Any access agreements to land/buildings/spaces must be obtained prior to data collection.The relevant authorities in the host country should be informed of the study and researchers should comply with any local requirements, for example, research permit, ethical review, research sponsor, etc.\n3. Consideration of travel safety issues\nIn the Postgraduate Travel Overseas Research and Safety Plan, possible risks should be identified and categorised, and the steps being taken to mitigate them outlined. These should include risks in the fieldwork as well as risks associated with accommodation and food.Where relevant, details should be provided of any safety equipment that is to be taken into the field.Students should be aware that they always retain the right to withdraw from all or part of any fieldwork activity, without question, when they consider their physical, emotional and/or cultural safety may be compromised.\n4. Contact details\nIn the Plan, details should be provided for how often and by what means (e.g., email, telephone, Skype or face-to-face meetings) the student will make contact with their supervisor and/or departmentEmergency contact information for the student must be entered.Contact details for any local support should be given\n5. Consideration of medical issues\nAny relevant existing medical conditions should be outlined in the Plan, together with how travel/fieldwork might impact on them and how these will be managed.If appropriate, students are advised to consult Student Health or their personal doctor at least two months before travelling to check on appropriate medications or inoculations.Any recommended immunisations should be detailed, together with commentary regarding whether they will or will not be obtained (and if the latter why not). Note that the immunisations will not normally be paid for by the University.\n6. Ensuring travel insurance is obtained\nThe level of risk for the travel both in terms of safety and medical reasons must be ascertained prior to departure: For travel to a high risk country, permission is required from the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor. The application should include the security advice recommended by ISOS , together with an explanation of how those risks will be mitigated.For travel to an extreme risk country the approval of the Vice-Chancellor is required.It is mandatory for students to have insurance when travelling overseas on University business (including research activities). Where students' activities are covered by a University grant, the grant is to be used to meet the insurance costs. Three options are available: Corporate Travel Insurance PolicyStudentsafe OutboundUnder some specific circumstances, international students who are insured under Studentsafe Inbound University may have limited cover while undertaking short-term study or research activities in Australia, Bali, Lombok, the Islands of the South Pacific, or in their country of origin.

Principles\nAssessment of student performance at the University of Otago follows four principles: Assessments will centre on essential knowledge and skills.Assessment will be criterion-referenced; each student's work will be judged on its own merits with grades awarded on the basis of demonstrated achievement against established learning outcomes and standards.All internal assessment will have a formative component and inform learning.The workload associated with assessment requirements will be reasonable and the tasks will be fully described at the start of the paper to give students time to fit them in alongside their other commitments.\n2. Assessment Arrangements\nMost University papers will include a mix of internal assessment(s) and a final examination, but this pattern may be varied as appropriate to the learning outcomes of the paper (see also clause 4).Every University paper should include sufficient formative assessment to provide students with feedback to inform their learning.In each paper, students should receive specific, clear, and early information about what they need to do to pass the paper or to obtain a grade. The information should include details about the assessment criteria, format, timing, percentage weight and focus of each assessment, and should be available in the paper outline, on the learning management site and/or in other documents made available at the start of the paper. A summary of assessment should also be available to students considering enrolling in the paper, for example via a list of assessment tasks with percentage weightings in the paper supplementary information on the University website.Where an internal assessment test is held outside the scheduled meeting times for a paper (for instance, a single evening test for two or more lecture streams), the date, starting time and duration of the test should be announced at the first class and in the paper outline.Internally assessed work should not normally be due between the start of the last teaching week and the first day of examinations (except for a low-weight laboratory report from the previous week being submitted early in the last teaching week).If a paper has no final examination and all summative graded assessment is internal, then it may be reasonable for students to hand in the final assessment during the last week of teaching. It is recommended that, in these circumstances, an assessment task be worth less than 20% of the final grade, though that may be higher in postgraduate papers (e.g., where the final assignment is a culmination of the learning objectives, for example in the case of a research proposal).If a paper has no final examination, an internal assessment task may be submitted at any time during the examination period but with a deadline of the last day of examinations. Any final assessment must be marked and available to students before the deadline for confirming examination results for the relevant semester.Announced assessment arrangements in each paper may be changed only after consultation with students and approval by the Head of Department.Where changes to assessment arrangements impact a paper such that the content changes by 25% or more, a new paper proposal is required and should be submitted to the Board of Graduate Studies or Board of Undergraduate Studies as appropriate. Significant changes to assessment arrangements that do not require a new paper proposal should be notified to the Head of Department and then to the relevant Divisional Academic Board.Procedures for Student Assessment in Te Reo M\u0101ori Refer to M\u0101ori Language Policy \u2013 Ng\u0101 Kaupapa m\u014d te reo M\u0101ori\n3. Penalties for Late Submitted Assignment\nUsing a late submission penalty is at the discretion of the paper convenor. Where used, information setting out the use of a late submission penalty must be included in the paper material provided to students.Where a late submission penalty is used, the standard penalty shall be 5% of the maximum mark per day late or part thereof. For example, if submitted up to 24 hours late, reduce available marks by 5%; 24-48 hours late, reduce available marks by 10% etc. Examples applying this Schedule include: An assignment is marked as 17/20 (20 marks being the maximum available marks). If this was submitted one day late, this mark is reduced by 5% of 20 (-.05 x 20 = -1), meaning that the final awarded mark is 16/20; if submitted two days late, the final awarded mark is 15/20 (-.10 x 20 = -2); if submitted three days late, the final awarded mark is 14/20 (-.15 x 20 = -3) etc.An assignment is marked as 25/40 (40 marks being the maximum available marks). If this was submitted one day late, this mark is reduced by 5% of 40 (-.05 x 40 = -2), meaning that the final awarded mark is 23/40; if submitted two dates late, the final awarded mark is 21/40 (-.10 x 40 = -4); if submitted three days late, the final assigned mark is 19/40 (-.15 x 40 = -6) etc. Penalty calculatorAll penalty timeframes are inclusive of weekends, public holidays, and university semester breaks and closure timesLate submitted assignments, without prior approved extensions, will not be accepted after the feedback on the assessment task has been returned to any student by the marker. Timeframes for returning marks should be provided to students in the course outline.Assignments submitted after seven days of the deadline, or after feedback is returned if this is less than seven days, also will not be marked.Requests for time extensions should normally be applied for prospectively (before the submission deadline), unless there are mitigating circumstances preventing that request being made (e.g., unable to submit the request due to hospital admission, sickness etc). Information regarding the extensions process should be included in the course outline. Approving retrospective extensions is at the discretion of the marker.\n4. Emphasis Given to the University Graduate Profile\nAssessment tasks should be aligned with the relevant graduate attributes in the University Graduate Profile.Assessment in all papers should give substantial weight to deeper learning (the development of conceptual understanding and skills in applying knowledge to new situations), while not neglecting to give credit for learning core factual material.In addition to short-term goals, assessment in all papers should give explicit emphasis to long-term goals such as synthesis of knowledge and the development of written and oral communication skills, research skills and thinking skills, thus better equipping graduates for lifelong learning.\n5. Relative Weights Given to Summative Internal Assessments and Final Examinations\nThe weights given to different summative assessment components included in final grades should reflect the stated learning outcomes of the paper. This is the central requirement for validity of the grades.The proportion of marks awarded through internal summative assessment should be in accord with the previous guideline 4(a). Given the diverse goals and teaching arrangements of different papers, this proportion can be expected to vary widely (up to and including one hundred percent summative internal assessment).Adjustment of internal summative assessment marks through the use of 'plussage' procedures may be appropriate for some assessment components in some papers. These components should be clearly identified in paper outlines.Only where good academic reasons exist should a specified level of result in the final examination be required to pass a paper. Students must be informed in the paper outline and in the first class should this requirement be part of the summative assessment.\n6. The Use of Terms as Mandatory Course Requirements\nTerms requirements, detailing minimum levels of attendance or experience required before a final examination can be sat or a final grade awarded, can be enforced where there is a clear pedagogical rationale. The requirements must be communicated clearly to all students to whom they apply. Students must be informed in the paper outline and in the first class should this requirement be part of the assessment.All summative assessment components included in final grades must reflect performance on paper objectives. It is not appropriate to give grading credit for attendance at class sessions.Where terms requirements are in force, procedures for monitoring compliance with the requirement should be thorough, with fairness further ensured through proper early warning and appeal procedures.\n7. Feedback on Student Work\nAssessment during the semester (including drafts of thesis chapters) should be returned with feedback as soon as practicable after the work was submitted, and normally no later than three teaching weeks after the day the work was due.In addition to receiving a grade, students should receive a clear indication of the strengths and weaknesses of their work, normally accompanied by guidance on how to perform the task or a similar task better, (excluding the final thesis copy for submission).Where one summative assessment task in a paper is dependent on another, the second task should not normally be due until at least one week after feedback has been provided on the first.If the internal assessment task is relevant to preparation for the final examination, feedback should be provided at least one week before the final examination.All internal assessment not relevant to the final examination should be marked and available to students before the day of the final examination.Feedback timeframes may vary in papers less than a standard semester in length (e.g. Summer School papers), but the principle of providing students with feedback in a timely manner so as to inform subsequent assessment tasks, including the final examination, should be adhered to.\n8. Summative Assessment of Group Work\nPerformance on group tasks is an acceptable component of student final grades. The percentage contribution from group tasks should be justifiable in terms of the objectives of the paper.If more than thirty percent of a final grade is associated with group tasks, before individual grades are finalised the teacher(s) should take account of additional information about the contributions of individuals to group task results.Instructions for students about how to successfully complete group tasks, expectations of the group, and conflict resolution procedures, should be available in the paper outline, on the learning management site and/or in other documents made available at the start of the paper.\n9. Oral Assessment\nOral assessment should be used selectively, where the oral format is particularly suited to the skills and students being assessed.Where oral assessments are to be used, students should be given clear information at the start of the paper about the purpose, nature and scope of the assessment. They should also be given organised opportunities to practice the skills involved.Formally arranged oral examinations should normally involve at least two examiners.\n10. Student Workload\nThe number of internal graded summative assessment tasks in each paper should be kept to a minimum consistent with the educational objectives for that paper.Departments and schools should attempt to spread the assessment load for students taking popular combinations of papers.\n11. Monitoring and Moderation Procedures\nStaff are encouraged to consult appropriate peers when setting assessment tasks and deciding how to grade student responses to tasks.Paper co-ordinators should ensure that tutors and demonstrators receive guidance and training for their assessment activities, and that these activities are monitored for consistency of standards and quality of feedback provided.Where two or more staff share marking of an assignment or examination question, efforts should be made to achieve consistency and monitor its attainment.Where students are offered a choice of examination questions, the comparability of marks awarded for the different options should be monitored, evaluated, and where necessary adjusted.Departments and programmes should develop coherent approaches to assessment, put in place processes to ensure that assessment is appropriate and matched to expected learning outcomes, and examine assessment practices across their papers.Departments and professional schools should review obtained grades in papers before finalising marks, making adjustments where appropriate. While marks should not be fitted to pre-determined grade distributions or pass rates, it may be appropriate to treat mark/grade distributions as one factor to be considered when finalising marks.External moderation prior to the finalisation of marks is required for papers (including research projects and dissertations) that contribute to final year Honours, Postgraduate Certificate, Postgraduate Diploma, Master's, and Master's coursework programmes.The Board of Undergraduate Studies and the Board of Graduate Studies will monitor the appropriateness of assessment arrangements in the design of new and significantly altered papers.\n12. Academic Staff Development\nHeads of Departments should ensure that all academic staff are familiar with the University of Otago Teaching and Learning Plan (and Divisional and Departmental plans) and these guidelines before beginning teaching and assessment, or designing new papers.Heads of Departments should ensure that all tutors or demonstrators receive training before undertaking assessment of student work.The Higher Education Development Centre (HEDC) will provide opportunities for new and established academic staff members to discuss assessment practices and enhance their assessment skills and procedures.HEDC will arrange sessions that will help staff become familiar with the provisions of these guidelines and their justification."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_for_the_Inclusion_of_Material_from_a_Research_Candidate_s_Publications_in_their_Thesis", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_for_the_Inclusion_of_Material_from_a_Research_Candidate_s_Publications_in_their_Thesis.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all PhD and professional doctorate candidates.", "purpose": "The aim of these guidelines is to provide students, supervisors and other staff with information on the inclusion of a candidate's own published material in a graduate research thesis. \nThe University of Otago encourages publishing during candidature for a doctorate, and the inclusion of published material and/or work submitted for publication in theses where appropriate.

It may be necessary to alter the format of published materials for inclusion in the thesis, including standardising formatting and/or deleting duplicated material.Publications included sequentially may need to be linked by short bridging sections.If the hybrid thesis contains multiple publications, candidates need to ensure that they have: provided an introductory chapter to the thesis that gives some background context and rationale for the research, as well as describing the structure of the thesisdemonstrated their ability to critically engage with the literature, which may mean including a chapter (or substantive sections) critically reviewing the literaturecarefully considered their research design and justified choices of methodology and methods where necessary, which may mean including a chapter (or substantive sections) on research designsynthesised and discussed the findings from the publications, which may necessitate including a discussion chapter (or substantive sections).Where published material is included, the thesis must include a \u201cCo-authorship Form\u201d placed after the thesis abstract.It is expected that for any published material presented in the body of the thesis, the candidate will be a lead author.It is the candidate's responsibility to ensure that any published work (or parts thereof) included in the thesis comply with copyright provisions and that any guidelines with regard to self-citation are followed.\u00a0\u00a0More information on copyright is available on the University of Otago Library Thesis Information webpage.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Examination of the thesis\nThe inclusion of published material in a thesis does not guarantee a pass in the degree for which the thesis is submitted. The thesis must stand on its own merits and will be assessed as a single document. Examiners may require changes to any part of the thesis regardless of whether that material has been previously published or not.All aspects of the thesis including publications and appendices are examinable and may be raised at an oral examination. For example, if a co-author of an included publication conducted some analyses, the candidate may be required to answer questions regarding those analyses."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_for_the_Introduction_of_Coursework_180_point_Masters_Degrees", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_for_the_Introduction_of_Coursework_180_point_Masters_Degrees.html", "scope": "These guidelines are for the use of the academic (teaching) Divisions.", "purpose": "The purpose of these guidelines is to provide guidance to the University concerning the introduction of 180-point Masters' degrees.

These guidelines are designed to assist those who have direct input into the design and implementation of teaching/learning activities and structuring courses. \nPreambleWhere recordings of lectures and other teaching sessions are concerned, two questions should be considered: How can we take advantage of the ability to record our teaching sessions to support and enhance our papers, teaching and learning? To guide a response to this question, this document outlines principles underpinning good practices related to lecture recording at the University of Otago.Should lectures be recorded? This question is best answered at the Department / Programme / paper level. It is intended that the principles and practices outlined in this document will contribute to, and inform, local discussion and decision making.It is important to note that lecturer recording is optional at the University of Otago, but that the decision to record or not to record should be founded on departmental discussion. It is important that staff and students are clear about the rationale behind decisions concerning the recording of teaching activities.Research has shown the potential benefits of lecture recordings to student learning. However, there are still concerns that the provision of lecture recordings to students might alter the nature of students' engagement with learning in negative rather than positive ways.Wider concerns about the place of the lecture within any paper, and the changing value placed on 'the lecture' by teachers and students, point to broader challenges that are related to a myriad of factors including the evolving nature of teaching and learning at university, felt in many higher education contexts across the world.At Otago, an ongoing exploration of implementing institution-wide lecture recording protocols across all papers has revealed that decisions to record are at the discretion of the Department, Programme, or Division. This arrangement enables decision-making about recordings to be made at the level where it makes most sense.It is important that the issue of the gradual decline in the numbers of students attending lectures in person that was occurring before the pandemic, is separated from the focus of this document, which is about the thoughtful and deliberate use of lecture recordings. The relationship between declining lecture attendance and lecture recording is not a simple causal one. It cannot be assumed that recording lectures is the only reason for declining numbers of students attending lectures in person, in real time. While the nature of student access to lectures through the provision of recorded lectures does have an impact on engagement, a lecture, whether recorded or in-person, is only one component in a whole system of interacting and interdependent components that make up a whole learning environment.Based on the assumption that the ability to record teaching and learning events is possible, this document focuses attention on presenting a set of guiding principles and practices to inform discussion and decision-making about how to use recordings in ways that will capitalise upon the advantages they can have for teachers, learners, and the enhancement of the learning environment.PrinciplesRecorded lectures are resources that teachers and students can utilise to enhance engagement and support active learning and promote equitable access for diverse students. A lecture or a lecture recording is one resource and, like resources available to students in a library, teachers cannot assume that the lecture or its recording will, on its own, provide sufficient support for students to succeed in their learning.Lecture recordings can be used as supplementary learning materials or, as in situations such as a pandemic, they can be critical resources for supporting emergency and remote learning.For distance and online students, lecture recordings may provide the mainstay of teaching and thus, in some situations, be core to student learning.Lecture recording supports accessibility and inclusion for students with vision impairments; dyslexia and other learning difficulties; autism spectrum disorders; anxiety; and other disabilities, as well as note-takers where these are provided by Disability Information and Support.There are various recording types, including, for example, class lecture recordings, student activities, teacher-self recordings, voice-over audio recordings, recordings where patients or guest lecturers are involved. Each type of recording requires that any intellectual property rights and associated privacy concerns be addressed.The provision of recorded lectures can be used to guide students towards directing their own learning in ways they know suit them best. Teachers play a critical role in directing and guiding students' use of recorded lectures to help students get the most from the resource.Active student engagement in learning is encouraged when teachers integrate recorded lectures appropriately within learning activities.Lecture recordings that contain third-party copyrighted material need to acquire appropriate copyright permission. Special attention should be given to adhering to legal requirements concerning intellectual property rights, academic freedom and privacy legislation, policy and regulations.Both teachers and students have responsibilities where the storage, access and distribution of recordings are concerned.See details in the Recording of Lectures and Other Teaching Activities Policy and the practical considerations outlined in the Copyright at Otago webpages. Recording of Lectures and Other Teaching Activities PolicyCopyright at OtagoThe introduction of new technology, including lecture recordings, into any aspect of teaching does have an impact. Monitoring possible effects that the introduction of any significant change to a paper on student engagement and teaching processes is important. This includes the introduction and use of lecture recordings.Teachers can obtain analytics about how students engage with lecture recordings and use them as evidence of learning uptake and paper evaluation.Interpretation of that data should be undertaken with consideration of the student, the particular paper, and the wider teaching and learning context.Practice guidelines for staffKnow how to make and use recordings Participate in training in the use of Echo360, including how to use the editing features and how to set up student access for your students enrolled in your papers Echo360 help for Otago staffEngage with staff at HEDC to discuss best practices in using recordings to enhance teaching and learning, and through participating in TELT Show Case sessions or TELT Master Classes.If you plan to use closed captioning or transcription, be aware of the language limitations of the system you are using. For example, closed captioning is usually set to a specific language. Additionally, te reo M\u0101ori will not be translated as te reo and this may cause offence. Moreover, there is a rangatiratanga issue here.Inform your students Provide explicit guidance to students about how to use recordings effectively and appropriately in your paper. Recordings will be more effective and supportive of student learning if they are made and used with thought and deliberate planning.In the Course Outline for your paper, include information about: how lecture recordings will be used to support learning.details about access to the recordings.when recordings will be released.where to find the recordings within Blackboard / Moodle / equivalent or Echo360 and length of time they will be available.Proposed template for course outline (DOC)When planning learning activities that make use of lecture recordings, calculate a realistic workload time and share that with your students to help guide them in how much time to spend on the activity.If the decision is that recordings of some or all the teaching sessions in a paper will not be made, ensure that you understand, and can explain, the rationale behind the decision to your students. In your explanation, draw attention to the nature of the activity and its connection with the learning outcomes. For example: Small group work that involves discussion and free-flowing interaction and focused activity, do not lend themselves to creating useful recordings. When the purpose and intent of the learning activity is to generate active engagement in this way, a recording will not facilitate the kind of engagement that is required for learning by a student who watches the recording without direct participation.Teaching sessions that highlight sensitive or personal information or deal with topics that could trigger adverse reactions from students are not suitable for recording. In these instances, careful/expert and responsive facilitation by a lecturer is vital, and cannot form part of a recording.If the decision is that recordings of some or all the teaching sessions in a paper will not be made, acknowledge that students may miss classes due to work, family or health reasons and note that alternatives will be available. Explain also that the provision of alternatives does not directly translate into making/providing recordings. This is especially the case when there is no commitment made at the start of the semester that regular recordings of certain kinds of teaching sessions will not be made.Plan your recordings Before each lecture, inform students that the lecture is being recorded. Let them know about the placement of cameras and whether they will appear on the recording or not.Always use a microphone, and check to ensure that it works before you commence your recording.Ensure you know which aspects of any lecture are recorded, e.g. the slide presentation and your voice, your image, the students' images etc. Knowing this will influence how you make use of the recording as a resource. For example, you may ask students to undertake a learning activity that makes use of written notes that you add to a whiteboard during the lecture; however, if the recording has not picked up those notes, then students watching the recording later will not be able to undertake the task.If you plan your recordings to be used by distance students, then make sure that you record yourself speaking along with the slide presentation, at least at some point within the recording. Seeing their lecturer / tutor as they teach is especially important for students who will never meet their teachers in person or see their face in a live session.If you write notes as you speak during a lecture, make use of a document camera, as this will ensure that the students present in the live lecture as well as those watching the recording will see the notes, as you write them.If you use material created by someone else, make sure that you are using it appropriately, within the terms of the license for its use. Copyright at OtagoPlan when you will use the \u201cpause record\u201d button if parts of the lecture would be inappropriate to record (such as sensitive topics or small group discussions). You can also review the recording later and delete sections using the editing facilities in Echo360 before making the recording available to students.When students ask questions or are invited to speak during a lecture, remember to repeat each question/comment into the microphone before responding, and/or provide the student with the microphone to ensure that what is said is recorded audibly.You can help students to focus on the key areas for learning, by planning your recordings in ways that draw attention to essential details and minimise those of less importance. Editing recordings afterwards can achieve the same effect.Capitalise on the advantages of recordings Just as you would use textbooks or other kinds of resources, integrate recordings as another resource within your teaching plan. Plan learning activities that direct students to make use of recordings in ways that engage them actively, not only with the content of the recording but also with other students, to build their conceptual and practical knowledge.Take advantage of the self-paced nature of recordings: students can slow down, freeze, pause, speed up, fast-forward, and rewind recordings. Include prompts, either within the recording itself or within the description of the learning activity that makes use of the recording, to direct students' attention to video sections of particular importance and thus assist students in making the best use of the recording for their learning.Evaluate the impact Just as you would with any aspect of your teaching, reflect regularly on the possible impact of lecture recording or the absence of it on teaching and on learning. Some effects may be seen in areas of interaction and communication but also across broader aspects of the learning-teaching processes you structure within your paper.Be sure to include the experiences of students with disabilities and students for whom English is not a first language.Make gathering feedback from students and others, such as tutors, about their experiences of lecture recording an explicit part of your formal and informal teaching and course evaluation plans.Practice guidelines to help you structure your advice to studentsTailor the following to provide explicit guidance and advice to students about the use of recordings within your paper.Preparation, planning and getting ready for learning: A recording of a lecture or other session, such as a tutorial within any paper, is a learning resource.Try to attend your live lectures and use the recordings to supplement your learning and review.Use recordings to revisit information or explanation you missed or do not understand. A recording is not a substitute for class attendance.As with all learning resources, a lecture recording complements a lecture but does not replace it, so you cannot rely only on the recordings if you want to succeed in the paper.If you plan to use lecture recordings as one component of a disability support plan, discuss the plan with your lecturer so they are aware of your needs and can help you make the best use of the recordings.Look through the Course Outline for your paper to determine if lectures and other sessions will be recorded. If recordings are to be made, the Course Outline will also describe how you will be expected to use them, where to find them, when you can access them and how long the recordings will be available.If the Course Outline informs you that recordings are not to be made of some or all teaching activities, take note of the explanation about why this is to be the case. Ask your lecturer about alternatives should you miss classes due to work, family or health reasons.Watching recordings: If you cannot attend a live lecture, your Course Outline may have advice about when you should plan to watch the recording after the recording is released. If there are no direct guidelines about this in your Course Outline, then make sure that you watch the recording within a week of it being made available.If you are watching a recording because you were not able to be at the live lecture, watch it at normal speed and make notes, as you would in the live lecture. You can then use your notes when you go back to the recording later to review or engage in any learning activity that has been set.Watch the recordings or parts of the recordings with a study group and talk about them with the group. Learning together can enhance your understanding. If you are asked to undertake a learning activity using sections of the recording, consider working on the task with friends. (Of course, if the task is an assessment task that has to be undertaken individually, this approach would not be appropriate).Making the most of recordings to support your learning: To help with your revision or undertake an activity that your lecturer has instructed you to work on, make good notes during the live lecture and review them as you watch the recording.Use recordings to enhance your learning from the lecture. If you find you are having trouble understanding a concept or some other aspect of the recording, use the recording as a basis for asking for help from your lecturer, tutor or other students.Use the recordings to help you to focus your attention on what is essential. For example: pause the recording while you make notes;run the recording at a slower speed to hear or watch details that you may miss when running it at normal or higher speeds;freeze the video so that you can look closely at a diagram or set of points on display;rewind sections of the recording to help you to review ideas and other essential points, especially if there are some ideas that you have trouble understanding;fast-forward through sections you are confident about or to quickly find sections your lecturer has said are of particular importance or needed for a planned learning activity.Reflection and review: Be ready and willing to share your thoughts with your lecturer, tutor or Class Rep about how helpful or otherwise the recordings of the lectures are for your learning.Further readingBelow is a list of further reading regarding recording of lectures and how to use lecture recordings effectively: Cardall, S., Krupat, E., Ulrich, M.

If there are no direct guidelines about this in your Course Outline, then make sure that you watch the recording within a week of it being made available.If you are watching a recording because you were not able to be at the live lecture, watch it at normal speed and make notes, as you would in the live lecture. You can then use your notes when you go back to the recording later to review or engage in any learning activity that has been set.Watch the recordings or parts of the recordings with a study group and talk about them with the group. Learning together can enhance your understanding. If you are asked to undertake a learning activity using sections of the recording, consider working on the task with friends. (Of course, if the task is an assessment task that has to be undertaken individually, this approach would not be appropriate).Making the most of recordings to support your learning: To help with your revision or undertake an activity that your lecturer has instructed you to work on, make good notes during the live lecture and review them as you watch the recording.Use recordings to enhance your learning from the lecture. If you find you are having trouble understanding a concept or some other aspect of the recording, use the recording as a basis for asking for help from your lecturer, tutor or other students.Use the recordings to help you to focus your attention on what is essential. For example: pause the recording while you make notes;run the recording at a slower speed to hear or watch details that you may miss when running it at normal or higher speeds;freeze the video so that you can look closely at a diagram or set of points on display;rewind sections of the recording to help you to review ideas and other essential points, especially if there are some ideas that you have trouble understanding;fast-forward through sections you are confident about or to quickly find sections your lecturer has said are of particular importance or needed for a planned learning activity.Reflection and review: Be ready and willing to share your thoughts with your lecturer, tutor or Class Rep about how helpful or otherwise the recordings of the lectures are for your learning.Further readingBelow is a list of further reading regarding recording of lectures and how to use lecture recordings effectively: Cardall, S., Krupat, E., Ulrich, M.

Salary and overhead costs are real and amounts received to meet these costs should not be redeployed to directly support research activities that were not costed in the original research grant application.According to current University financial management principles, all revenue is recognised within the Cost Centre where it is generated, including the indirect cost recoveries for externally funded research.It is acknowledged that externally-funded research that does not contribute overheads within a Cost Centre is still important. It can help to support the wider strategic objectives of the Cost Centre and University, including enhancing the reputation of the University, supporting postgraduate research, and allowing pilot data to be generated for fully-costed research grant applications.Externally-funded research should not compromise academic freedom or critic-and-conscience responsibilities of our staff or students.Maintaining strategic funds within Cost Centre budgets is encouraged, and can help contribute to seeding or supporting research activities at departmental and divisional levels.Allocation of strategic funds within a Cost Centre or division, some of which may be derived from externally-funded research activities, should follow fair and transparent processes that are aligned with the strategic priorities of the Cost Centre, Division and University. Hence grant holders should not expect to receive direct funds from overheads or indirect salary recoveries.Indirect Salary RecoveriesIndirect salary recovery (ISR) revenues account for the time spent on specific externally-funded research activities for staff who are in continuing employment in roles that require research. This will include, for example, academic staff with duties that include teaching, research and service, as well as those employed on research-only contracts. The use of revenues derived from indirect salary recoveries shall follow the following principles:As Indirect Salary Recoveries are cost-recovery for salaries already committed, funding should not to go directly to the individual staff member, including as additional salary.Indirect salary recoveries are recognised as revenue in the Cost Centre where the staff member is employed, with an expectation that such revenue is a necessary component of full-cost-recovery research required to sustain a productive research environment in the unit (department, centre, school, division etc.). Direct 'buy out' from other activities for the funded staff member should therefore not be the first call on these funds when the staff member has capacity within their normal workload to undertake the research.When the total indirect salary recovery for an individual staff member exceeds their normal research time allocation, indirect salary recoveries should be used for direct 'buy out' of time from an allied activity. In such cases, the buy-out plan should be agreed and recorded with the Head of Department before applying for external funding.It may be strategic for the Cost Centre to 'buy in' additional teaching or support for a staff member or team's allied activities, allowing the particular time needed to undertake an externally funded research project to be dedicated. For example, 'buy in' may be used to support routine marking or assessment activities, or help with routine course coordination or administrative activities, to free up time to dedicate to fulfilling the contract with the research funder. Such arrangements need to be specified in writing and approved by the HoD prior to the application for research funding.At the discretion of the Head of Department, other 'buy in' or 'buy out' arrangements may be required to allow the externally-funded research to proceed, for example: if the research requires commitment at times that were incompatible with delivery of certain components of normal teaching (e.g. requiring a semester free of teaching commitments for fieldwork or other time-sensitive activities on the externally-funded project); if time needs to be protected for other necessary research activities outside the externally-funded project (e.g. maintaining long-term discipline-focused research or scholarship); and/or buy-out is required for the reallocation of teaching or other duties within the department's workload model to allow the externally-funded research to proceed.Overhead RecoveriesThe overhead recovery components of externally-funded research projects are calculated using a methodology that globally accounts for the real costs to the University of providing infrastructure, staffing and other support that is not directly costed to the project.Overhead recoveries are revenues earned principally to cover additional participation fees allocated through university and divisional cost drivers to the Cost Centre from the research activity itself. For example, some cost drivers are related to staff or student numbers, so additional staff or students funded through the activity will result in additional participation fees. Some other cost drivers are also directly related to the amount of external research funding received by a Cost Centre.Overhead recoveries also account for costs borne within a Cost Centre that are not directly allocated through internal cost drivers, as well as to contributing to the revenue needed to support indirect costs of research supported by funding received without overheads (such as funding received from charitable organisations).For commercial research or research that is funded with a profit margin built into the overhead recovery rate, the net profit after the application of overheads for internal cost drivers, is available for use at the discretion of the Cost Centre head, with any such use being subject to all other University financial policies and procedures.For large-scale activities (such as CoREs, NSCs, HRC and MBIE programmes) the overheads may be of such a nature that application to directly support staff or costs that would otherwise be allocated through cost drivers may be permissible (e.g. direct payment of space charges, facilities costs or the contribution to salaries of dedicated administrative staff allocated to support the activity through the relevant shared service), but will require agreement by the relevant Academic Divisional PVC and the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) at the time of application for the funding.Strategic Funds to Support ResearchMany forms of university revenue, in addition to externally-funded research revenue, contribute to support research activity; this includes PBRF revenues, philanthropic donations, student tuition fees (to support the research-informed nature of the teaching) and student achievement component (SAC) funding from government. All of these income sources contribute to strategic funds that should be maintained over and above the direct- or indirectly-attributable costs of the activities themselves.Principles that should be considered when applying strategic funds to seed and support research are: All strategic research funds should be allocated through an open, fair and transparent process within the Cost Centre, School or Division. Allocation processes can be a mix of mechanisms that reward successful grant recipients, encourage early-career researchers to establish themselves for future grant applications, enhance M\u0101ori or Pacific research and seeding new collaborative or community-engaged research activities.Strategic fund allocation mechanisms must always link to departmental, school, divisional and university strategic imperatives. Strategic fund allocation policies, procedures must include diverse perspectives and decisions must be recorded and available for dissemination to Heads of Department, PVCs, Divisional and University Research Committees.Related policies, procedures and formsAdministration of Externally Funded Research PolicyAdministration of Externally Funded Research ProceduresExternally Sponsored Graduate Research ProceduresFinancial Delegations PolicyFinancial Delegations ProcedureFinancial Monitoring and Control PolicyResearch Consultation with M\u0101ori PolicyResponsible Practice in Research \u2013 Code of ConductSchedule of Financial Delegations", "content": "General PrinciplesIndirect costs, most generally for indirect salaries and overheads represent costs borne by the University in paying salaries, infrastructure and operational costs necessary to support the research activities for which external funding has been supplied.The Research and Enterprise Office is responsible for communicating the cost of overhead recoveries to funding bodies, and the University is accountable for the ways in which the funding is disbursed within the University in order to support the project(s) for which the funding was received.Research proposals should be costed as accurately and comprehensively as possible.

This may include: reuse of products across the University (preferable), repurpose to students, schools, and community groups, or if neither reuse or repurpose is possible, then recycling should occur.No E-Waste or batteries are to be placed in the general waste due to the environmental and fire risk implications of E-Waste in the landfill collection and disposal.Residential Colleges and UniflatsSustainability and the Waste Hierarchy should be considered in all aspects of campus living.Furniture across the Residential Colleges and Uniflats should be managed in accordance with the Asset Management Procedure and the Waste Hierarchy.All aspects of section 2 should be considered where practicable.Food waste should be avoided by ordering what is required, re-serving excess portions when appropriate, consideration in menu planning decisions, and donating to food recovery organisations or other appropriate recipients.Single-Use items such as disposable plates and cutlery should be discouraged, and where present they should be subject to Actionable Recycling.Users must be provided with adequate disposal instructions for Actionable Recycling to take place.All common spaces should have recycling and rubbish options available as per Section 2.Responsible waste behaviour should be part of all student\u2019s induction at all Residential Colleges and Uniflats.Construction and Trade Services WasteWaste should be considered in all aspects of construction projects.All projects should have a waste minimisation plan that follows the Waste Hierarchy to reduce the environmental impact of the build, including monitoring and measuring their waste to ensure diversion targets are met.Where possible, items should be reused or repurposed, including offering unused products to community groups where practicableWaste should be sorted into recyclable materials: The following materials should be sorted for recycling, depending on what is practicable: MetalsPlasterboardUntreated woodPVC pippingE-waste (including batteries)Other where available in locationsEventsWaste should be considered when organising conferences or onsite Events.All Events and conferences must have facilities to effectively collect separated waste streams, supported by clear signage or communication to support their effective use.Paperless or reduced paper is preferable.Single-use items (including conference favours) are discouraged.All Event holders will be provided with resources on how to effectively sort their waste in the Event location (ensuring Actionable Recycling).All Events must have a waste reduction and management plan.Food outletsWaste must be considered at all university food outlets in accordance with Section 2, which should include ordering supplies to eliminate over ordering, grouping batches to reduce packaging and transport, and focusing on purchasing refillable or recyclable options.All campus outlets must be single use cup free.All assets should be managed in accordance with the Assets Procedure and the Waste Hierarchy.Separated waste streams must include as a minimum landfill, glass, and mixed recycling.Food waste must be treated as per Section 2.Waste must be considered in the selection of all packaging, including eliminating all single use plastic items and substituting items which are Actionably Recyclable.All outlets must support \u201cuser brings\u201d packaging options where health and safety allows.Premises leased by non-University occupants operating as food outlets and food trucks must follow these guidelines were practicable.ProcurementWaste should be considered during procurement processes to ensure both contractors and the University follow the Waste Hierarchy.Contractors ordering materials on behalf of the University should be asked to: Rethink the supplies that are needed to eliminate over ordering,group orders into batches to reduce packaging and transport associated with many small orders, andwhere practicable, select more refillable or recyclable options as first choice for purchasing.Custodial Services contractors should consider the Waste Hierarchy during the removal of waste from buildings. If excessive contamination occurs, building users must be notified.Contractors must abide by the University Guidelines for Waste Minimisation and Management when on site.Emergency Waste Management PlanIn the case of an emergency where Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) protocols are enacted, specific waste management processes and actions may be required which do not comply with these guidelines.In such situations, waste management resources should be directed to supporting the emergency relief effort and enabling a safe return to usual practice, while complying with health and safety requirements such as appropriate protective equipment."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Guidelines_on_Timetable_Clashes", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Guidelines_on_Timetable_Clashes.html", "scope": "These Guidelines apply to teaching events scheduled within the University's central electronic timetabling system, as maintained by Timetable Services, Academic Services.", "purpose": "A timetable clash occurs when a student has two teaching events scheduled at the same time.

Support Fund\nA Support Fund is provided to support the Head's research.\u00a0\u00a0The Head may use this Support Fund within the criteria outlined below.Heads must submit a Support Fund budget plan to the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or Dean in Health Sciences) annually, for approval of how the Support Fund is to be used.The Head will make a case to demonstrate that the use of the Support Fund will be of benefit to their research programme. Examples of how the Support Fund may be used include: Provision of research assistance or teaching relief, such as short-term employment of a research assistant or teaching fellow for high workload periods or specific one-off tasks/projects.Purchase or rental of equipment that would not normally be available to the Head that would provide time release.Attendance at conferences and courses both within New Zealand and internationally.Visits to overseas universities and institutions to keep up to date with trends in the academic area.It is acknowledged that use of the Support Fund will vary across Departments and Divisions depending on circumstances and requirements of each individual Head.The Support Fund cannot be used to supplement existing Departmental budgets for general purposes or as a source of discretionary funds.Pro-Vice-Chancellors and Deans in Health Sciences will be required to ensure equity and consistency in the ways in which Support Funds are managed.Once the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or Dean in Health Sciences) has approved how the Support Fund will be used, the Head may use the Support Fund within that agreed plan.The plan and expenditure can be altered at any time during the year following agreement between the Head and the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Dean in Health Sciences.Unspent Support Funds do not carry forward into the next calendar year, i.e., they will not accrue from year to year."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Head_of_Department_Recruitment_Process_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Head_of_Department_Recruitment_Process_Guidelines.html", "scope": "Recruitment and selection of Head of Departments throughout the University.", "purpose": "To provide guidance and information based on current practice relevant to the Head of Department (HoD) recruitment process across the University. \nPlanningAcademic Leaders including PVC/Dean will annually consider and plan for leadership requirements for their Division by taking into account the following: The Academic Leadership Framework (PDF)Specific department needs and considerations, for example, upcoming staffing factors that will impact department's leadership such as current HoD term conclusion, forthcoming retirements, and significant periods of absence such as Research and Study Leave.Time available to establish and complete the recruitment and selection process: ideally 12 months ahead of the current HoD's appointment end date.

These guidelines apply to all public records created within the University, but the principles of records destruction and the methods of destruction are best practice advice for all types of information and records created by the University.", "purpose": "This document outlines the responsibilities of staff when destroying University information and records. \nPrinciples of Records DestructionAuthorisedThe New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA) is our legal authority to dispose of our public records at the end of the appropriate retention period and when they are no longer required by the University. Note that the DA applies to all information regardless of format. While the GDA sets out the minimum period for retention, staff also need to ensure that there is no administrative, business or legal need to keep the information and record before commencing destruction (see Information and Records Disposal Process below for more information on the delegated authority framework for approving the disposal of information and records).AppropriateAny destruction of information and records ought to be irreversible and complete to prevent the information being recovered again and to ensure that there is no risk of accidental or unauthorised access to the records. Appropriately managed destruction should also consider the environment, and where possible information and records should be destroyed in an environmentally friendly manner, such as recycling both paper and microforms (see Methods of Destruction below).Secure/ConfidentialInformation and records should always be disposed of with the same level of security that was applied during their lifetime. Security during the disposal process can include the use of securely locked document destruction bins and a contractor who transports the records in a totally enclosed and locked vehicle. It may also be appropriate for particularly sensitive records to have an extra level of security applied to them at the disposal stage such as in-house shredding before being collected by a contractor for destruction.TimelyAlthough timely destruction ought to be balanced by the organisation's desire to retain information and records for longer than the minimum retention period in certain circumstances, it is important not to keep records for longer than is necessary. The timely destruction of information and records helps to aid retrieval efficiency and minimise storage costs, and it enables the University to focus on information and records of greater value. For information and records where a decision has been made to retain for longer than the minimum retention period, reasons for the decision should be documented to assist in their later disposal.DocumentedBecause proof of destruction may be required during the course of an investigation, or in response to an information access request, or as part of a recordkeeping audit, the destruction of all information and records must be documented. A certificate of destruction should also be obtained from the contractor and placed on a file together with any other destruction documentation. The type of information to be captured includes:The date when the disposal took place;The disposal authority that applies;Which information and records were destroyed; andWho took the action and their authorisation.Methods of destructionArchives New Zealand recommends the following destruction methods:For paper: Shredding: this method reduces paper documents to fine ribbons;Pulping: this method reduces paper to its constituent fibres, and if often recycled;Burning: this method should only be undertaken only in an industrial facility operating an enclosed incinerator and is not the most environmentally friendly option; andDry maceration: this method reduces materials to fine particles. Note: Burying or dumping paper records are not appropriate methods of destruction. Paper may take months or years to break down and may be uncovered at any time. Destroying sensitive information: If available - both pulping and dry maceration are most appropriate for highly sensitive material. Shredding is appropriate, but where possible cross-shredding should be used for sensitive documents. Densely packed paper does not burn well so burning ought to be a last resort for this type of material.For digital information: Delete documents from the digital system or application they are stored in.Identify other systems or applications where duplicate copies may exist. For example, a document in your shared drive, Microsoft Teams, or email.Ensure that any documents you have deleted have also been deleted from your computer\u2019s recycle bin.Information and Records Disposal ProcessIf you are carrying out a destruction process, please contact Corporate Records Services for advice about the correct approach for this. Corporate Records will assist you to identify information and records due for disposal Using the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA)If necessary, Corporate Records Services may ask you to complete the Request for Approval to Destroy Form (PDF)Please note that the information and records must not be the subject of a current or pending investigation or access request.Please ensure that the University no longer requires the information and records and they are not required under any other legislation.When correct destruction has been carried out this will be documented by Corporate Records Services.It is not necessary to document the process of disposing of your low-level, routine administration records, such as those records outlined in\u00a0the Managing Routine Business Information in the Office guidelines.List of information Custodians who have overall responsibility for information under their managementCustodians are expected to work with Corporate Records Services and other areas that have specialist information portfolio responsibilities who can provide advice and assist them with meeting their responsibilities.Please see the below list of Information Custodians, as noted in the University of Otago Information Framework.

Note that the DA applies to all information regardless of format. While the GDA sets out the minimum period for retention, staff also need to ensure that there is no administrative, business or legal need to keep the information and record before commencing destruction (see Information and Records Disposal Process below for more information on the delegated authority framework for approving the disposal of information and records).AppropriateAny destruction of information and records ought to be irreversible and complete to prevent the information being recovered again and to ensure that there is no risk of accidental or unauthorised access to the records. Appropriately managed destruction should also consider the environment, and where possible information and records should be destroyed in an environmentally friendly manner, such as recycling both paper and microforms (see Methods of Destruction below).Secure/ConfidentialInformation and records should always be disposed of with the same level of security that was applied during their lifetime. Security during the disposal process can include the use of securely locked document destruction bins and a contractor who transports the records in a totally enclosed and locked vehicle. It may also be appropriate for particularly sensitive records to have an extra level of security applied to them at the disposal stage such as in-house shredding before being collected by a contractor for destruction.TimelyAlthough timely destruction ought to be balanced by the organisation's desire to retain information and records for longer than the minimum retention period in certain circumstances, it is important not to keep records for longer than is necessary. The timely destruction of information and records helps to aid retrieval efficiency and minimise storage costs, and it enables the University to focus on information and records of greater value. For information and records where a decision has been made to retain for longer than the minimum retention period, reasons for the decision should be documented to assist in their later disposal.DocumentedBecause proof of destruction may be required during the course of an investigation, or in response to an information access request, or as part of a recordkeeping audit, the destruction of all information and records must be documented. A certificate of destruction should also be obtained from the contractor and placed on a file together with any other destruction documentation. The type of information to be captured includes:The date when the disposal took place;The disposal authority that applies;Which information and records were destroyed; andWho took the action and their authorisation.Methods of destructionArchives New Zealand recommends the following destruction methods:For paper: Shredding: this method reduces paper documents to fine ribbons;Pulping: this method reduces paper to its constituent fibres, and if often recycled;Burning: this method should only be undertaken only in an industrial facility operating an enclosed incinerator and is not the most environmentally friendly option; andDry maceration: this method reduces materials to fine particles. Note: Burying or dumping paper records are not appropriate methods of destruction. Paper may take months or years to break down and may be uncovered at any time. Destroying sensitive information: If available - both pulping and dry maceration are most appropriate for highly sensitive material. Shredding is appropriate, but where possible cross-shredding should be used for sensitive documents. Densely packed paper does not burn well so burning ought to be a last resort for this type of material.For digital information: Delete documents from the digital system or application they are stored in.Identify other systems or applications where duplicate copies may exist. For example, a document in your shared drive, Microsoft Teams, or email.Ensure that any documents you have deleted have also been deleted from your computer\u2019s recycle bin.Information and Records Disposal ProcessIf you are carrying out a destruction process, please contact Corporate Records Services for advice about the correct approach for this. Corporate Records will assist you to identify information and records due for disposal Using the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA)If necessary, Corporate Records Services may ask you to complete the Request for Approval to Destroy Form (PDF)Please note that the information and records must not be the subject of a current or pending investigation or access request.Please ensure that the University no longer requires the information and records and they are not required under any other legislation.When correct destruction has been carried out this will be documented by Corporate Records Services.It is not necessary to document the process of disposing of your low-level, routine administration records, such as those records outlined in\u00a0the Managing Routine Business Information in the Office guidelines.List of information Custodians who have overall responsibility for information under their managementCustodians are expected to work with Corporate Records Services and other areas that have specialist information portfolio responsibilities who can provide advice and assist them with meeting their responsibilities.Please see the below list of Information Custodians, as noted in the University of Otago Information Framework.

What is Laboratory Animal Allergy (LAA)?\nLaboratory animal allergy (LAA) is an inappropriate immune response to otherwise harmless proteins (allergens) in the urine, saliva, fur, and skin cells of laboratory animals such as rats and mice. LAA affects 10-50 per cent of individuals who are exposed to these allergens. Symptoms include sneezing, running nose, eye inflammation, skin rash and, most seriously, asthma. In addition to a reduced quality of life for affected individuals, both employees and employers suffer due to absence from work and potentially, job loss. The allergenic proteins implicated in LAA are carried on microscopic dust particles that can remain airborne for considerable periods of time, and, unless contained, can migrate throughout a laboratory or animal facility. They can also be carried around a facility on clothing and hair. Although individuals who work directly with laboratory animals are most at risk of developing LAA, the migratory ability of the allergens means that LAA can also affect susceptible individuals who have no direct contact with animals. Some individuals have a greater chance of developing LAA than others, since risk factors include the amount of daily allergen exposure and the presence of pre-existing allergies. It is not currently known whether there is an acceptable upper limit for levels of laboratory animal allergens; the aim of LAA management must therefore be to reduce the levels to as low as possible.\n2. Guidelines for prevention of LAA\nThe Health and Safety in Employment Act (1992) and regulations, require the identification of significant hazards, and management of these hazards by the hierarchy of elimination, isolation or minimisation. LAA is considered a significant hazard, and therefore consideration of elimination of exposure to animal allergens is the first step. The University is managing the hazard controls through the required elimination, isolation and minimisation, as explained below.\n2.1 Engineering controls \u2013 working towards elimination\nThe primary engineering control to be applied is ventilation and extraction of the animal allergens to reduce the amount of airborne allergens, thereby reducing exposure. The air levels of allergens is also monitored, however, there is no international standard on the minimum safe exposure (workplace exposure standard) for animal allergens.\nRoom ventilation: the rate of room extraction, delivery of fresh air and downdraft created is designed to remove allergen loading in the air. The ventilation rates are based on international best practice guidelines at 10\u201315 fresh air changes per hour, with the animal rooms at negative pressure so that allergen laden air is not re-circulated to non-animal areas. The ventilation rates are monitored annually.\nIndividually ventilated cage systems: exhaust ventilated cages, or individually ventilated cages, remove the air from the cages (the direct source) and vent it straight outside, without re-entering the room. This greatly reduces the air borne allergens. The University of Otago will consider the installation of individually/exhaust ventilated cages as a part of the upgrade process of animal facility areas.\nCage change ventilation: The cage emptying, or dumping, generates large volumes of airborne allergens. To reduce the hazard, cage dumping stations are used with an extraction unit directly behind the waste receptacle. This unit drags the air from around the operator, across the dumping space, and then vents it to the outside away from the breathing zone. It is important that any cage changing is done with a cage dumping station and for the individual to wear a P2 mask.\nUnfortunately, engineering controls cannot completely eliminate the source of animal allergens \u2013 the animal dander and urine may contact the skin during handling, and manipulation of animals requires close contact. The methods of isolation and minimisation must also be applied through the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and administration (reducing time with the animals).\n2.2 Isolation and minimization: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)\nConventional facility with open shoe box cagingTaskHead coverScrubs/gown/lab coatGloves*P2 maskEntering facility only\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aHandling rodents\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aChanging cages\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aRemoving soiled bedding\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\nVentilated Cage Facility (EVC or IVC)TaskHead coverScrubs/gown/lab coatGlovesP2 maskEntering facility only\u00a0\u221a\u00a0\u00a0Handling rodents\u00a0\u221a\u221a\u221aChanging cages\u00a0\u221a\u221a\u221aRemoving soiled bedding\u00a0\u221a\u221a**\u221a\n*Must include a non-latex option **gloves more resistant to puncture (e.g. nitrile) may be required to reduce the risk of injury/exposure during the handling of soiled bedding.\nTo ensure the maximum protection for staff, PPE should be put on before entering the animal rooms and removed on exiting. All used PPE should be disposed of in appropriate receptacles prior to exiting the facility and should not be carried into non-animal areas such as laboratories, offices or public rooms. However, face masks can be reused; and stored in plastic bags between use.Risk of splash: where the work has a risk of splashing the face, as cage washing, a face shield or goggles must also be worn.\nMinimisation includes the wearing of appropriate PPE to prevent the allergens contacting the skin, or entering the breathing zone.\nConsistent use of PPE is essential in preventing/reducing exposure to allergens and these are readily available at the entrance of animal facilities. PPE that prevents skin contact and inhalation of animal allergens helps to reduce personal exposure and risk of sensitization as well as reduces the spread of allergens throughout the facility.\nThe required PPE for entry into animal facilities with conventional caging is:\nLong\u2013sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubsHair covers/bonnetsP2 respiratory masks\nWhere the animal facility has an individually ventilated caging system, the requirements are:\nLong-sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubs\nThe required PPE for entry into animal facilities with conventional caging is:\nLong\u2013sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubsHair covers/bonnetsP2 respiratory masks\nWhere the animal facility has an individually ventilated caging system, the requirements are:\nLong-sleeved laboratory coats/gowns/scrubs\nThere are circumstances where additional PPE is required, regardless of the caging system:\n1. Direct skin contact\nWhere the work involved requires direct skin contact (such as handling/picking up the animals) with the animals, including surgery, the following items are required in addition to the above:\nGloves (including an option of non-latex alternatives)\n2. Soiled bedding\nEmployees working with animals and/or soiled bedding must wear gloves (e.g. nitrile) and disposable lab coats or other coverings (e.g. scrubs). Gloves less prone to puncture (e.g. nitrile) along with proper animal handling and restraining techniques help to reduce the risk of bites. Hand washing and showering after exposure to allergens helps to dramatically remove allergens.\nGloves (including an option of non-latex alternatives)\n3. Risk of splash\nWhere the work has a risk of splashing the arms or face, and high risk activities such as cage changing:\na face shield or goggles must also be worn.\nTo ensure the maximum protection for staff, PPE should be put on before entering the animal rooms and removed on exiting. All used PPE should be disposed of in appropriate receptacles prior to exiting the facility and should not be carried into non-animal areas such as laboratories, offices or public rooms.\n2.2 (i) Supply of PPE\nPPE is provided in the Biomedical Research Facility (BRF) for authorised users. Other facilities are required to provide suitable PPE at departmental cost.\n2.2 (ii) Care of PPE\nPPE must be located close to the entrance/exit of the facility. On entering the facility, you must remove your jacket, etc, and then wash your hands before putting on a gown and head covering. If you are required to handle animals during your visit (rather than just sight observation) you must wear gloves. The facility will have somewhere to store the clothing items \u2013 either by hooks or lockers. Shared gowns are acceptable, providing they are not visibly contaminated. Your mask is an individual item (see below).\n2.2 (iii) Gloves\nGloves should be readily available with an option of non-latex gloves. Gloves need to be put on before handling any animals and disposed of immediately after removal. Hand washing is required before putting gloves on and on removal, particularly as you exit the facility.\n2.2 (iv) Gowns\nLong sleeves are required to provide protection to the forearms from dander and urine, and should be cuffed. There are a couple of options here: either cloth gowns are provided by the facility, stay within the facility and are laundered on site to the recommended temperature or laundered by a professional service. No gowns or animal facility clothing is to be taken home. Disposable gowns may be used and are for single use only and disposed of at exiting the facility.\n2.2 (v) Hair covers\nHair covers are to prevent the retaining of animal allergen particles in the hair which are then transferred to non-animal areas. Individuals wearing burqa or veils for religious reasons must ensure complete coverage.\n2.2 (vi) Respiratory protection/P2 masks\nAll respirators/masks must meet the requirements of AS/NZS 1715 to ensure an adequate level of protection. Surgical or dust masks do not provide any protection against airborne animal allergens and must not be used. A Particulate 2 or n95 mask is required to prevent the inhalation of animal allergens. These masks are available in single use disposable \u201cduck bills\u201d similar to a surgical mask. These masks may be with or without a valve. The following masks are available from New Zealand Safety.\nAll P2 masks are required to be fit tested \u2013 once the mask is on, cup both hands over the respirator and inhale sharply. If air flows around the edges readjust the nose piece and straps and repeat the process. If the mask does not fit correctly, it will not protect you. If you have facial hair, these types of mask will not provide you with protection as you will not be able to achieve a proper fit. Please see the H&S team to advise you on a correct fit.\n\nAbove \u2013 single use disposable P2 mask\nThe following masks may be reused, however as soon as the mask becomes wet it must be disposed of. If you are reusing these masks, they must be stored in a sealed plastic bag between uses and remain in the animal facility. Valve masks tend to be more comfortable and cooler to wear.\n\nMask 2200 \u2013 disposable with no valve\n\nMask 2400 \u2013 this mask also has a charcoal filter to remove odours/fumes if you are using hazardous substances\n\nMask 8822 with valve\n\nMask 2700 - valve, cotton with no latex and neck string\n\nHalf face rubber mask (8002) also available in silicon. These masks are fitted with replacement particulate cartridge filters. These masks are much cheaper and it is one per person. \n2.2 (vii) Air-fed respirators\nAir-fed respirators or positive air pressure respirator (PAPR) may be required to reduce exposure if you suffer from allergies to a species you work with. These respirators supply clean filtered air through a mask to the wearer, eliminating animal allergens to the breathing zone. Such respirators must be trialed and purchased in consultation with the H&S office. These respirators require full fit testing and on-going monitoring.\n3. Health surveillance\nHealth surveillance or monitoring is a part of the minimisation process \u2013 as the allergen cannot be completely eliminated from the environment and some exposure is possible then the potential health effects from the exposure must be monitored.\n3.1 Identifying those requiring surveillance\nAll staff and students who will be handling animals or exposed to the animal housing environment are enrolled in the health surveillance programme. All animal related appointments, such as technician staff, are enrolled in the health surveillance programme.  Staff and students identified on Animal Ethics approvals through the Animal Ethics Committees who are required to complete module 1, are automatically notified to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). OHS will email the health questionnaire to the individual on receipt of the notification, and then follow up with the questionnaire programme. New staff employed in animal facilities or housing should have the hazard of LAA clearly defined in their job description. Once the appointment has been made, the details of the position and individual are to be forwarded to OHS for enrolment in the health surveillance programme.\n3.2 Pre-placement health assessments\nWhere the position/job description clearly identifies that the position requires monitoring based on the criteria above, then pre-placement assessments will be required. The position descriptions must be sufficiently detailed for people with a pre-existing allergy to make an informed decision on whether to apply.\nAs it is potentially damaging to the health of people with pre-existing conditions to be exposed to animal allergens, it is a condition of employment that a satisfactory health clearance is obtained by H&S before the individual starts work. This includes the transfer of staff between positions. Please contact the H&S office (extn: 5034) for further information.\n3.3 Register of potentially exposed staff and students\nIt is mandatory for those potentially exposed staff and students to have health surveillance in order to detect the early signs of LAA and take action to reduce the risk of a severe allergic reaction and of long-term respiratory impairment.\nThose identified as potentially exposed staff and students will be recorded in a confidential health information system through the H&S office that meets the requirements of the Health Information Privacy Code 1994, and the Privacy Act 1993. All files are held securely with access restricted to the medical staff within the H&S team. Staff and students may request access to their individual records at any time, and access by any other person outside the Medical H&S team will not be permitted without the written consent of the individual.\n3.4 Health surveillance programme\nThe health surveillance system will generate an email for the individuals to complete an on-line health questionnaire. If certain questions or a combination of questions generates a health trigger, the individual and the H&S Team will be notified. At this stage, further health monitoring may be required through a referral to a Respiratory Physician for appropriate testing.\nIf further monitoring identifies asthma type reactions, a report will be forwarded to the individual, and to the H&S team. If the H&S team is required to notify your employer, manager or PI of your fitness to work, this will be completed with your approval and to the consent guidelines. No personal medical information will be disclosed without signed consent from the individual concerned.\nIf the results demonstrate an allergy to laboratory animals, the OHS team may advise that you are removed from working with animals until test results are available, and full assessment has been made. With mild cases of sensitivity, it is possible to maintain individuals in their work with suitable personal protective equipment. Where this is not possible, suitable redeployment may be required.\n3.5 Diagnosed cases of LAA\nWhere LAA is diagnosed, the ACC processes of determining a work related illness will be initiated. The decision on the claim and entitlements will follow the ACC policies and procedures. Staying at work or returning to work will be managed by the ACC Case Management team."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Leave_Without_Pay_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Leave_Without_Pay_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These Guidelines apply University-wide.", "purpose": "The purpose of these Guidelines is to define the circumstances in which Leave Without Pay might be appropriate, the criteria which govern applications, and the approval process. \n\nApplications for leave without pay will be approved only if the interests of the University are fully protected and it is expected that any leave granted will be for purposes beneficial to the University.\nNo staff member shall normally be eligible to apply for leave without pay unless they have at least three years' continuous service with the University.\nGenerally it is expected that staff will have taken their annual leave before they will be eligible for leave without pay.\nA range of factors may be considered when applying for leave without pay.

Aligning with the University's Open Access Policy, the following guidelines are intended to provide staff and students with a practical framework within which to achieve the maximum reach and impact of their scholarly work.These guidelines may be applied to any element of the scholarly work of staff and students, though it is expected that they will apply mainly to research publications, i.e. scholarly articles or monographs. However, other work to which these guidelines may apply includes research data, teaching resources, conference papers, software, and so on.Consider potential issues relating to open access at the outset of researchFor some researchers, releasing information and data from their research openly is a fundamental principle and they will build this thinking into their project planning, research data management, ethics application, permissions sought from participants, and so on. However, all researchers need to be aware that, in certain disciplines, funders and publishers are increasingly requiring that research outputs and data be made available openly as part of the research publication. Sometimes this practice is 'encouraged' rather than required but, in some cases, it is mandated as a condition of publication. In other cases, the best publication venue for research may be Open Access-only, in which case APC cost may be a factor that should be considered from the outset.Alongside any considerations about intellectual property, openness should be considered when contracts or MOU s are developed at the beginning of a research project. For example, for researchers doing work with a high level of public utility or interest it may be important to ensure that contractual terms will allow dissemination of research outputs in the ways researchers need or want, especially where that research is funded from outside the university or is a collaboration with other groups or organisations.Open Access and ethicsIn terms of research ethics, where there is a possibility that research outputs may be made available openly (including anonymised data) best practice dictates that it is incumbent upon the researcher to make human participants aware of this possibility. Any significant change that is made in a research project that falls outside the parameters set in the ethics approval process may require new approval being sought from participants. High standards of ethical behaviour in the treatment of research data and other materials is not affected in any way by these guidelines and such considerations may preclude the availability of making research outputs open.Notwithstanding the above, release of data and other outputs is entirely possible where researchers follow best practices for cleansing and anonymisation of data and other information gathered as part of research.Publication of research outputsRetain rights in formal publications Staff and students are encouraged to retain rights that allow deposit or other open use of their work; transfer to a publisher should only be done where necessary. Specifically, authors should favour publishing agreements where they retain copyright in their work and simply provide a licence to publish to the publisher. Where a copyright transfer is the option provided by a publisher the following considerations should be made, bearing in mind that contracts are negotiable: Do I have a licence to use my work as I wish? For example: Can I deposit it in a repository? Can I share it on my own or departmental website or via social media? Can I use it for teaching students? Can I develop it further and incorporate it into future publications or use it in my own future research?Is there an embargo period?Can I have rights revert to me after a period of time defined in the agreement?Will other people be able to access and/or use my work in ways that I would like, e.g. community groups, other researchers, students, government agencies?Use stable, non-commercial repositories for Green OA \u201cGreen OA \u201d is where a version of a work is made freely available via an institutional research repository or a similar repository, such as a discipline-specific archive or pre-print server. Very often the version of a work used in the Green method is a pre-publication version, such as either an initial draft (sometimes known as a \u201cpre-print\u201d) or version that incorporates changes based on feedback from peer-reviewers (a \u201cpost-print\u201d or \u201cAuthor's Accepted Manuscript\u201d). However, some publishers' policies allow the final version of record to be deposited, often after the observance of an embargo period.General points: Stable, non-commercial repositories should be favoured. OUR Archive should be the default for most Otago authors, since the University is committed to maintaining this resource; it is also indexed by Google Scholar and other indexing services. However, specific repositories may be more appropriate where this is the norm in a particular discipline.Staff and students are responsible for ensuring they comply with publishers', funders' or other requirements to ensure deposit in OUR Archive or other suitable repository of research outputs is legal. This may include stipulations about which version (if any) of a work may be archived or embargo periods that must be observed before a work is made openly accessible. The Sherpa/Romeo database provides information on publisher copyright policies and self-archiving. Sherpa/Juliet provides the same for research funders' policies.Commercial academic networking sites are widely-used and offer a popular means of providing access to research outputs for people who do not have access through institutional subscriptions. It is recommended that these be used in addition to, rather than instead of, stable non-commercial repositories since commercial sites have proven to be unstable in the long-term and may be bought out by competing interests.Gold Open AccessEvaluation of Gold OA publishers As with any kind of publication, authors must evaluate the quality of a potential venue for publishing their work. This can have important consequences for career, reputation and promotion. Most scholars will be familiar with attempts by \u201cpredatory publishers\u201d to attract researchers into paying for publication, often in publications without any peer review or editorial services. Such services are better thought of simply as low quality publications, just as there are low quality non-open access publications. Regardless of the business model of a publisher, due diligence should be exercised in evaluating a possible venue for publication. Consult the checklist available at thinkchecksubmit.org for evaluating the practices and policies of a journal.Free Gold OA versus APC -funded OA There are many considerations for a researcher when deciding where to submit work for publication. All things being equal, an open access pathway should be preferred to a closed one. As outlined in the Open Access Policy, free Gold OA should be favoured where this is an option and once other factors are considered.General points: Gold OA does not always involve payment of a fee or APC . Check the journal's policy on waivers. Many journals and publishers offer waiver of APC s, for example where authors have contributed to peer-review or editorial work.Paying for Gold OA is a decision for the relevant cost centre, where factors other than access to the work determine that paid Open Access is the best choice, such as publication in an APC -only journal with a high reputation.Hybrid OA \u2013 where a publication is not open access but offers the option to make individual pieces of work freely accessible for a fee \u2013 is, generally speaking, not supported by the institution as it is likely that the University already pays a subscription fee for access to the journal. Nevertheless there may be occasions where other factors determine that Hybrid OA is appropriate, such as a high-impact piece of work that may garner significant media and public interest.Resources: The University of Otago Library provides useful information about Research Publishing and Impact.The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group provides a factsheet on APCs:AOASG Factsheet no. 1: Article Processing Charges (PDF)The Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) provides a whitelist of open access publishers that meet a set of criteria in terms of policies and publishing practices.Other materialsFor teaching materials, staff should always consider how their work might be licensed. By default, all-rights-reserved will apply to their work but many staff do no label their teaching materials in any way at all. Doing so \u2013 whether this is with an all-rights-reserved notice or an open access licence or something else \u2013 helps their students to understand what they may or may not do with material and encourages them to treat others' intellectual property with due respect.LicensingThe Creative Commons Attribution licence is the licence that facilitates the widest possible reuse, provided proper attribution is given. The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group provides a factsheet on Open Licences.AOASG Factsheet no. 2: Open Licences (PDF)Staff and students must ensure that applying an open access licence is appropriate, i.e. they cannot apply an open licence to third party copyright materials that are not open to use. Such work may be included but must be specifically marked as the copyright of others. Similarly staff and students are responsible for ensuring that they follow licences imposed by others, e.g. proper attribution or share-alike reuse, if reusing material made available by others under an open licence.It is also important to comply with funder and government agency requirements to make results of work publicly available where appropriate.FormatsStaff and students who wish to release work openly in digital format should consider use of non-proprietary formats so as to facilitate reuse by people but also machine-readability for search engines and other automated processes.Common formats include Comma-separated Value (.csv) for spreadsheet or tabular information or Extensible Markup Language (.xml) for written documents. Where proprietary formats are commonly-used, such as Portable Document Format (.pdf), making additional copies available in alternative formats may help to ensure maximum accessibility and potential for reuse.NZGOAL provides advice on choice of file formats for many different types of data and information.NZGOAL Guidance note 2: File formatsResourcesThe University of Otago Library provides useful information about Research Publishing and Impact.NZGOAL \u2013 the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (Version 2).thinkchecksubmit.org provides a useful checklist of things to evaluate the practices and policies of a journal.The Sherpa/Romeo database provides information on publisher copyright policies and self-archiving.

However, other work to which these guidelines may apply includes research data, teaching resources, conference papers, software, and so on.Consider potential issues relating to open access at the outset of researchFor some researchers, releasing information and data from their research openly is a fundamental principle and they will build this thinking into their project planning, research data management, ethics application, permissions sought from participants, and so on. However, all researchers need to be aware that, in certain disciplines, funders and publishers are increasingly requiring that research outputs and data be made available openly as part of the research publication. Sometimes this practice is 'encouraged' rather than required but, in some cases, it is mandated as a condition of publication. In other cases, the best publication venue for research may be Open Access-only, in which case APC cost may be a factor that should be considered from the outset.Alongside any considerations about intellectual property, openness should be considered when contracts or MOU s are developed at the beginning of a research project. For example, for researchers doing work with a high level of public utility or interest it may be important to ensure that contractual terms will allow dissemination of research outputs in the ways researchers need or want, especially where that research is funded from outside the university or is a collaboration with other groups or organisations.Open Access and ethicsIn terms of research ethics, where there is a possibility that research outputs may be made available openly (including anonymised data) best practice dictates that it is incumbent upon the researcher to make human participants aware of this possibility. Any significant change that is made in a research project that falls outside the parameters set in the ethics approval process may require new approval being sought from participants. High standards of ethical behaviour in the treatment of research data and other materials is not affected in any way by these guidelines and such considerations may preclude the availability of making research outputs open.Notwithstanding the above, release of data and other outputs is entirely possible where researchers follow best practices for cleansing and anonymisation of data and other information gathered as part of research.Publication of research outputsRetain rights in formal publications Staff and students are encouraged to retain rights that allow deposit or other open use of their work; transfer to a publisher should only be done where necessary. Specifically, authors should favour publishing agreements where they retain copyright in their work and simply provide a licence to publish to the publisher. Where a copyright transfer is the option provided by a publisher the following considerations should be made, bearing in mind that contracts are negotiable: Do I have a licence to use my work as I wish? For example: Can I deposit it in a repository? Can I share it on my own or departmental website or via social media? Can I use it for teaching students? Can I develop it further and incorporate it into future publications or use it in my own future research?Is there an embargo period?Can I have rights revert to me after a period of time defined in the agreement?Will other people be able to access and/or use my work in ways that I would like, e.g. community groups, other researchers, students, government agencies?Use stable, non-commercial repositories for Green OA \u201cGreen OA \u201d is where a version of a work is made freely available via an institutional research repository or a similar repository, such as a discipline-specific archive or pre-print server. Very often the version of a work used in the Green method is a pre-publication version, such as either an initial draft (sometimes known as a \u201cpre-print\u201d) or version that incorporates changes based on feedback from peer-reviewers (a \u201cpost-print\u201d or \u201cAuthor's Accepted Manuscript\u201d). However, some publishers' policies allow the final version of record to be deposited, often after the observance of an embargo period.General points: Stable, non-commercial repositories should be favoured. OUR Archive should be the default for most Otago authors, since the University is committed to maintaining this resource; it is also indexed by Google Scholar and other indexing services. However, specific repositories may be more appropriate where this is the norm in a particular discipline.Staff and students are responsible for ensuring they comply with publishers', funders' or other requirements to ensure deposit in OUR Archive or other suitable repository of research outputs is legal. This may include stipulations about which version (if any) of a work may be archived or embargo periods that must be observed before a work is made openly accessible. The Sherpa/Romeo database provides information on publisher copyright policies and self-archiving. Sherpa/Juliet provides the same for research funders' policies.Commercial academic networking sites are widely-used and offer a popular means of providing access to research outputs for people who do not have access through institutional subscriptions. It is recommended that these be used in addition to, rather than instead of, stable non-commercial repositories since commercial sites have proven to be unstable in the long-term and may be bought out by competing interests.Gold Open AccessEvaluation of Gold OA publishers As with any kind of publication, authors must evaluate the quality of a potential venue for publishing their work. This can have important consequences for career, reputation and promotion. Most scholars will be familiar with attempts by \u201cpredatory publishers\u201d to attract researchers into paying for publication, often in publications without any peer review or editorial services. Such services are better thought of simply as low quality publications, just as there are low quality non-open access publications. Regardless of the business model of a publisher, due diligence should be exercised in evaluating a possible venue for publication. Consult the checklist available at thinkchecksubmit.org for evaluating the practices and policies of a journal.Free Gold OA versus APC -funded OA There are many considerations for a researcher when deciding where to submit work for publication. All things being equal, an open access pathway should be preferred to a closed one. As outlined in the Open Access Policy, free Gold OA should be favoured where this is an option and once other factors are considered.General points: Gold OA does not always involve payment of a fee or APC . Check the journal's policy on waivers. Many journals and publishers offer waiver of APC s, for example where authors have contributed to peer-review or editorial work.Paying for Gold OA is a decision for the relevant cost centre, where factors other than access to the work determine that paid Open Access is the best choice, such as publication in an APC -only journal with a high reputation.Hybrid OA \u2013 where a publication is not open access but offers the option to make individual pieces of work freely accessible for a fee \u2013 is, generally speaking, not supported by the institution as it is likely that the University already pays a subscription fee for access to the journal. Nevertheless there may be occasions where other factors determine that Hybrid OA is appropriate, such as a high-impact piece of work that may garner significant media and public interest.Resources: The University of Otago Library provides useful information about Research Publishing and Impact.The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group provides a factsheet on APCs:AOASG Factsheet no. 1: Article Processing Charges (PDF)The Directory of Open Access Journals ( DOAJ ) provides a whitelist of open access publishers that meet a set of criteria in terms of policies and publishing practices.Other materialsFor teaching materials, staff should always consider how their work might be licensed. By default, all-rights-reserved will apply to their work but many staff do no label their teaching materials in any way at all. Doing so \u2013 whether this is with an all-rights-reserved notice or an open access licence or something else \u2013 helps their students to understand what they may or may not do with material and encourages them to treat others' intellectual property with due respect.LicensingThe Creative Commons Attribution licence is the licence that facilitates the widest possible reuse, provided proper attribution is given. The Australasian Open Access Strategy Group provides a factsheet on Open Licences.AOASG Factsheet no. 2: Open Licences (PDF)Staff and students must ensure that applying an open access licence is appropriate, i.e. they cannot apply an open licence to third party copyright materials that are not open to use. Such work may be included but must be specifically marked as the copyright of others. Similarly staff and students are responsible for ensuring that they follow licences imposed by others, e.g. proper attribution or share-alike reuse, if reusing material made available by others under an open licence.It is also important to comply with funder and government agency requirements to make results of work publicly available where appropriate.FormatsStaff and students who wish to release work openly in digital format should consider use of non-proprietary formats so as to facilitate reuse by people but also machine-readability for search engines and other automated processes.Common formats include Comma-separated Value (.csv) for spreadsheet or tabular information or Extensible Markup Language (.xml) for written documents. Where proprietary formats are commonly-used, such as Portable Document Format (.pdf), making additional copies available in alternative formats may help to ensure maximum accessibility and potential for reuse.NZGOAL provides advice on choice of file formats for many different types of data and information.NZGOAL Guidance note 2: File formatsResourcesThe University of Otago Library provides useful information about Research Publishing and Impact.NZGOAL \u2013 the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework (Version 2).thinkchecksubmit.org provides a useful checklist of things to evaluate the practices and policies of a journal.The Sherpa/Romeo database provides information on publisher copyright policies and self-archiving.

Drafting policy documents\nPolicy documents should be written in clear, concise and unambiguous language, and formatted so as to be easily readable.\u00a0\u00a0For policies and procedures, policy writers should aim to say what needs to be said with the minimum amount of text necessary (guidelines may include more detail).\u00a0\u00a0Jargon should be avoided.Policy writers should consult and apply the University Writing Style Guide.Policy writers should use template or sample policy documents available in the Policy Resources section on the Policy Library webpage.The contents of a policy document should be organised into numbered (e.g. 1, 2, 3) clauses or sections.\u00a0\u00a0Sections should be labelled to allow users to easily find the information they are looking for.Within each section, sub-clauses should be represented by letters (e.g. (a), (b), (c)).\u00a0\u00a0Each sub-clause should relate to a single idea and link to the topic of the section concerned.Where necessary, additional points can be listed under a sub-clause using small roman numerals (e.g. i, ii, iii).\u00a0\u00a0Bullet points may be used for clear lists of items, but the use of roman numerals is normally preferable.\u00a0\u00a0See also the University Writing Style Guide on bullet points/lists.For referencing purposes, text which is not in a numbered or lettered clause or sub-clause (as per sub-clauses 2(d) to (f) above) should be avoided.Consistent spacing and tabbing should be applied to enhance readability.Once drafting is complete, spelling and grammar checks should be run and the policy document manually proofread for errors and unclear or ambiguous language.\n3. Initiating new policy\nBefore initiating a new policy document consideration should be given as to whether a formal University-level policy is needed.\u00a0\u00a0The proposed policy Sponsor should be involved in these discussions.\u00a0\u00a0Questions that might be considered include: Is the matter addressed of University-wide significance?\u00a0\u00a0More local issues can be dealt with by departmental or Divisional policy.Is the matter addressed likely to be of ongoing significance? Policy should not normally be used to address transitory matters.Will a policy document have some tangible impact?\u00a0\u00a0Policies which have little real impact are discouraged.Will a policy document only describe operational processes?\u00a0\u00a0Unless they need to be formally communicated and established across the University, operational processes should not normally be expressed via University policy documents.Is there another more appropriate way to address the matter at hand, e.g. via communication with relevant parties, operational changes, etc.If a policy document is appropriate, is there any existing policy that could be amended to deal with the matter at hand, or is a new policy document needed?Different approaches may be appropriate for determining the initial content of a policy document: For technical policy documents, or policy documents arising from clear legislative or regulatory requirements, it may be appropriate for a single staff member to determine the initial policy content.Where the initial direction of a policy document is clear, but input from a range of areas is needed in the initial stages, a single staff member may work in informal consultation with a range of relevant staff.For matters which require expertise from a number of areas and/or where the initial direction of the policy document is not clear, a formal working group to determine content may be appropriate. For consistency and efficiency a single member of the working group should take primary responsibility for drafting initial content.Consideration should be given to whether a policy document should be classified as Policy, Procedures, Guidelines or a Code of Practice.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to taking into account the definitions of each of these types of document (see \u201cDefinitions\u201d above) the following may be considered: Policy is considered the highest level of the policy documents and is most appropriate for expressing a University position on a matter and/or detailing responsibilities of various parties (e.g. Heads of Departments).Procedures are particularly appropriate when detailing a specific course of action or process.Guidelines are appropriate for providing advice and/or for outlining a more general course of action.\u00a0\u00a0Compliance with guidelines is expected, but in exceptional circumstances justifiable variations from guidelines are permitted.Codes of Practice, which are less common, provide expected standards which must be complied with and normally relate to a specific domain (e.g. Responsible Practice in Research). A final determination on the right classification for a policy document may be made after initial content is drafted (content may help guide the classification).Where drafted policy content has a combination of policy, procedure and guideline aspects, a decision may be made on whether multiple documents are needed (e.g. a policy and associated guidelines) or whether a single document will suffice. Ease of use by those accessing the policy document(s) should guide this decision.A single document is often preferable for simplicity, unless this makes the document too long or complex.It is acceptable to have a policy which also includes procedural details and/or associated guidance.\n4. Review of policy documents\nPolicy review should consider: whether the policy is achieving its purpose and is still neededwhether the policy reflects the current University context and/or current University practiceany lessons learnt since the policy was initiated or last reviewedany changes to related policies, regulations, statutes, legislation or other documentswhether the policy is well understood, andwhether the policy is clearly written and formatted in accordance with these guidelines.Policy review should be supported by objective evidence where possible, which may include feedback sought and received from policy document users, and statistics on access to the policy document within the Policy Library (contact policy@otago.ac.nz for this information).Where policy review leads to significant changes to a policy document, consultation on the amended document should take place as per clause 6 below.Completed policy reviews should be sent to the Policy Management Group, regardless of whether the review recommends changes to the existing policy document or not.\u00a0\u00a0This should be accompanied by a completed Policy Review Coversheet, available in the Policy Resources section on the Policy Library webpageAdditional information on policy review is available in clause 5 of the Policy Framework.\n5. Amendment of policy outside of formal reviews\nFor editorial amendments and administrative amendments which are required outside of a scheduled policy review, Responsible Officers should contact policy@otago.ac.nz with an explanation of the reason for the change and the amendment required.\u00a0\u00a0Such changes can be approved under clauses 4(a) and (b) of the Policy Framework.Minor amendments which are required outside of a scheduled policy review should be sent to the Policy Management Group for approval, with an explanation as to why the changes are required. Consultation should take place as appropriate to the extent of the changes (see clause 6 below).Where major amendments are required outside of a scheduled policy review, thought should be given to fully reviewing the policy at that point. For major changes consultation (clause 6) is strongly recommended and formal approval (clause 7) is required regardless of whether a full review is conducted.Minor and major amendments outside of a scheduled policy review should only take place where there is a reasonable case for making the changes immediately. Otherwise, they should be deferred until the next policy review.\n6. Consultation\nConsultation allows the policy writer to test for broad acceptance and understanding of the proposed new or amended document and to identify any relevant matters which may have been overlooked in initial drafting.Groups to consult with will vary depending on the matters addressed, but could include: Academic Divisionsother University campusesspecialist academic areas (e.g. Summer School, Distance Learning)groups that can offer specialist advice on relevant matters (e.g. Planning and Funding, Human Resources, the University Library)staffstudents (often via OUSA )external stakeholdersM\u0101oriequity groupsrelevant committees, andrelevant senior managers, andthose with operational responsibilities under the policy document (e.g. ITS , administrative units).It is usually preferable to consult widely for new and significantly amended policy documents, but consulting with groups with little connection to the matters being addressed should be avoided.Consultation materials should include a covering memorandum or equivalent communication explaining the reason for the policy document, highlighting any important points and, in the case of amended policy, detailing key changes.Where an existing policy document has been amended, changes should be clearly indicated: for less extensive amendments, the use of tracked changes is recommendedfor more extensive but still limited changes, highlighting amended text and including the current policy for comparison is recommended, orfor comprehensively rewritten text, presenting both the amended and current policy document is recommended, with key changes highlighted in a covering memorandum.Sufficient time should be given for parties to respond to consultation requests (four to six weeks is standard).Where consultation produces significantly different viewpoints, a focused meeting with key parties may be an effective way to choose an appropriate approach.\n7. Approval of new and amended policy documents\nNew and significantly amended policy documents being sent for final approval must (in order): be sent to the policy Sponsor for endorsementbe sent to the Policy Management Group for endorsement, and thenbe sent to the appropriate Approval Body for final approval.Responsible Officers should take account of relevant committee meeting dates in planning for implementation of a policy document.Materials sent for approval should include a covering memorandum explaining the reason for the policy document, highlighting any important points and, in the case of amended policy, detailing key changes (this may be based on the consultation memorandum \u2013 see clause 6(d) above).Following step 7(a)ii above, the covering memorandum should also note that the policy document has been seen and endorsed by the Policy Management Group.\u00a0\u00a0Where the Policy Management Group has recommended amendments it should be noted that the Group's recommendation(s) have been incorporated (for which no explanation is required) and/or detail any substantive recommendations that have not been incorporated, with a brief explanation as to why not.Where an existing policy document has been amended, changes should be clearly indicated: for less extensive amendment, the use of tracked changes is recommendedfor more extensive but still limited changes, highlighting amended text and including the current policy for comparison is recommended, orfor comprehensively rewritten text, presenting both the amended and current policy document is recommended, with key changes highlighted in a covering memorandum.The Responsible Officer should be prepared to attend any relevant committee meeting to speak to the proposed policy document and answer any questions.Following approval the Responsible Officer must: make any changes required by the Approval Bodyprovide the Secretary of the Policy Management Group with the finalised copy of the policy document (email policy@otago.ac.nz) (the Secretary will coordinate the updating of the Policy Library), andensure completion of the Implementation and Communication Plan (see 1(k) above)."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Post_Earthquake_Building_Assessment_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Post_Earthquake_Building_Assessment_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all University of Otago owned or occupied buildings in New Zealand.

What is this category of Employment?\nStaff may be appointed to this category of employment where their employment is dependent on the continuation of sufficient research funding, as determined by the University.\nAlthough ongoing funding for the position is not certain, the employment will be permanent i.e. not fixed-term*. However, because both the staff and their Department will be well aware of the inherent uncertainty around continuation of the funding and therefore the role, the procedures for ending or altering employment due to the ending or reduction of funding are simpler and quicker than standard management of change procedures.\nThis category can apply to academic and general staff.\n *Fixed-term appointments are those where the employment is for a fixed term, for a specific purpose, with an end date specified. For more details on fixed-term appointment, please contact the Human Resources Division for advice. \n2. Who can be appointed to this category?\nPeople should be considered for this category if at the time of appointment:\nThey have been performing the same or similar research funded work within the same Department, on fixed-term agreements, for four or more years duration; orIt is the Department's assessment that the position is expected to be funded for the foreseeable future\n3. Are the terms and conditions different for this category?\nTerms and conditions such as salary, leave, and superannuation are the same for this category as for other categories of permanent staff. The only differences are around the provisions that relate to funding ceasing to be sufficient to keep the position\n4. What happens if the research funding ceases to be sufficient to keep a position(s)?\nIt is important for Principle Investigators and/or Heads of Department to consult with their Divisional HR Manager or Advisor immediately if they become aware that positions may be at risk due to the cessation of funding. This will enable an appropriate process to be put in place, which generally will consist of the following steps:\nIf circumstances arise that could result in a research funded position becoming surplus to the University's needs, staff and the Union(s) will be advised and two weeks will be provided for consultation about the implications of this change.If, following the consultation period, the University decides it is necessary to end the employment of research funded staff, they will be provided with one month's notice of this.During the notice period, options will be explored with them such as retraining and redeployment.If redeployment does not occur, the person's employment would end by way of redundancy.\n5. Do people employed in this category receive redundancy compensation?\nStaff employed in this category, who are made redundant, will receive compensation in accordance with the terms of their employment agreement.\n6. What happens if, as a result of a redundancy situation, a person is redeployed to other roles?\nNormally if a person is redeployed to another permanent role anywhere in the University, no redundancy compensation will be payable.\nIf the redeployment is to a fixed-term position and payment of redundancy compensation (at the end of that fixed-term) is reasonable in the circumstances, the HR Director may approve the payment of redundancy compensation and will determine the conditions related to this.\nIf, as a result of a reduction in funding a person agrees to reduce their hours of work, redundancy compensation will be payable, on a pro rata basis.\n7. Who meets the cost of any redundancy compensation?\nThe \u201cPolicy\u201d regarding the funding of redundancy payments for this category is:\nIn the Division of Heath Sciences, the costs will be split 1/3 Division, 1/3 School and 1/3 Department.In the other Divisions, the costs will be split 2/3 Division and 1/3 School.\nIn the case of redeployment to a fixed-term position (where redundancy compensation has been agreed), that also involves a transfer to another department, the basis for cost sharing for any payments will also be discussed between the Departments at the time and agreed and documented before the transfer is made.\n8. How long can a person remain employed in this category?\nTechnically a person can remain employed in this category indefinitely, however after a period of years it may be reasonable for a person to transfer to permanent employment. This will be by recommendation to the HR Director by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (on advice from the Head of Department). It is recommended that the status of people in this category is reviewed after six years of employment in the research funded permanent category."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Resources_for_Graduate_Research_Candidates_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Resources_for_Graduate_Research_Candidates_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply University-wide.", "purpose": "The University recognises the importance of providing appropriate resources for graduate research candidates to enhance the quality of their training. \nPrior to either (a) accepting a graduate research candidate or (b) approving a major change of topic and/or methodology during candidature, the Department/School concerned should assess the feasibility of the proposed research project in terms of the resources likely to be required for the successful completion of the project.The acceptance of a graduate research candidate represents the Department's/School's commitment to support the candidate's research project by providing the following resources: access to appropriate resources to undertake the candidate's research project (for example: equipment, materials, facilities, and funding for fieldwork or data collection or other activities considered essential to the successful completion of the project);an appropriately equipped working and quiet study/writing space, including secure storage;after-hours access to departmental facilities, provided both safety and security requirements are met;access to appropriate computing resources;access to e-mail and appropriate internet communications;access to library facilities including interloans and database searching;access to a telephone; andfor doctoral candidates, support to present at one major international conference at least (each Division is required to establish a policy about the level of support), in addition to support from Departments and Divisions to attend other conferences where appropriate and feasible.

Approval may be given in other circumstances by mutual agreement including retirement on medical grounds.Early planning for retirement is mutually beneficial in that it gives both staff and the University a more secure future, and enables both parties to plan with confidence.The University will provide guidance and support to staff wishing to plan for retirement, including an opportunity to explore options for managing a transition from full-time active service to retirement.The timing of retirement is a matter of individual choice, contractual notice period, and mutual agreement between the University and the staff member.Retirement planningIt is important that the disruption caused by the loss of expertise through retirement be minimised as much possible through early advice and planning. Some considerations in relation to succession planning within a Department, School and Division: Review the demographic profiles of staff to look for indicators or periods of change \u2013 e.g. is there a number of key staff where retirement within 3-5 years is likely?Are there any specific issues related to succession planning in a particular discipline or expertise?Are there staff with the appropriate capabilities and attributes available to fill key positions?What strategies are being developed or implemented to develop staff to fill key roles in the future?What are the characteristics of the future pool of academic staff (or other occupational groups) in particular disciplines - is it growing, shrinking, ageing or becoming younger? What are the inter-Divisional needs and options for inter-disciplinary collaborations?Are there strategies to attract, replace and retain future staffing in \u201cat risk\u201d areas? For example: retirement and phased retirement plans; professional development and mentoring programmes; building structured and supported career pathways; and flexible employment arrangements.Career planning discussions in performance review processes may include, where appropriate, retirement considerations. It may be appropriate to seek Human Resources advice.Staff are encouraged to plan and prepare actively for their retirement and to discuss their retirement plans with their HoD /Manager at an early stage. Information is available from Human Resources.Financial advice can only be provided by a registered Financial Advisor. The University is not qualified to provide financial advice. Regular financial planning seminars are provided by external advisors and staff are encouraged to attend.Retirement Seminars are provided and staff are encouraged to attend.SuperannuationThe University is party to a subsidised superannuation scheme \u2013 UniSaver \u2013 that eligible staff are encouraged to join. It includes a KiwiSaver Compliant version.Enrolment in a superannuation scheme does not occur automatically with the start of employment. Staff are required to apply to join a scheme.Note: Some staff are members of other schemes such as the Government Superannuation Fund which are no longer available to staff. Details can be viewed on the Human Resources website.RetirementStaff who wish to retire will ideally discuss this with their HoD /Manager in advance and must provide at least the minimum notice period required in their employment agreement. The staff member's notification of intention to retire must be made in writing to their HoD /Manager.Phased retirementPhased retirement may be granted where it is considered to be of benefit to the University as well as to the staff member.Phased retirement is formalised by a variation to the employment agreement. The variation must specify: FTE changes; the effective dates for each reduction; the retirement date; and the grade and step. If circumstances change, the variation may be varied by mutual agreement.Staff members on phased retirement will, within the constraints of a reduced FTE , be expected to continue to meet the normal range of duties for their role (e.g. a senior lecturer will continue to teach, conduct research and provide service appropriate for their role or a Service Representative Ask Otago will be available for rosters and tasks of the role within the FTE .) The HoD /Manager will consult with the staff member to determine the amount and type of duties expected.Staff intending to request phased retirement are recommended to consider the implications for their superannuation as some schemes have different criteria. Staff should seek appropriate advice from the scheme provider or Human Resources.A staff member who is eligible for a retirement gratuity will be paid the gratuity at the proportion they were employed at immediately prior to commencing the phased retirement. The phased retirement period will count towards the calculation of the payment.A participant will remain eligible for consideration for promotion and progression.

Approval may be given in other circumstances by mutual agreement including retirement on medical grounds.Early planning for retirement is mutually beneficial in that it gives both staff and the University a more secure future, and enables both parties to plan with confidence.The University will provide guidance and support to staff wishing to plan for retirement, including an opportunity to explore options for managing a transition from full-time active service to retirement.The timing of retirement is a matter of individual choice, contractual notice period, and mutual agreement between the University and the staff member.Retirement planningIt is important that the disruption caused by the loss of expertise through retirement be minimised as much possible through early advice and planning. Some considerations in relation to succession planning within a Department, School and Division: Review the demographic profiles of staff to look for indicators or periods of change \u2013 e.g. is there a number of key staff where retirement within 3-5 years is likely?Are there any specific issues related to succession planning in a particular discipline or expertise?Are there staff with the appropriate capabilities and attributes available to fill key positions?What strategies are being developed or implemented to develop staff to fill key roles in the future?What are the characteristics of the future pool of academic staff (or other occupational groups) in particular disciplines - is it growing, shrinking, ageing or becoming younger? What are the inter-Divisional needs and options for inter-disciplinary collaborations?Are there strategies to attract, replace and retain future staffing in \u201cat risk\u201d areas? For example: retirement and phased retirement plans; professional development and mentoring programmes; building structured and supported career pathways; and flexible employment arrangements.Career planning discussions in performance review processes may include, where appropriate, retirement considerations. It may be appropriate to seek Human Resources advice.Staff are encouraged to plan and prepare actively for their retirement and to discuss their retirement plans with their HoD /Manager at an early stage. Information is available from Human Resources.Financial advice can only be provided by a registered Financial Advisor. The University is not qualified to provide financial advice. Regular financial planning seminars are provided by external advisors and staff are encouraged to attend.Retirement Seminars are provided and staff are encouraged to attend.SuperannuationThe University is party to a subsidised superannuation scheme \u2013 UniSaver \u2013 that eligible staff are encouraged to join. It includes a KiwiSaver Compliant version.Enrolment in a superannuation scheme does not occur automatically with the start of employment. Staff are required to apply to join a scheme.Note: Some staff are members of other schemes such as the Government Superannuation Fund which are no longer available to staff. Details can be viewed on the Human Resources website.RetirementStaff who wish to retire will ideally discuss this with their HoD /Manager in advance and must provide at least the minimum notice period required in their employment agreement. The staff member's notification of intention to retire must be made in writing to their HoD /Manager.Phased retirementPhased retirement may be granted where it is considered to be of benefit to the University as well as to the staff member.Phased retirement is formalised by a variation to the employment agreement. The variation must specify: FTE changes; the effective dates for each reduction; the retirement date; and the grade and step. If circumstances change, the variation may be varied by mutual agreement.Staff members on phased retirement will, within the constraints of a reduced FTE , be expected to continue to meet the normal range of duties for their role (e.g. a senior lecturer will continue to teach, conduct research and provide service appropriate for their role or a Service Representative Ask Otago will be available for rosters and tasks of the role within the FTE .) The HoD /Manager will consult with the staff member to determine the amount and type of duties expected.Staff intending to request phased retirement are recommended to consider the implications for their superannuation as some schemes have different criteria. Staff should seek appropriate advice from the scheme provider or Human Resources.A staff member who is eligible for a retirement gratuity will be paid the gratuity at the proportion they were employed at immediately prior to commencing the phased retirement. The phased retirement period will count towards the calculation of the payment.A participant will remain eligible for consideration for promotion and progression. Where a staff member is approaching their final retirement date their HoD /Manager may agree to waive a performance review.Office and/or laboratory space and other support services will be allocated using the appropriate considerations. These requirements will be negotiated when developing the provisions of the variation.Applying to retireAn employee considering retirement or phased retirement should discuss this with their HoD /Manager and other appropriate persons, well in advance of the formal request.The staff member will complete a form, either notifying of their retirement date, having taken into account the notice period in their employment agreement and their planning discussions with their HoD /Manager; orapplying to take phased retirement.

Secondment opportunities may arise during periods of organisational change, or project work, or to cover employee absences, or recruitment periods.", "content": "1. When secondments are appropriate\nA secondment should be considered when there is a temporary vacancy and/or work to be undertaken that will provide opportunities for employees to: gain new skills and experience and acquire knowledge of other areas and rolesshare knowledge and provide expertiseutilise specialist skills and abilities for a particular project or taskbuild resilience and develop potentialdevelop leadership and project management skills. Secondment opportunities may arise during periods of organisational change, or project work, or to cover employee absences, or recruitment periods.\n2. When secondments are not appropriate\nSecondments cannot be used as a trial period before making a permanent appointment, or as a substitute for performance management, or problem resolution.\n3. Appointment Procedure\nThe recruiting manager should consider whether a position could be offered as a secondment before starting a recruitment process. The delegations for secondments are subject to the same delegation as for recruitment.Options for appointing to secondments of up to twelve month's duration are: Appoint a current employee for a period of up to 12 months to undertake the secondment by using the Direct to Offer process without the need to publicly advertise the vacancy.Advertise the secondment within their area or all of the University, inviting expressions of interest in order to provide a development opportunity for employees for a period of up to 12 months.Secondment opportunities of more than 12 months duration would normally be advertised within the University and be subject to the same recruitment process as a fixed term appointment.Employees wishing to apply for a secondment opportunity should discuss it with their substantive manager prior to applying.\n4. Points for a manager to consider when reviewing a secondment request\nIn determining whether an employee can be released to participate in the secondment, considerations will include the employee's professional development, the impact on the operation, the contribution to the University, and how the substantive role could be backfilled.Whilst the University supports substantive managers to release employees for secondment opportunities, in some instances this may not be reasonably done. For example, if there is important work that cannot be covered, or the employee has specialist technical knowledge that would be difficult to replace. When an employee is not released for a secondment, Managers are encouraged to explore alternative development and career options.Once a preferred candidate is identified the secondee and secondment manager should confirm the details of the secondment including duration, Performance and Development Review (PDR) processes and release plans with the staff member.\n5. Remuneration\nA secondment would not normally result in a reduction in salary level.\u00a0\u00a0However, there may be instances where the employee applies for a secondment to a lower level position for their own development. In this instance their salary will be applied in line with the Remuneration policy.If a secondment is to a higher level and the employee is on the Professional Staff Individual Employment Agreement or General Staff Collective Agreement, the Higher Duties Allowance provisions in those agreements will apply.If a secondee receives a Higher Duties Allowance and their substantive salary increases through the PDR process, then the Allowance must be reviewed.The Human Resource Director will consider remuneration for seconded professional employees on other employment agreements on a case-by-case basis.Where the secondment is at the same level, the employee will normally move across on the same salary. Future increases are managed via the PDR (Section 9).It is recommended that the remuneration is discussed with HR before any offer is made.\n6. Secondment Agreement\nThe Secondment agreement must have the appropriate delegated approvals and be completed by HR Services prior to the secondment commencing.\n7. Secondment Duration\nSecondments will normally not exceed two years. When the secondment covers a temporary absence, they will normally be for less than one year.\u00a0\u00a0If there are exceptional circumstances where the period of secondment might exceed these timeframes, advice must be sought from Human Resources.The term and notice period for a secondment can only be extended by agreement of all parties \u2013 the employee, and the secondment and substantive managers.\n8. Roles and Responsibilities\nSubstantive Manager During the secondment the substantive manager is responsible for maintaining regular contact with the secondee and keep them up-to-date on workplace developments or changes. This will ensure a smooth transition when they return to their substantive post.Secondment Manager During the duration of the secondment the secondment manager will be responsible for the allocation of work, supervision of their performance, and approval of annual and other leave.\n9. Performance and Development Reviews\nPrior to the secondment commencing, the substantive manager and the secondee will have a progress performance review for the period since the last formal review. The outcome of this review will be recorded on the PDR form.The secondment manager will meet with the employee at the commencement of the secondment to set their expectations and plans for development or training.During the secondment the substantive manager will normally have primary responsibility for the secondees PDR. In some instances, depending on the duration and location of the secondment and timing of the PDR, it may be appropriate for the secondee manager to be primarily responsible.\n10. Funding\nAll costs for the secondment including salaries, leave, training or development will be borne by the seconding department unless agreed otherwise. If the training is of benefit to both roles, then the allocation of the costs should be agreed on in advance.\n11. End of the Secondment\nThe secondee will return to their substantive post at the end of the secondment.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the end of the secondment, a meeting should be arranged between the employee and the substantive manager to discuss the implications of returning to their substantive position. It is recommended that the meeting takes place at least one month before the end of the secondment.At the end of the secondment period the secondee will revert to the pay and other terms and conditions of their substantive role. In some instances, there may be changes to pay as a result of PDR.A secondment can be ended early by either the secondee or the secondment manager by giving a notice period of not less than one month. If the secondee's substantive position is being filled during the secondment, the person filling the position must be aware that they may be given one month's notice, or less, if the secondment ends early.If the position that the secondee occupied or occupies becomes a permanent vacancy, the secondee will not have an automatic right to be appointed to that position.\u00a0\u00a0The secondee will be able to apply for the position as part of the recruitment process."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Seismic_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Seismic_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all University-owned and leased properties covered by the Seismic Policy as managed by Property Services.", "purpose": "To support Seismic Policy by providing operational and application guidance. To ensure that the seismic performance of the University's property portfolio is managed to an acceptable risk and to ensure improvements are made at optimal cost. These Seismic Guidelines will be used as guidance to enact the Seismic Policy and be applied by Property Services, Campus Development and its external consultants and contractors. \nGeneralThe University owns, occupies, and operates a large property portfolio in New Zealand and accordingly has a risk based, strategic asset management approach to its portfolio. As the University is a long-term owner-occupier for a significant portion of its property portfolio, the University adopts a holistic approach to achieving the appropriate balance regarding the level of design specification, maintenance requirements, refurbishment and upgrading within the overarching framework of the New Zealand Building Code (NZBC). This applies to resilience, costs, and speed of repair in response to a seismic event.These guidelines advise:The level of seismic resilience to be achieved in new buildsHow to quantify and ensure sufficient seismic resilience in any property acquisition (owned or leased)How to quantify and increase the seismic resilience of existing propertiesNew buildingsEarly decisions in the design of new buildings can greatly improve or detract from the building's seismic performance Well-conceived, well-designed and well-constructed buildings will perform better than other code compliant buildings.The University requires the design of all new buildings to consider whole of building seismic performance. This includes structural, non-structural, and seismic restraint considerations. The whole design team must agree and adopt a 'whole of building' seismic performance approach and agree on appropriate design parameters. The project specific approach adopted is to be agreed with the Seismic Assessment Steering Group. Once agreed, these design parameters become performance requirements in addition to those of the NZBC.Site Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment The University requires design teams to consult with the NZBC and/or NZ Standards and to consider undertaking a Site-Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment for all major projects. This is to ensure the design incorporates the latest seismic hazard information, and an appropriate amount of future proofing. The New Zealand National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) is subject to major updates, so specific seismic hazard assessments will need to capture and apply the key components of the latest NSHM at the time the Site-Specific Seismic Hazard Assessment is completed.Importance level The minimum requirements for Importance Level (IL) of the Building Act are to be met. The importance level is to be agreed with the Seismic Assessment Steering Group at concept design stage.Regularity At concept stage the architect is required to work with the structural engineer to conceive a structurally 'regular' building to improve seismic performance. The University requires building configurations with a continuous lateral load-resisting path with little or no irregularities and seeks buildings with regular distribution of mass and stiffness in plan and elevation. Where irregularities are unavoidable, during the concept design phase the design team must present to the University the reasons why such irregularities are unavoidable and the mitigations for review and approval.Limit states, ductility and displacements It is recognised that NZBC compliant buildings are designed to deliver life safety and basic amenity but not necessarily asset protection. At concept stage the design team is to agree Limit state performance, global ductility and building flexibility. When considering these parameters, secondary structure, fa\u00e7ade, seismic restraint, and ceiling/partition performance and costs are to be considered. Generally, the University prefers low ductility systems that are detailed for ductility for capacity design principles, and low displacement designs.Low damage design Low damage design concepts and philosophy are to be considered by design teams and the University at briefing stage. Guidance on low damage design can be found in the MBIE low damage design project or the Ministry of Education requirement for Service Limit State 2 (SLS 2) load cases in the structural and geotechnical requirements document.Peer review All significant capital works projects require an independent peer review. The peer reviewer should be engaged early to agree the concept/preliminary design. The scope of the peer review is to include both a regulatory review to support building consent and conformance with the University's performance requirements.Non-structural elements including building services In addition to meeting mandatory requirements, a holistic approach to the restraint of services and non-structural elements is required from the design team. This is to ensure that efficient restraint provisions and seismic clearances are included from the onset and that for the completed building, damage and remedial work requirements following a seismic event, are reduced to a practicable minimum. To this end design teams shall, during the briefing and concept design stages, consider the following: The location of main services routes/corridors, both horizontal and vertical and their coordination with structure and architecture to facilitate efficient (potentially common) restraint provisions and to ensure adequate spatial allowance including necessary seismic clearances.How and from what structural elements, services and other non-structural elements will be supported and restrained.How differential movement between services and penetrated elements can be reduced, especially where services penetrate fire separations, to reduce damage and remedial work requirements following a seismic event.Ensuring that restraint provisions do not prevent the operation of antivibration measures and allow for necessary thermal expansion and contraction (of heating pipework for example). Restraint of building services and other key equipment shall meet the University's business continuity and asset protection requirements. Some University facilities will be \u201cmission-critical\u201d or have a post-disaster function dependent on the avoidance of serious damage, or the ability for timely return to service, of key building services plant and systems. For other facilities with high-value central plant or scientific/healthcare equipment, the consequence of serious equipment damage in a relatively minor seismic event will far outweigh the additional cost of restraints with enhanced seismic performance. The types of systems and equipment, and the appropriate serviceability limit states, shall be identified in the adopted project specific approach the Seismic Assessment Steering Group.Seismic assessmentsSeismic assessments are to be of appropriate complexity and accuracy to fulfil the purpose. Seismic assessments must only be carried out by suitably qualified and trained CPEng structural engineers. When considering the type of assessment required figure 1 below should be used.The University would rather invest in appropriate building upgrade costs (including necessary design analysis) rather than sophisticated assessments that give a degree of accuracy not necessarily warranted at assessment stage.Figure 1.Image descriptionAssessment methodology Where assessments are in response to a territorial authority request for earthquake prone building status then the MBIE's chief executive methodology must be used (Red Book). In other situations, the University may require other methodologies to be used. Generally, this will be the NZSEE \u2013 Seismic Assessment of Existing Buildings (yellow book) but could be other recognised systems such as FEMA P58. Where a methodology outside of the MBIE guidelines is used this should be agreed in advance with the University.Initial Seismic Assessment (ISA) Where the consultant is confident that an ISA will pick up the issues/potential issues with a building and that the score is sufficiently accurate, ISA s maybe carried out. Noting figure 1 above the effort, cost and reliability of an ISA is a continuum. The consultant is to make efforts to access drawings when completing an ISA .Detailed Seismic Assessment (DSA) Where the building warrants a more thorough analysis, a DSA is to be undertaken.Peer review Seismic assessments that give unexpected results, indicate a score that triggers a significant occupancy review or indicate a significant re-strengthening project are to be considered to have preliminary status until they have been independently peer reviewed. An independent peer review shall be determined by the Director Campus Development or Director Property Services on a case-by-case basis.Occupation assessmentIt is policy to act responsibly with respect to safety of life for students, staff, and visitors to the University. The University Seismic Policy requires buildings with a rating less than 20 per cent to have a risk assessment carried out. This risk assessment will inform decisions on occupancy. The occupancy/risk assessment is to include:Importance Level If the activities that occur within the building are driving the Importance Level (IL), then the IL can be reduced when undertaking an occupancy assessment. This is in order to undertake an occupancy assessment on life safety risk rather than post-disaster operations. This will be determined by the Seismic Programme Steering Group.Hazard description/collapse description The Occupation Assessment is to provide more commentary on the Assessment Outcome information required in both the ISA and DSA Assessment Summary Report Template obtained from the EQ-Assess website: Templates \u2013 EQ-Assess Specifically identified structural weaknesses and locations are to be identified. The mode of failure and physical consequences statement is to describe how the weakness will fail, which areas will be affected by failure/falling objects and any likely subsequent failures/vulnerabilities as a result of this failure. This commentary is to be presented to the Seismic Assessment Steering Group in writing and also presented orally to ensure it is fully understood and allow questions so informed decisions to be made.Hazard management options In addition to hazard identification, the Occupation Assessment is to give options to control the hazard. The University wants to understand the options to ultimately eliminate the hazard but pragmatic short-term options that allow reduced or limited occupancy via engineering controls must be considered. Options may include staging of strengthening works to deal with issues that can be readily and quickly rectified, barricading off an area, limiting use of the building if that lowers the importance level or providing temporary propping/restraint to elements. The University requires this information to be presented in a table similar to below: Engineering statement of structural weaknesses and location Mode of failure and physical consequence statement(s) Hazard control options Type of control (eliminate, substitute, engineering, etc.)\n\n                Weakness 1\n\n              \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n                Weakness 2\n\n              \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seismic strengtheningWhere the seismic programme indicates strengthening is required on non-heritage buildings, the following guidance will be considered:Seismic strengthening work will be focused to provide the best overall improvements in life safety for students, staff, and visitors to the University. PSD will develop a programme to improve the seismic performance of the property portfolio. This will be endorsed by the Asset Management Committee and used to inform the Long-Term Capital Plan for the University.All strengthening work shall be considered in conjunction with the Strategic Asset Management Plan and Long-Term Capital Plan and other planned maintenance or alterations to the building.Seismic strengthening shall achieve at least 67 per cent NBS but aim for 100 per cent where practical. Exceptions to the 67 per cent NBS target can only be made in accordance with the University Seismic Policy.Strengthening shall address any severe structural weaknesses (SSW) as defined by the MBIE guidelines. Any proposed strengthening should not alter the load distribution such that other elements become critical at less than 67 per cent, or other Critical Structural Weaknesses (CSW) are introduced.Urgent strengthening work may target 34 per cent NBS as an interim strengthening step where appropriate.Where a significant capital investment is proposed, seismic strengthening shall be independently peer reviewed in accordance with the University Seismic Guidelines.Where a significant capital investment is proposed, a site-specific seismic hazard study should be undertaken to ensure future proofed outcome.Where building parts (e.g., chimneys, parapets, etc.) constitute a seismic risk, these may be strengthened or removed in isolation ahead of a comprehensive strengthening scheme. Guidance such as the MBIE \u201cSecuring parapets and facades on unreinforced masonry buildings\u201d should be considered. Loads should be transferred to the primary lateral system in such upgrades. Where a staged upgrade is proposed, the consultant team shall ensure the University understands the short, and long-term performance.Where seismic strengthening is undertaken, a post completion DSA or \u201cfinal\u201d assessment will be provided by the Structural Engineer to the Project Manager, confirming the level to which the building was strengthened, noting this may differ from the design target.Heritage buildingsAll heritage buildings are to have their heritage status considered in seismic strengthening designs.Strengthening designs should aim to minimise any potential heritage loss and should aim to create the least visual impact on the building. Technology or techniques yet to be developed may provide a better solution in the future.The durability of strengthening elements should match the likely life of the building where elements cannot be easily removed or replaced.Where the building is on the New Zealand Heritage List, the University shall engage a Heritage Architect to prepare a conservation report to inform the strengthening, with consideration given to likely strengthening techniques. A resource consent will likely be required in most cases.Where the building is identified as a \u201cCharacter-Contributing Building\u201d within the Dunedin City Council (DCC) District Plan (2GP) consultation with the DCC is required to confirm the protected building parts and approach to strengthening. A resource consent may be required.ReferencesFEMA P-58-1: Seismic Performance Assessment of Buildings, Volume 1 \u2013 Methodology, Second EditionThe Seismic Assessment of Existing Buildings \u2013 EQ-AssessDealing with earthquake-related health and safety risks: information for PCBUs and building owners \u2013 Worksafe", "content": "These guidelines support the Seismic Policy to enable risk-based decisions to be made in respect of the built environment.

The University Seismic Policy requires buildings with a rating less than 20 per cent to have a risk assessment carried out. This risk assessment will inform decisions on occupancy. The occupancy/risk assessment is to include:Importance Level If the activities that occur within the building are driving the Importance Level (IL), then the IL can be reduced when undertaking an occupancy assessment. This is in order to undertake an occupancy assessment on life safety risk rather than post-disaster operations. This will be determined by the Seismic Programme Steering Group.Hazard description/collapse description The Occupation Assessment is to provide more commentary on the Assessment Outcome information required in both the ISA and DSA Assessment Summary Report Template obtained from the EQ-Assess website: Templates \u2013 EQ-Assess Specifically identified structural weaknesses and locations are to be identified. The mode of failure and physical consequences statement is to describe how the weakness will fail, which areas will be affected by failure/falling objects and any likely subsequent failures/vulnerabilities as a result of this failure. This commentary is to be presented to the Seismic Assessment Steering Group in writing and also presented orally to ensure it is fully understood and allow questions so informed decisions to be made.Hazard management options In addition to hazard identification, the Occupation Assessment is to give options to control the hazard. The University wants to understand the options to ultimately eliminate the hazard but pragmatic short-term options that allow reduced or limited occupancy via engineering controls must be considered. Options may include staging of strengthening works to deal with issues that can be readily and quickly rectified, barricading off an area, limiting use of the building if that lowers the importance level or providing temporary propping/restraint to elements. The University requires this information to be presented in a table similar to below: Engineering statement of structural weaknesses and location Mode of failure and physical consequence statement(s) Hazard control options Type of control (eliminate, substitute, engineering, etc.)\n\n                Weakness 1\n\n              \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n                Weakness 2\n\n              \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seismic strengtheningWhere the seismic programme indicates strengthening is required on non-heritage buildings, the following guidance will be considered:Seismic strengthening work will be focused to provide the best overall improvements in life safety for students, staff, and visitors to the University. PSD will develop a programme to improve the seismic performance of the property portfolio. This will be endorsed by the Asset Management Committee and used to inform the Long-Term Capital Plan for the University.All strengthening work shall be considered in conjunction with the Strategic Asset Management Plan and Long-Term Capital Plan and other planned maintenance or alterations to the building.Seismic strengthening shall achieve at least 67 per cent NBS but aim for 100 per cent where practical. Exceptions to the 67 per cent NBS target can only be made in accordance with the University Seismic Policy.Strengthening shall address any severe structural weaknesses (SSW) as defined by the MBIE guidelines. Any proposed strengthening should not alter the load distribution such that other elements become critical at less than 67 per cent, or other Critical Structural Weaknesses (CSW) are introduced.Urgent strengthening work may target 34 per cent NBS as an interim strengthening step where appropriate.Where a significant capital investment is proposed, seismic strengthening shall be independently peer reviewed in accordance with the University Seismic Guidelines.Where a significant capital investment is proposed, a site-specific seismic hazard study should be undertaken to ensure future proofed outcome.Where building parts (e.g., chimneys, parapets, etc.) constitute a seismic risk, these may be strengthened or removed in isolation ahead of a comprehensive strengthening scheme. Guidance such as the MBIE \u201cSecuring parapets and facades on unreinforced masonry buildings\u201d should be considered. Loads should be transferred to the primary lateral system in such upgrades. Where a staged upgrade is proposed, the consultant team shall ensure the University understands the short, and long-term performance.Where seismic strengthening is undertaken, a post completion DSA or \u201cfinal\u201d assessment will be provided by the Structural Engineer to the Project Manager, confirming the level to which the building was strengthened, noting this may differ from the design target.Heritage buildingsAll heritage buildings are to have their heritage status considered in seismic strengthening designs.Strengthening designs should aim to minimise any potential heritage loss and should aim to create the least visual impact on the building. Technology or techniques yet to be developed may provide a better solution in the future.The durability of strengthening elements should match the likely life of the building where elements cannot be easily removed or replaced.Where the building is on the New Zealand Heritage List, the University shall engage a Heritage Architect to prepare a conservation report to inform the strengthening, with consideration given to likely strengthening techniques. A resource consent will likely be required in most cases.Where the building is identified as a \u201cCharacter-Contributing Building\u201d within the Dunedin City Council (DCC) District Plan (2GP) consultation with the DCC is required to confirm the protected building parts and approach to strengthening. A resource consent may be required.ReferencesFEMA P-58-1: Seismic Performance Assessment of Buildings, Volume 1 \u2013 Methodology, Second EditionThe Seismic Assessment of Existing Buildings \u2013 EQ-AssessDealing with earthquake-related health and safety risks: information for PCBUs and building owners \u2013 Worksafe"}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Space_Use_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Space_Use_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply to all University property whether owned or leased.", "purpose": "To supplement and provide guidance on the implementation of the Space Management Policy, ensuring that existing, new or refurbished space is utilised in the most effective manner across University Campuses. The objective of the policy and guidance is to create space which: \nSpace ManagementThe University of Otago Space Management Policy sets out the Management Principals for use of space.The University of Otago Property Services Division manages space planning and has developed guidance for flexible and quality space, working towards meeting current and future needs of the University. Space efficiency reduces building costs, in terms of both capital and operating expenditure. The University looks to make best use of its space to ensure it becomes a sustainable resource, meeting the needs of the operation and ensuring an enduring legacy for future generations.The University looks to improve utilisation year on year working towards a target optimal utilisation of space.The Asset Management Unit maintains a database of occupancy of all University building spaces, which is used as a basis for allocating space and for charging internal rent. It is important that the Asset Management Unit is advised of all changes in use and occupancy in order to maintain this important management tool.Given the varied building portfolio it may not always be possible to utilise space to its theoretical maximum. A sensible and pragmatic approach should be taken within the constraints of existing buildings.Departments and Individuals are occupants of a space for a time and purpose to best align with the strategic priorities of the University. Allocation of space does not imply a permanent allocation and is therefore subject to change as required over time to ensure optimal utilisation of space for the University as a whole.The efficient use of existing space, including shared use of specialist facilities will take precedence over the construction or provision of new space.New, refurbished and existing spaces will be designed, configured and allocated to provide for flexible use in order to assist in maximising space utilisation and minimising ongoing costs while supporting innovation and collaboration.Data relating to space condition, utilisation and occupancy will be used to inform and support decisions relating to new build, refurbishment or redesign needs and scope.Efforts will be made to collocate departments and facilities, and to share facilities across multiple or all departments, to ensure most efficient use of space and operational efficiency.Space Use: Office AccommodationOffice Accommodation Principles The University aspires to create modern, flexible, varied and appropriate working environments that allow staff to perform to their best. The University will utilise the guiding principles set out in the New Zealand Government Property Group guidelines for office design to assist and guide new or refurbished space development.View the New Zealand Government Property Group guidelines for office designOpen Plan Working Environments: Shared open plan collaborative work spaces for communal activity supported by collaboration space for use by individuals or for group communication and socialisation.Shared Collaborative and Quiet Spaces: Shared space which supports group collaboration and meetings and flexible quiet space which supports individuals undertaking concentrated work at times.Utilisation of Technology: Harnessing technology to allow staff to do their job.Mobility & Adaptability: The desk is no longer considered the only viable work setting. Dynamic working environments embrace a wide range of technologies, spaces and settings that encourage areas for high concentration work, discussions and collaboration.Consistent Design: Staff move while the furniture stays in place. A fixed, generic layout will be designed to maximise the efficiency of the floor plate. Teams should be formed and reformed around the requirements of projects and activities, not pods of desks.Choice of Workplace Settings: The design of the open-plan working environment should be dynamic enough to enable staff to choose from a range of work settings.Safe and Secure Environments: The University is committed to providing safe and secure work environments for all employees and visitors, including clients and contractors; considering the needs of people with disabilities in the design and fit-out of the working environment.Spaceless Growth: In any expansion The University will first maximise the current space before acquiring additional space.Further details around the specific use of the principles are covered in the University Design & Facility Standards.Details of space standards are set out in the University Design & Facilities Standards.The needs of staff undertaking teaching or research will be taken into consideration alongside these principles to ensure that space is appropriately located relative to teaching and laboratory facilities, however it need not be directly adjacent in all cases.For smaller scale adaptations where there are constraints on configuration, these principles will still apply as far as is practicable in the circumstances.Office Accommodation Allocation Staff will be allocated space in shared work areas or single occupancy offices depending on the availability of space, the requirements of their roles, levels of space utilisation and building configuration.Staff working across multiple University buildings or campuses will be allocated a workspace at their primary location, with access to hot-desk facilities at secondary locations.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple dedicated workspaces are not supported.Administrative functions should be centralised where possible to allow sharing of task and job roles.Space should be adequately supported by ancillary cellular space for meeting, hot desking, focussed work and breakout. Communal space increases informal and social interaction and is intended to help support knowledge sharing.New build or refurbishment project teams should identify exemplars of best practice relevant to the proposed work function to help demonstrate shared environments and their support spaces.Right-sizing the spatial requirements and increasing the quantity of shared accommodation can help realise the following benefits: Improved flexibility and sustainabilityImproved efficiencyReduced Capital and Opex costs to both University and individual Divisions & DepartmentsImproved staff and student satisfactionImproved collaboration and social interactionOffice space should not be designed at a density detrimental to the health and wellbeing of staff. Density of spaces should not be increased without consultation with Property Services.Meeting Space Meeting space can be both formal and informal space and will be made available to all building users.All staff will be granted access to appropriate meeting facilities, in their building where available and otherwise in close proximity.Meeting rooms should be available for use by all. Meeting rooms will all be bookable on a shared booking resource available to all staff.Staff Facilities Staff common rooms, tea rooms and kitchen spaces will function as staff break-out areas and informal meeting spaces and will not be allocated or dedicated to specific departments or divisions; staff rooms will be accessible for all building occupants and will be shared across departments.Staff facilities may not always be created to a size and scale where all department or building staff can congregate at one time. Where special events involving large numbers of people are required, departments should consider use of larger facilities which may be outside of their building or department; infrequent large gatherings do not necessitate provision of additional space.Staff facilities will take into account the number of prospective occupants to provide adequate, fit for purpose space.Occupants will be jointly responsible for management of the space.Reception Areas Reception areas will be customer-focused. They will normally include some form of staffed area and will have space adjacent for a range of support functions from copy and hand-in facilities to PC access. This will be dependant upon function and location.Reception desks should be easily maintainable, secure and readily accessible for staff and students. All receptions should incorporate a designated wheelchair access space in accordance with current building code.Space use: Student spaceAllocation of Space for Students The University endeavours to provide space appropriate to the needs of undergraduate and postgraduate students supporting a range of pedagogical learning and teaching methods, research, and social learning spaces.Student space should acknowledge the changing nature of technology within the student environment and should support learning and study in a wide variety of environments to encourage the activation of buildings and space. Adequate power and data provision should be provided to all of these spaces.Undergraduates Undergraduates will not be provided with dedicated space for individual students.Collaborative learning and interaction spaces should be provided within departments/buildings to allow undergraduates to stay within their department and benefit from increased interaction with peers and staff; refer Social and Informal Learning Spaces below.Undergraduates should have access to good quality study and learning space both in library buildings and in other spaces across campus. These spaces should be varied in nature and acknowledge the different learning environments required to suit differing student preferences.Postgraduates Where possible postgraduate space should be allocated close to academic space to allow supervision and interaction.Workspaces will be made available for postgraduate students in dedicated shared work areas depending on the postgraduate student's research activities and space availability, and subject to the Resources for Graduate Research Candidates \u2013 Guidelines.Workspaces will be managed in a collaborative and flexible way across departments, so that space can be reallocated to respond to changes in the relative number of postgraduates in different departments.Postgraduate space should be supported by access to sufficient meeting spaces to allow for confidential conversations and teleconferencing when required and have access to student amenities including space for eating and refreshments and social spaces which encourage interaction.Social and Informal Learning Space Students spend a large proportion of their time outside of the classroom. Students and academic departments value time spent with peers discussing academic work. Creating spaces for spontaneous discussion is particularly important and should be included within every remodelling and capital project.Spaces should be flexible and allow regular reorganisation of the layout both by students and staff. They can be located in rooms, or within circulation space (subject to compliance with fire regulations). There should be a variety of furniture types, to allow flexible working and suit personal preferences.Consultation with the ITS Division on the provision of equipment and facilities is essential, before planning these spaces. Traditional catering and Library spaces will also provide this type of learning space.Allocation of Space for Teaching Teaching spaces will be provided as required to suit teaching pedagogy. Consideration should be given to future pedagogy and flexibility of space to support varying teaching styles.Formal learning spaces are one of the most visible components of campus life. Formal learning spaces require line of sight, good acoustics, technology enabled and a focal point at the front of the room. When designing the teaching space it is important to understand what type of learning is required and support this with the appropriate layout and furniture.Current and targeted space usageSpace usage and utilisation is captured and managed by the Property Services Division under Asset Management. Information is used to inform decisions around space usage.TEFMA carry out an annual benchmarking survey of University space which provides data on a variety of efficiencies for comparison with other Universities. Whilst direct comparisons are difficult to draw based upon variability of levels of research and teaching, it provides high level comparison.Space is a valuable resource and comes at a high capital and operational cost. The University currently has too much space, inefficiently utilised, and looks to make better use of its space to ensure it becomes a sustainable resource, meeting the needs of the operation. The University has set aspirational targets as defined below (d-g) which will be assessed on an annual basis.UFA to EFTS Current TEFMA ratio of UFA to EFTS: Otago Actual 2016: 12.34m2University of Otago aspirational UFA to EFTS: 2024: 10.00m2UFA to GFA Current TEFMA ratio of UFA to GFA: Otago Actual 2018: 61.8%University of Otago aspirational UFA to GFA: 2024: 65.0%Staff office utilisation Current ratio of UFA (office) to FTE: Otago Actual 2018: 12.48m2University of Otago aspirational UFA (office) to FTE: 2024: 10.00m2Postgraduate space utilisation Current ratio of UFA (postgraduate office) to postgraduate EFTS: Otago Actual 2018: 7.27m2University of Otago aspirational (postgraduate office) to postgraduate EFTS: 2024: 5.00m2", "content": "Space ManagementThe University of Otago Space Management Policy sets out the Management Principals for use of space.The University of Otago Property Services Division manages space planning and has developed guidance for flexible and quality space, working towards meeting current and future needs of the University.

Introduction\nElectricity is a recognised hazard in the workplace and can lead to direct (e.g. electric shock) or indirect injury (e.g. from resulting fire, etc.).Electrical equipment can become faulty and regular inspections and testing can reduce the chances of faulty equipment leading to a hazardous situation.The testing of portable electrical equipment to AS/NZS 3760:2010 is a recognised reasonably practical step to meeting the requirements of the HSWA.\n2. What to test\nNon-specialised appliances Electrical equipment that is portable or frequently moved that is connected by a flexible cord to a power supply. Examples of this are kitchen appliances, overhead projectors, lights/lamps, heaters, computers etc. Cord extension sets, electrical portable outlet devices (EPOD's/multi-boxes), flexible cords, portable isolation transformers and RCD's (portable type, socket outlet type) also require testing.Specialised electrical equipment Each Department has a responsibility to identify specialised equipment. For example, medical equipment that attaches to patients. Once identified this needs to be referred to a specialist testing company or registered electrician to be tested.Where an appliance requires testing, but may be susceptible to damage by the testing process the manufacture instructions need to be obtained and adhered with.\n3. When to test\nThe standard requires testing of portable electrical equipment at the following times: Prior to initial introduction to service. If the equipment is new, AS/NZS 3760:2010 requires that this equipment be inspected, tested and tagged on entry to service;Before return to service after a repair or servicing, which could have affected the electrical safety;Prior to each hire of the equipment (for hire equipment, inspection only) and additionally tested at not greater than monthly intervals; andAs per table 2 of the standard (summarised from AZ/NZS 3760:2010).Type of environment and/or equipment (including cord extensions and EPOD's). Testing interval for each type of environment: Workshops - 6 monthsLaboratories (chemical laboratories), teaching spaces, tea rooms and office kitchens - 12 monthsOffice environment where equipment flexible cords are subject to flexing in normal use (e.g. OHP that is frequently moved around) - 12 monthsOffice environment where equipment is not subject to flexing of cords in normal use - 5 yearsResidential type areas (e.g.: accommodation) - 2 years.Construction and demolition sites - refer to AS/NZS 3012 for time frames and testing regime requirements. This is not the complete table. To view the complete table, please refer to AS/NZS 3760:2010 or contact Health, Safety and Wellbeing.\n4. Prioritising Equipment\nIt is recognised that some departments have a significant number of portable items for testing and that the initial testing will take some time for completion. Priorities for testing may need to be identified by the Department, depending on the degree of risk. Risk factors for consideration include: the environment the equipment is being used in e.g. wet areas, or equipment on stainless steel benchesthe age of the equipment (old=risk)equipment that is frequently moved, plugged and unpluggedequipment that is used by workers or students on a frequent and regular basis; andequipment that has high usage, including hiring to other departments and field work.This list is not exhaustive and departments are responsible for identifying the electrical equipment, documenting the regime for testing, and providing sufficient resources to achieve the plan.In addition to the testing regime, all workers should visually check electrical equipment prior to use and report any deficiencies. The visual check should include: obvious damage or defects to connectors, plugs, extension outlet sockets such as cracks, splits, burns, etc.flexible cords are anchored to equipment, plugs and cord extension socketscord sheaths are not cut, twisted or damaged so that the inner core is visibleno insulation tape has been used to cover wirescontrols in good working ordercovers, guards, etc. are secured and in working ordercheck that the ventilation inlets and exhausts are unobstructed.Any deficiencies identified by a visual inspection should be isolated for electrical testing and repaired if required. Mark the item with a DANGER - DO NOT USE tag and remove from the environment.All University of Otago workers must visually check equipment prior to use and report all faults or damage to electrical equipment to your DHSO or Technical Manager. Under no circumstances is a person to repair the electrical equipment, unless they are a registered electrician. All faulty or failed tested electrical equipment shall be removed and a permanent label or DANGER: DO NOT USE tag must be attached to prevent use.\n5. Who can test equipment?\nThe standard requires a competent person, who has acquired through training, qualification, experience or a combination of these; has the knowledge and skill to perform the testing task correctly. The University defines a competent person as one or more of the following: A registered electrician, or registered technician with electrical certificationA worker who is designated by the Head of Department or Support Service Manager to be an electrical tester, who has completed the necessary 'Competent Person' course within the last 2 years.A central testing meter is available for hire from Health, Safety and Wellbeing.\n6. Tester Responsibilities\nTested equipment must be clearly marked with a durable, non-reusable, non-metallic tag. The tag must identify the name of the person or company who tested the equipment, and the test or re-test date;To maintain documentation of the testing regime; andTo clearly label any items that does not pass the test. This equipment must be clearly marked or removed from the work area, and arrangements made to have the equipment repaired or destroyed. The label shall state ONLY REGISTERED ELECTRICIANS OR CERTIFIED SPECIALIST CAN REPAIR EQUIPMENT.\n7. Documentation\nWhere records of test and inspection are kept, the following should all be recorded: a register of all equipmenta record of formal inspection and testsa repair registera record of all faulty equipment.Regulatory requirements may require documentation to be kept in some cases. Refer to: AS/NZS 3000 (Electrical Installations)AS/NZS 3003 (Electrical installations - patient treatment areas of hospital and medical and dental practices)AS/NZS 3551 (Technical management programs for medical devices)AS/NZS 3012 (Electrical Installations - construction & demolition sites)AS/NZS 4249 (Electrical Safety Practices - film, video and television sites)In addition, records should be kept when the item in question is likely to need retesting within its prescribed lifetime.\n8. Medical Equipment\nMedical equipment (any equipment that attaches to patients/clients or animals) is specialised and has specific requirements. All medical equipment is to be tested by a certified specialist or registered electrician. Refer to The standard (New Zealand Electrical Code of Practice) NZECP 12.\n9.

Summary\nThe University seeks to provide a safe and comfortable working environment for all staff and students.For new buildings and major redevelopments, the University's Facility Standards will be used to ensure thermal comfort.For existing buildings, it will not always be possible to meet the desired level of comfort due to the limitations of the building. In those cases the University will endeavour to provide the best thermal comfort that can practically be achieved.\n2.

This target applies to all areas used for work, learning or research, and includes ancillary spaces used for these purposes (eg corridors containing informal learning or meeting space).It will not always be practical or cost-effective to meet these levels, so they are set as a target not a requirement.\n3. New buildings, and major redevelopments of existing buildings\nThe University's Facility Standards include provisions that will allow buildings to meet the target level of thermal comfort.All new buildings shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the University's Facility Standards.Major redevelopments of existing buildings which involve replacing building thermal elements (glazing, external walls, and/or HVAC systems) shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the relevant Facility Standards for those elements.\n4. Existing buildings\nWhere an existing building has HVAC systems, they will be operated to meet the target level of thermal comfort subject to the limitations noted in 1(c) above.Where an existing building cannot meet the target level of thermal comfort, remedial measures should be considered in consultation with the relevant Facility Manager, and could include measures such as blinds, external shades or performance coatings for windows, insulation, portable fans, glazing upgrades, improved control technology, supplementary heating or cooling etc.Thermal upgrade works will be programmed with reference to the Strategic Asset Management Plan and building priorities. Where possible, works will be undertaken within maintenance budgets for that building, but where significant cost is involved works will be subject to approval through the University's adaption or capital projects processes.No ventilation, heating or cooling machinery which is attached to the building such as heat pumps or air conditioning shall be installed unless this is approved by Property Services, to ensure safety, compliance and effectiveness.\n5. Where target level of thermal comfort cannot be met\nWhere the target level of thermal comfort cannot be met under Sections 2-4 above, people may take such measures as they can take themselves without affecting work obligations.Where those measures are not sufficient, people should discuss further options with their supervisor or manager to adjust their work to reduce discomfort.Any additional heaters, in-built fans or humidifiers should be requested from Property Services, to ensure safety, compliance and effectiveness.\n6. Health and Safety\nIn some circumstances thermal conditions can go beyond just being a comfort issue, and can create Health and Safety risks (e.g. extreme heat or cold, extremes of humidity, inability to wear correct protective equipment, inability to concentrate adequately for hazardous work).In those cases the response shall be at the discretion of the relevant supervisor or manager, with the options including relocating work to a different location or rescheduling work.Where such action is taken, the supervisor or manager must complete a Thermal Discomfort Notification (available on the Health and Safety website).\n7. Individual Requirements\nWhere an individual's personal circumstances require specific accommodation outside of the usual requirements (e.g. due to illness, a health condition or disability), the Occupational Health Team must be contacted for further assessment and the development of an action plan if required."}, {"policy type": "Guidelines", "name": "Tutors_and_Demonstrators_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Guidelines/Tutors_and_Demonstrators_Guidelines.html", "scope": "These guidelines apply University-wide.", "purpose": "The purpose of these guidelines is to outline the requirements of employing Tutors and Demonstrators. \nAll T&D must be employed using the standard University of Otago Employment Agreement for T&D.

Students on Conditional Enrolment are required to engage with a Designated Adviser of Studies before any course is approved.\n2.Repeating of Failed Papers\nA student may attempt to pass a given paper no more than three times. A student who has failed a paper three times shall not be permitted to re-enrol in that paper.Enrolling for Final Examination Only in the paper concerned, or enrolling in a paper with a different paper code which is specifically intended for students repeating the paper concerned, shall count as an attempt in terms of clause 2(a).In exceptional circumstances, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division responsible for the relevant paper, or their nominee, may approve a variation to clause 2(a) and permit further enrolment in the paper.Students that have enrolled for a third time in a paper will be contacted at the start of the paper and provided with targeted advice from a Designated Adviser of Studies.\n3.Conditional Enrolment\nThose students who do not pass half of the points enrolled for in a year will be advised that they will be placed on Conditional Enrolment the next Year they enrol.In the next year in which they enrol, students placed on Conditional Enrolment will be required to consult a Designated Adviser of Studies and enrol for a prescribed course of study.Each student placed on Conditional Enrolment will need to make formal application to enrol for a prescribed course of study, which must include provision of a satisfactory Back on Track Plan to a relevant Designated Adviser of Studies.A Designated Adviser of Studies will require a student on Conditional Enrolment to meet with them or make other suitable arrangements to discuss their Back on Track Plan.A Designated Adviser of Studies may approve a Conditional Enrolment student's course subject to such a discussion taking place.The prescribed course of study will be approved by the Designated Adviser of Studies, taking into account the student's previous academic record, previous experience and personal circumstances. Part-time study is permitted. The following restrictions will normally apply: no more than 54 points may be taken in each semester, and no more than 18 points in Summer School.no timetable clashes will be approved, andpermission will not be granted to enrol in any papers for which pre-requisites have not been met.If a student placed on Conditional Enrolment has already been approved for Final Examination Only enrolment in one or more papers, the Designated Adviser of Studies may review that approval in consultation with the relevant Head(s) of Academic Unit. Such approval may be rescinded, if the Designated Adviser of Studies and Head of Academic Unit concerned consider that to be appropriate.Disagreements that cannot be resolved between a student on Conditional Enrolment and the Designated Adviser of Studies will be referred to the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor for resolution.The prescribed course of study will be reviewed after the first semester of the year under consideration. Any changes to the prescribed course of study shall require the approval of the Designated Adviser of Studies, and restrictions as detailed in 3(f) above shall continue to apply.If half or more of the points enrolled for in the prescribed course of study across the full year of Conditional Enrolment are passed, Conditional Status will be lifted.\n4.Suspension from Study\nIf fewer than half of the points enrolled for in the prescribed course of study across the full year of Conditional Enrolment are passed, the student will be suspended from the University for a period of two years.Any Final Examination Only approvals granted prior to suspension, and still to be taken up, will be cancelled upon suspension.A student suspended under the Academic Progress Policy may request a review of the suspension decision by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor. Such requests, supported by documentation as appropriate, must be made in writing to the Director Student Experience within 14 days of the notification of suspension. Late applications will be considered only in exceptional circumstances.Students suspended under the Academic Progress Policy will be regarded as Recommencing Students if they register to return to study at the University of Otago after their suspension period. (For details on the admission requirements for Recommencing Students, see Clause 10.4 of the Admission to University Statute 2011.)Students who meet the requirements to return to study at the University after their suspension period will be placed on Conditional Enrolment in the year in which they recommence their studies.\n5.Transferring Students and Subsequent Study\nThe provisions of this policy shall be applied to students transferring from other tertiary institutions, with the academic record of such students being assessed at the point of transfer and the Academic Progress Policy being applied as if the academic record were a University of Otago record.Students suspended or excluded under the academic progress policies (or equivalent) of other tertiary institutions will not be permitted to transfer to the University of Otago until such time as that suspension has passed.A student with Conditional Status who is permitted to enrol in a course of study at the University of Otago that is not otherwise covered by this Policy and who passes half or more of the points enrolled for in a calendar year shall have Conditional Status lifted."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Academic_Promotions", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Academic_Promotions.html", "scope": "This policy applies to all Academic staff.", "purpose": "For the University of Otago to achieve its vision as a research-led university with an international reputation for excellence it must maintain a level of academic discipline and achievement that is respected world-wide.

Employees of the University are not usually a party to any Agreement unless they have permission in writing from the DVC R&E or the Vice-Chancellor, or where the Agreement is a three-party Agreement involving the funder, the University and the staff member or student (researcher).The R&E Office is the primary point of contact for communications with funders relating to contractual matters. Although researchers are likely to communicate independently with funders on a variety of subjects, any communications relating to contractual matters must go through the R&E Office.An Agreement is normally forwarded to the University by the funder when a decision has been made to purchase research or provide funding for non-exchange research. If a researcher (staff member or student) receives an Agreement directly, they are required to pass it onto the R&E Office in a timely manner.The Agreement is read, reviewed and negotiated by the R&E Office in consultation with the Lead Principal Investigator and/or other researcher(s) as appropriate.The final Agreement is signed by a representative of the funder and the DVC R&E or their delegated authority on behalf of the University.\n5. Contractual Obligations\nThe University of Otago (not individual staff) is the binding signatory on all Agreements and, as such, is required to ensure that any report(s) or product(s) are delivered in accordance with the Agreement.All reports required by the funder must be prepared by the Lead Principal Investigator in consultation with the appropriate R&E staff member and submitted to the R&E Office two weeks ahead of the due date stated in the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed. The R&E Office, where appropriate, will submit the report to the funder.The named Lead Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the research is undertaken in accordance with all ethical and regulatory requirements, University of Otago policies and procedures, the budget determined in the application and the contractual obligations of the Agreement. If the terms of the Agreement are breached \u2013 for any reason \u2013 the Lead Principal Investigator must immediately notify the R&E Office. Where the Lead Principal Investigator is unable to fulfil these responsibilities, their HoD will notify R&E of a suitably qualified alternate to ensure the University's obligations are met.Due to the dynamic and changeable nature of research, alterations to the protocols, procedures, timelines, milestones, objectives, etc. contained in the original Agreement may sometimes be necessary.

Responsibilities\nIndividuals are responsible for ensuring they take all their annual leave and that leave is recorded using the correct procedure on the Staff Web Kiosk.\nHeads of Department / Managers are responsible for ensuring that staff in their area have sufficient opportunity to take all their annual leave. It is acknowledged that our relationships with other agencies, such as the DHBs, may complicate our ability to do this.\nNote: There are a small number of special cases where the use of the Staff Web Kiosk is not applicable; these will be known to the areas involved and alternative recording systems are to be used.\n2. Annual Leave Definitions\nAnnual leave entitlements are outlined in each staff member's employment agreement.\nAnnual leave accrues during the course of the year and becomes an entitlement on 1 December each year, for use during the following 12 months.\n\nAnnual leave accruing throughout the year is called \"accrued leave\".\nWhen the accrued annual leave is allocated on 1 December it becomes the \"leave entitlement\" to be used within the following 12 months.\nAny previous leave entitlement not used by 30 November is \"carry forward leave\" e.g. any portion of the leave entitlement allocated on 1 December 2004 that has not been taken by 1 December 2005 (excluding the new entitlement allocated 1 December 2005 ).\n\nNote: The term \"leave accrual\" used by Financial Services refers to the balance of accrued leave, leave entitlement and carry forward, at a point in time.\n3. Managing Leave\nHeads of Department or Managers should monitor staff member's leave balances and the amount of leave taken and should ensure that all staff are provided with an opportunity to take their full annual leave entitlement for the year.\nStaff should have the opportunity to have at least one continuous two week break each leave year.\nWhere a staff member has a carry forward balance greater than 10 days then the person will take annual leave from the first normal working day following 1 January in the following year for a period sufficient to reduce the carry forward balance to 10 days, unless the Divisional Head or Dean (where applicable) expressly agrees otherwise in writing (this approval must be copied to Payroll Services).\nFor staff with clinical responsibilities the leave will be taken at the first available opportunity following the New Year, taking into account any rostered clinical duties.\nIf agreement is not able to be reached regarding the taking of annual leave, Divisional Heads or Deans (where applicable) may require staff to take annual leave. In this case as much notice as possible should be given to the staff member and not less than four weeks. The Divisional Head / Dean should write to the staff member, outlining the dates that the leave is to be taken. A copy should be sent to Payroll Services who will then book the leave into the Staff Web Kiosk.\n4. Taking Annual Leave\nProvided there is sufficient leave available, annual leave requests will be granted whenever possible, taking into account the needs of the Department.\nWhere it is necessary, budget holders should make appropriate provision in their staffing budget to provide coverage for employees taking annual leave throughout the year.\nStaff are able to anticipate annual leave ie take accrued leave before it becomes an entitlement. This is subject to their Head of Department's approval.\nIf a person resigns and has a negative annual leave balance, it is expected that the balance owing will be deducted from the final pay.\nWhere an employee or a person dependent on them becomes sick, or bereavement occurs when an employee is on annual leave or long service leave, then the employer will permit the period of sickness to be debited against their sick leave entitlement, provided a medical certificate is produced for the sick leave. This is in accordance with the University's employment agreements.\nAnnual leave recommences once the sick person is well again or the bereavement leave period is over, provided it was within the timeframes for which annual leave was originally sought. The leave records must therefore be updated to reflect the change in leave taken. This will require the employee completing the Leave Reversal Request on the HR website.\n5. Close Down\nWhere a close down period is observed between Christmas and New Year, or during some other time during the year, it is expected that staff take annual leave at that time.\nStaff who do not have enough accrued leave at the time of the close down period will either use their annual leave entitlement in advance or, if they wish, leave without pay will be granted.\nIn exceptional cases, where it is essential, a Head of Department may need staff to work during the close down. It is expected that the Head of Department will seek volunteers prior to requiring any individual to work.\n\nHeads of Department should seek the approval of the Division Head or Dean (if applicable) prior to requiring staff to work during a close down.\nPayroll Services must be advised when any staff member works during a close-down period.\n\nIn relation to staff with clinical duties with a District Health Board, the close down period does not apply. In this circumstance, people are not expected to be on annual leave from the University and will be paid in the usual way. Payroll services should be advised who is working.\n6. Annual Leave Recording and Approval\nAll requests for annual leave will be entered into the Staff Web Kiosk system by the person who intends taking the leave.\nFilling in the Staff Web Kiosk should take place after a discussion has been held with colleagues and the Head of Department or Manager and, if applicable, any other relevant agencies with whom the individual works, such as a District Health Board.\nLeave requests are to be entered into the Staff Web Kiosk prior to leave being taken.\nLeave requests must be considered by the person with the delegated authority to approve the leave.\nThe administrative process of approving leave within the Staff Web Kiosk may be delegated to another staff member (for example, a department administrator). In this case the person with delegated authority to approve leave must still consider the request and there must be an auditable record of the decision (ie approved or declined) held within the Department.\nLeave requests booked in the Staff Web Kiosk will escalate if not attended to within 96 hours of submitting.\nIf a staff member goes on leave without entering the leave in the Staff Web Kiosk the Head of Department may direct Payroll Services to record the leave.\nWhere a staff member is taking annual leave from 1 January, in accordance with the carry forward provisions, this leave record will be entered automatically by Payroll Services, where the individual staff member has not already done so.\nIf a leave approver is away, temporary delegation of leave approval within the Staff Web Kiosk can be made by contacting the HR Technical Team.\nWhere booked leave is not taken or where circumstances change, annual leave bookings can be changed by downloading and completing the Leave Reversal Request on the HR website.\n7. Delegations of Authority\nDelegations of authority for all types of leave can be found in the Leave Delegated Authorities Policy.\n8.

young people.\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of this policy is to affirm that commitment and ensure that the University meets its requirements under the Children's Act 2014 and other relevant legislation, through providing provisions for: \nReporting Child Abuse or NeglectStaff and students of the University who, in the course of their work or study for the University, come to believe that a child may have been, or may be at risk of being, abused, neglected or otherwise harmed, should take appropriate action as outlined in clauses 1(c)-(i) below.Staff and students who carry out part of their University work or study in the context of prescribed State Services, District Health Boards, schools, or other providers of children's services, should be aware of and adhere to any child protection policies in place in those organisations.Where a child discloses abuse or harm, or a concern about abuse or harm is raised, this should be documented, including recording: the disclosure (as close to verbatim as possible) and/or the concernthe date of any disclosure and who was presentany evidence in support of the disclosure or concernany advice receivedany action taken, andany other relevant information.Except where a delay in response is likely to endanger a child, staff or students are strongly encouraged to discuss any concerns they may have and any potential action to be taken with their supervisor, manager, Head of Department or the University Registrar.Where a person believes that a current or prospective staff member, student or other University representative may pose a risk to children in the context of University work or study, they should seek further advice from: The Director, Human Resources in relation to any staff member, orthe University Registrar in relation to any student or other non-staff University representative.Where it is believed that a child is in immediate danger, concerns should be reported to the Police.Where it is believed a child has been, or is likely to be, abused, neglected or harmed, but it is judged that they are not in immediate danger, concerns should be reported to Oranga Tamariki (Ministry for Vulnerable Children).Where a concern is raised, and it is subsequently determined that no risk to a child or children exists and that no action is to be taken, this decision and its rationale should be documented.Disclosures of, or concerns about, abuse should be treated as highly sensitive and appropriate standards of confidentiality should be maintained, subject to this Policy and the University's Privacy Policy.Nothing in this Policy limits the right of any person to report child abuse or neglect in accordance with Section 15 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989.Safety Checking of Staff and Students who Work with ChildrenFor the purposes of this policy, relevant child contact is: regular or overnight contact with a child or children in the course of University work, study or research (other than with children who are co-workers)without a parent or guardian of each child being present, andin the context of a regulated service as specified in the Children's Act 2014. Education services at tertiary level are not considered regulated services, and so teaching interactions with enrolled students aged 17 years or younger will not normally fall under the definition of relevant child contact, except where such teaching is carried out on behalf of a school or other regulated service.Any staff member who is likely to have relevant child contact in the context of their University employment shall be safety checked.Any student who has, or is likely to have, relevant child contact as a consequence of their enrolment in University programme(s) or paper(s), or as a consequence of any other official University activities, shall be safety checked.\u00a0\u00a0Child contact independent of University activities (e.g. through existing independent employment) does not require University safety checking.Safety checks shall be carried out as prescribed under the Vulnerable Children (Requirements for Safety Checks of Children's Workers) Regulations 2015.Safety checks shall occur: before the staff member or student commences work with children (or before deadline dates as specified under commencement provisions in clauses 25 and 26 of the Children's Act 2014), and subsequentlyat least every three years if the staff member or student is continuing in a University role which involves child contact.The University may accept, as meeting the requirement of clauses 2(d), written confirmation of a dated safety check concluding that a person is safe to work with children from: District Health Boards (DHBs), for staff or students who are currently employed by the DHB and for whom relevant child contact in their University work or study is primarily or solely within the context of the DHB, orany other organisation (including registering bodies), for staff or students for whom relevant child contact in their University work or study shall occur solely within the context of that other organisation. Such safety checks only apply to work in the specified contexts. Relevant child contact outside these contexts shall require a University-initiated safety check.The University shall endeavour to make clear to prospective staff, students and other University representatives, employment and study options, or other University business, which require safety checking, for example through position descriptions and recruitment processes, and programme and paper regulations and notes.The University reserves the right to require a full or partial safety check of any staff member, student or other University representative who has relevant child contact in the context of their University work or study, regardless of any previous checks carried out.The University reserves the right to appropriately restrict a person's University-based activities where a safety check finds that that person may pose a risk to children and/or is not permitted to work with children under the Children's Act 2014, or where no safety check has been completed.Nothing in this clause shall limit the University's obligation and right to take all necessary steps to meet legislative requirements.Safety Checking Oversight and ResponsibilitiesSafety checks shall be carried out by: Human Resources in relation to staff, andthe relevant academic department or division in relation to students.Departments, in consultation with Human Resources, are responsible for identifying University roles involving relevant child contact, and in such cases ensuring appropriate safety checking is carried out.Human Resources shall maintain records of staff safety checks, and advise departments which rechecking (under clause 2(e)ii) may be required.Academic departments and divisions are responsible for: identifying programmes and papers under their jurisdiction (excluding research-only programmes and papers) which may involve relevant child contact, and reporting this to: \u00b7 the Board of Graduate Studies or Board of Undergraduate Studies, through standard proposal or amendment processes, for new or amended programmes or papers, or \u00b7 the Manager, Policy and Compliance, for existing programmes or papersappropriately accounting for safety checking requirements in programme and paper regulations and notes, andensuring compliant safety checking and rechecking processes are in place for such papers and programmes and are carried out as required.Staff researchers, and supervisors of research students, are responsible for: reporting planned relevant child contact in research projects under their jurisdiction to their Head of Department and the appropriate University of Otago Human Ethics Committee as part of the ethical approval process for those projects, andorganising any associated safety checks that are required in accordance with clause 3(a).", "content": "Reporting Child Abuse or NeglectStaff and students of the University who, in the course of their work or study for the University, come to believe that a

(as close to verbatim as possible) and/or the concernthe date of any disclosure and who was presentany evidence in support of the disclosure or concernany advice receivedany action taken, andany other relevant information.Except where a delay in response is likely to endanger a child, staff or students are strongly encouraged to discuss any concerns they may have and any potential action to be taken with their supervisor, manager, Head of Department or the University Registrar.Where a person believes that a current or prospective staff member, student or other University representative may pose a risk to children in the context of University work or study, they should seek further advice from: The Director, Human Resources in relation to any staff member, orthe University Registrar in relation to any student or other non-staff University representative.Where it is believed that a child is in immediate danger, concerns should be reported to the Police.Where it is believed a child has been, or is likely to be, abused, neglected or harmed, but it is judged that they are not in immediate danger, concerns should be reported to Oranga Tamariki (Ministry for Vulnerable Children).Where a concern is raised, and it is subsequently determined that no risk to a child or children exists and that no action is to be taken, this decision and its rationale should be documented.Disclosures of, or concerns about, abuse should be treated as highly sensitive and appropriate standards of confidentiality should be maintained, subject to this Policy and the University's Privacy Policy.Nothing in this Policy limits the right of any person to report child abuse or neglect in accordance with Section 15 of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989.Safety Checking of Staff and Students who Work with ChildrenFor the purposes of this policy, relevant child contact is: regular or overnight contact with a child or children in the course of University work, study or research (other than with children who are co-workers)without a parent or guardian of each child being present, andin the context of a regulated service as specified in the Children's Act 2014. Education services at tertiary level are not considered regulated services, and so teaching interactions with enrolled students aged 17 years or younger will not normally fall under the definition of relevant child contact, except where such teaching is carried out on behalf of a school or other regulated service.Any staff member who is likely to have relevant child contact in the context of their University employment shall be safety checked.Any student who has, or is likely to have, relevant child contact as a consequence of their enrolment in University programme(s) or paper(s), or as a consequence of any other official University activities, shall be safety checked.\u00a0\u00a0Child contact independent of University activities (e.g. through existing independent employment) does not require University safety checking.Safety checks shall be carried out as prescribed under the Vulnerable Children (Requirements for Safety Checks of Children's Workers) Regulations 2015.Safety checks shall occur: before the staff member or student commences work with children (or before deadline dates as specified under commencement provisions in clauses 25 and 26 of the Children's Act 2014), and subsequentlyat least every three years if the staff member or student is continuing in a University role which involves child contact.The University may accept, as meeting the requirement of clauses 2(d), written confirmation of a dated safety check concluding that a person is safe to work with children from: District Health Boards (DHBs), for staff or students who are currently employed by the DHB and for whom relevant child contact in their University work or study is primarily or solely within the context of the DHB, orany other organisation (including registering bodies), for staff or students for whom relevant child contact in their University work or study shall occur solely within the context of that other organisation. Such safety checks only apply to work in the specified contexts. Relevant child contact outside these contexts shall require a University-initiated safety check.The University shall endeavour to make clear to prospective staff, students and other University representatives, employment and study options, or other University business, which require safety checking, for example through position descriptions and recruitment processes, and programme and paper regulations and notes.The University reserves the right to require a full or partial safety check of any staff member, student or other University representative who has relevant child contact in the context of their University work or study, regardless of any previous checks carried out.The University reserves the right to appropriately restrict a person's University-based activities where a safety check finds that that person may pose a risk to children and/or is not permitted to work with children under the Children's Act 2014, or where no safety check has been completed.Nothing in this clause shall limit the University's obligation and right to take all necessary steps to meet legislative requirements.Safety Checking Oversight and ResponsibilitiesSafety checks shall be carried out by: Human Resources in relation to staff, andthe relevant academic department or division in relation to students.Departments, in consultation with Human Resources, are responsible for identifying University roles involving relevant child contact, and in such cases ensuring appropriate safety checking is carried out.Human Resources shall maintain records of staff safety checks, and advise departments which rechecking (under clause 2(e)ii) may be required.Academic departments and divisions are responsible for: identifying programmes and papers under their jurisdiction (excluding research-only programmes and papers) which may involve relevant child contact, and reporting this to: \u00b7 the Board of Graduate Studies or Board of Undergraduate Studies, through standard proposal or amendment processes, for new or amended programmes or papers, or \u00b7 the Manager, Policy and Compliance, for existing programmes or papersappropriately accounting for safety checking requirements in programme and paper regulations and notes, andensuring compliant safety checking and rechecking processes are in place for such papers and programmes and are carried out as required.Staff researchers, and supervisors of research students, are responsible for: reporting planned relevant child contact in research projects under their jurisdiction to their Head of Department and the appropriate University of Otago Human Ethics Committee as part of the ethical approval process for those projects, andorganising any associated safety checks that are required in accordance with clause 3(a)."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Class_Representative_System_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Class_Representative_System_Policy.html", "scope": "This policy applies across the University and to the Otago University Students' Association.", "purpose": "The class representation system promotes communication and consultation between students and staff and supports the University's Strategic Imperatives of Excellence in Teaching and Outstanding Student Experiences.\u00a0\u00a0The Class Representative Policy provides guidelines on the administration of the class representation system, and aims to ensure that the value of having a class representative system is recognised by staff and students. \nThe University supports an institution-wide class representative system, administered and facilitated by the OUSA.The University benefits from the class representative system through: gaining constructive feedback from students on teaching and learning experiences;

The following principles guide how a Conflict of Interest should be identified and managed:\nAt all times people acting on behalf of the University must behave and be seen to behave in an impartial and transparent manner.The existence of a perceived or potential Conflict of Interest does not necessarily imply wrongdoing on the part of any person. However, any interests which could give rise to a potential Conflict of Interest must be promptly disclosed and managed and documented, in accordance with this policy as though they were an actual Conflict of Interest.Members of the University community must consider how an impartial observer might reasonably perceive a potential Conflict of Interest situation or relationship, whether or not any wrongdoing is involved.Managers and supervisors need to be alert to situations in which they, or the people that they manage or supervise, may have a Conflict of Interest and ensure that the situation is recognised and handled appropriately.If a person has any doubt as to whether a potential Conflict of Interest exists, they must disclose the matter to their Manager.The Ethical Behaviour Policy applies in the event that a Conflict of Interest arises from a staff-staff or staff-student relationship (including a family relationship).Potential Conflict of Interest may raise complex issues. Staff members, and their Managers or supervisors must judge each situation that arises in a prudent manner.Disclosure of potential Conflict of Interest may involve disclosing personal information. This information must be handled with due regard to the privacy of all individuals concerned and in accordance with the Privacy Policy and any applicable privacy statement.If a person has a potential Conflict of Interest in a matter under consideration, they must not take part in any discussion or decision on the matter giving rise to the conflict, unless the chair/relevant manager or supervisor decides otherwise.Where a person has a direct or indirect financial (excluding super funds managed by independent 3rd parties) interest in a matter being considered, they must not take part in any decision about the matter unless authorised to do so.Individuals who do not comply with the University requirements regarding the management of potential Conflict of Interest, as described in this policy, or other University policies or procedures, may be subject to disciplinary action.\n3. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest\nConflict of Interest must be dealt with quickly and transparently.Council members and senior staff will be asked to disclose Conflict of Interest on a regular basis.Any person involved in a procurement process will be asked to disclose Conflict of Interest as part of the procurement process.Other Conflicts of Interest: Where a staff member considers a Conflict of Interest may exist, they must disclose this in writing to their manager.Where the manager determines that a Conflict of Interest exists, or is perceived to exist, the manager will acknowledge the Conflict of Interest and either: Authorise the staff member in writing to continue in their current duties, orPut in place additional processes to ensure the impartiality of the staff member in performing their duties and advise the staff member in writing of these processes, orRe-organise the duties of the staff member to remove the Conflict of Interest and document the changes made, orReport the matter to the Vice-Chancellor for determination of appropriate action.The record of the decision made in relation to a disclosed Conflict of Interest under this policy must be lodged in the Conflicts of Interest Register, which is maintained by the Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance. The Manager is responsible for ensuring that the Conflict of Interest is recorded in the Conflicts of Interest Register and that the relevant divisional head is advised.\n4.

Rather the objective is to allow collaborative research teams from Otago and a partner university, that have found a high calibre PhD candidate, to propose jointly to their respective universities that a cotutelle project be established.\n2. Criteria for Establishing a Cotutelle Arrangement\nWhile it is not necessary for an institution-to-institution collaboration agreement to already be in place in order to establish a cotutelle arrangement, the proposed supervisors must provide evidence that ongoing and sustained research collaboration has taken place and is sufficient to support a PhD candidate.A cotutelle arrangement may only be established with the approval of the Joint Administrators (as defined in clause 4 (a)) after consultation with the relevant Pro- and Deputy Vice-Chancellors or equivalent senior officers at each institution. The Otago Graduate Research Committee must be satisfied that the collaboration will provide educational and professional benefits to PhD candidates and is consistent with the strategic directions of the University of Otago.A proposed cotutelle arrangement must be approved by the Head of the relevant department or school at the University of Otago.The University of Otago Graduate Research Committee must agree that there is an appropriate level of research collaboration, infrastructure support, and capacity for continuity of doctoral supervision at each university before approving a cotutelle arrangement.Due consideration must be given to the climate change impact of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with any additional travel required due to a cotutelle arrangement.\n3. Principles Governing Cotutelle Arrangements\nA formal cotutelle agreement must be drawn up between the two participating institutions in respect of each candidate. It will detail the particular arrangements pertaining to that particular candidate, including time to be spent at the two universities.All the normal regulatory requirements for an Otago PhD degree must be met in every respect.Throughout the cotutelle arrangement, the candidate will continue to be enrolled as a full-time PhD candidate at the University of Otago and is therefore subject to the University of Otago's regulations, rules, and policies.The primary supervisor must be a University of Otago staff member.The candidate must be accepted for admission at the University of Otago prior to the establishment of a cotutelle arrangement.A cotutelle arrangement must be proposed by the candidate's Otago supervisor and be formally established no later than the end of the first year of enrolment. Cotutelle agreements normally take effect from the beginning of a candidate's enrolment.The Otago Administrator will set out in a letter to the candidate all of the special arrangements that will apply to their cotutelle. This will include: a copy of the cotutelle agreement; the names of the supervisors and the Joint Administrators; the periods to be spent at each university; and other relevant matters.The cotutelle candidate will comply with Otago's progress reporting requirements as specified in the Handbook for PhD Study.Departmental resources to support the candidate and the research project, including travel, must be in place before the establishment of the cotutelle arrangement. Measures must be in place to minimise the climate change impact of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with travel.There is to be a single examination process, the successful outcome of which would be the award of the PhD from the University of Otago although the partner university may wish to also award a separate degree. The University of Otago will not award a double-badged (joint) degree.\n4. Joint Administrators\nThe Dean of the Graduate Research School at Otago and their counterpart holding this position at the partner university will act as Joint Administrators of the cotutelle arrangement.The Joint Administrators will share responsibility for ensuring that the conditions necessary for the continued operation of the candidate's cotutelle arrangement are satisfied.Should the progress of the cotutelle candidate fall below a satisfactory level, the Joint Administrators will consult. The Joint Administrators may recommend that: the candidature may continue with conditions; the candidate should transfer to an appropriate programme at one or the other university; or the candidature should terminate.\n\n\n\n\n                .register-container {\n\n                    display: flex;\n\n                    gap: 50px;   \n\n                }\n\n                .button--colour-primary-b {\n\n                    gap: 5px;   \n\n                }\n\n            "}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Digital_Communications_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Digital_Communications_Policy.html", "scope": "This policy applies to all staff employed by the University and all Approved Persons who are either approved to use a Digital Communications System associated with the University or to send a Digital Communication on behalf of the University.", "purpose": "This policy sets out the protocols and expectations regarding the use of Digital Communications: \nby staff and other relevant members of the University community; and/orvia University provided services, systems or devices.", "content": "Access / eligibilityAs members of the University community, individuals have access to various University Digital Communications Systems.

An affected employee can approach a first responder of their choice.\n3. Domestic Violence Leave\nAn employee's entitlement to apply for up to 10 days paid domestic violence leave annually, comes into effect at the time of appointment.An employee should treat domestic violence leave, as they would any other type of leave and seek approval beforehand (if that leave is anticipated) and if not, notify the University as soon as possible of their absence.If the employee has used their leave entitlement they can apply for additional leave.First responders or the employee's supervisor/manager can assist employees to apply for domestic violence leave.Requests for domestic violence leave require approval from the Director, Human Resources (HR Director).\n4. Variations to Working Arrangements\nEmployees affected by domestic violence have the right to request a short term (2 months or shorter) variation to their working conditions (for example, hours, days, and place of work) and/or how their contact details are managed.Requests require approval of the HR Director, who may seek line management input before making the decision to approve any requested variation.Requests must be made in writing but employees can ask a first responder, their supervisor/manager or any other person to assist them to write the request, or to write the request on their behalf.Requests must include the employee's name, place of work within the University, supervisor or manager's name and the variation they are seeking, including the start and end date for the changes.The University will try to accommodate requests whenever possible, but there are certain grounds on which an employer may refuse a request. If the University cannot accommodate the request, it will provide the employee with a clear written explanation as to why the request has been refused.\n5. The University's Response\nA response will be provided in writing as soon as possible and no later than 10 working days after receiving the request. The University will try to accommodate requests whenever it is reasonable and practicable to do so.\n6. Other ways that the University can Support Employees:\nDevelop a safety plan for the workplace, which may include working with the Proctor and/or Campus Cop (see safety planning in section 9 for full details).Re-route salary payments to a different bank account number.Connect employees with specialist domestic violence support agencies (see full contact details below in section 9).Support eligible employees to access free counselling or the employee assistance programme ( EAP )\n7. Privacy for Affected Employees\nAny disclosure from an employee will be treated with the strictest of confidence.Information will be shared on a strictly need-to-know basis to protect the employee's privacy as much as possible.Domestic violence leave will be coded by payroll in a way that does not identify it as domestic violence leave.\n8. Raising a Complaint\nIf the employee has made a request under this policy and the University has not responded within 10 working days of receiving the request or has refused a request without explanation or has refused a request and relied on grounds that it cannot rely on, then the employee can raise a complaint with the mediation service (or Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment), the Employment Relations Authority or the Labour Inspectorate.An employee can raise a personal grievance if they believe that they have been treated adversely by the University because they are, or are suspected to be, a person affected by domestic violence. Details on how to raise a personal grievance are set out in the University's employment agreements.Alternatively an employee may raise a complaint with the Human Rights Commission.\n9. Safety Planning\nEmployees can contact the Proctor to discuss concerns about safety on Campus.

Discrimination\n\u201cDiscrimination\u201d means conduct which:\nresults or is likely to result in less favourable treatment, or creates or is likely to create a less favourable environment, for any person or group of people than for another person or group of people in the same or similar circumstances by reason of any of the prohibited grounds set out in section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993; anddoes not fall within any of the relevant exceptions in Part II of the Human Rights Act 1993.The prohibited grounds of discrimination, based on section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993 are:sex, including pregnancy and childbirth;marital status;religious belief;ethical belief;colour;race;ethnic or national origins, which includes nationality and citizenship;disability;age;political opinion;employment status;family status;sexual orientation and gender identity.Discrimination may arise from official statements, actions, omissions, decisions or policies as well as from informal or personal statements or conduct. It may also be indirect, that is, have the effect of treating someone differently even if the discrimination is not explicit.Actions by the University constituting affirmative actions and policies to assist or advance a particular group are not discrimination. These actions and policies will be made public to the University community.\nd. Personal Harassment and Bullying\n\"Personal harassment\" means any objectionable or offensive behaviour (expressed or implied) by a member of the University community in relation to another member of the University community, which:\nintimidates, humiliates, undermines or dominates that other person;\u00a0\u00a0 orinvolves the use of abusive and/or threatening language, verbal or physical threats or any form of\u00a0\u00a0 physical assault.\nPersonal harassment may occur as a result of a significant one-time incident or as a result of more minor incidents occurring over a period of time.\nBullying is a form of personal harassment which is especially characterised by persistent and offensive, abusive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour (express or implied) which makes the recipient(s) feel upset, threatened, humiliated or vulnerable, undermines their self-confidence and/or causes them to suffer stress. It may include emotional abuse, isolation, economic abuse, abuse of authority, denying and blaming, coercion and threats that create a risk to an individual's health and safety.\ne. Abuse of Supervisory Authority\n\u201cAbuse of supervisory authority\u201d means conduct (express or implied), by a supervisor in relation to another member of the University community that exceeds the normal authority of a supervisor and which:\nintimidates, humiliates or undermines that other person by belittling them, or excessively, destructively or inappropriately criticising or reprimanding them, or excessively scrutinising their work; ormakes demands that are unreasonable or outside that other person's role or activity within the University; ormakes a demand to perform an action that is in breach of the principles of any policy of the University.\nFor the purpose of this section, an academic will be deemed to have supervisory authority over the students enrolled in her/his class.\nAn abuse of supervisory authority may occur in situations where a decision on benefits or opportunities of an academic, employment or other nature, has been influenced by considerations which are, or should be, irrelevant to the decision. This is considered to be a conflict of interest and is addressed in 3 below.\nf. Unethical Intimate Personal Relationships\nThe University strongly discourages, and staff should avoid entering into, an intimate personal relationship with any student of the University, particularly a student for whom they have responsibility or with whom they have involvement through any kind of University activity.\nAn intimate personal relationship between a member of staff and a student seriously risks taking advantage of the intrinsic trust, power and status differential implicit in the staff-to-student relationship.\nIntimate personal relationships are relationships characterised by a significant level of intimacy between the participants and include situations involving sexual activity of any kind.\nRelevant factors for the University to consider when determining whether a staff member has behaved unethically/inappropriately by entering into an intimate personal relationship with a student include, but are not limited to, the following:\nWhether there is an imbalance of power or statusIf the relationship is detrimental to the studentRisks unacceptable disruption to the student's study or work or their living environmentUndermines the trust and confidence the University has in the staff member\nIn addition, the University will consider whether the staff member gave careful, mature and sober consideration to all relevant ethical considerations, including those listed above, before and during the relationship.\nIf a staff member enters into a relationship with a student he/she is encouraged to seek advice immediately from the following people:\nMediatorHuman Resources Manager or AdvisorUnion\nStudents are encouraged to seek advice from the following:\nOUSA Support StaffMediator\nIf a relationship is considered to be not unethical but creates a conflict of interest under the provisions of the following clause, the staff member must follow the procedures set out in 4 below.\nSimilar considerations may arise in relationships between staff members, particularly where there is an imbalance of power or status between the staff members involved.\u00a0\u00a0The University may, after considering all relevant factors, determine a staff member has behaved unethically/inappropriately through involvement in an intimate personal relationship with another member of staff.\n3. Conflicts of Interest\nA conflict of interest may arise in a range of situations where the personal, academic or financial interests of an individual improperly affect or could improperly affect the carrying out of that person's or another person's duties within the University. The conflict of interest is inherent within the existence of particular relationships, whether staff-staff or staff-student, and is not dependent upon any specific action. In settings where there is a difference in power between people, such as staff and students at the University, the potential for harm is greater and special care needs to be taken to avoid conflicts of interest.\nFailure to disclose a conflict of interest, in accordance with this policy, may be considered a disciplinary matter by the University.\na. Conflicts of Interest arising between Staff members\nSituations may occur where staff members are working with family members or persons with whom they have a close personal relationships. The existence of close or intimate personal relationships with a member of staff should not constitute a bar to the employment or promotion of any individual. Where such relationships exist between staff members or with prospective staff members there may be situations where there is the potential to create a conflict of interest, such as in supervisory relationships and employment-related decisions. The staff member must follow the procedures set out in 4 below.\nb. Conflicts of interest arising between Staff and students.\nAny member of staff may find themselves in a situation where a family or personal relationship with a student gives rise to a conflict of interest. A family/personal relationship between a staff member and student has the potential for, or could be perceived as, compromising the fundamental duties inherent in teaching and learning. Staff members have a responsibility to students to assess their work fairly, objectively and consistently across the candidature for their particular subject/course. It follows that members of staff should not be involved in supervision or assessment of students with whom they have a family, or personal relationship. In any such situation the staff member must follow the procedures set out in 4 below.\n4. Procedures for dealing with conflict of interest and potential conflict of interest.\nStaff members must inform, verbally and in writing, the person to whom they normally report, (e.g. Head of Department, Supervisor) if a conflict of interest arises or where they are uncertain as to whether a particular situation gives rise to a conflict of interest.If the person to whom they normally report is also potentially involved in the conflict of interest, the staff member must report to that person's manager.The person to whom the matter is reported must ensure that processes are put in place to manage or remove the conflict of interest in the best way possible and in a transparent manner, and the staff member will be an active participant in the process. This includes written documentation of the processes put in place.All reasonable steps must be taken to advise those who may be affected by the measures put in place.After arrangements have been made to manage or remove a conflict of interest, the person to whom such a staff member would normally report (or this person's manager) is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the situation. The purpose of such monitoring is to ensure the wellbeing of those involved and to ensure any measures put in place are not unduly affecting the work of others.\nFor detail and procedures relating to other conflicts of interest, refer to the University of Otago Conflicts of Interest Policy.\nAppendix 2: Informal Processes\nThe University encourages informal resolution of problems where possible. In some circumstances informal processes will be inappropriate because of the seriousness of the issues or incidents concerned and it is appropriate to move directly to the formal process. A range of people, including a contact person, a mediator, a Human Resources Advisor or a supervisor, can help a person decide whether the matter is best addressed by an informal or a formal process.\nSome of the more common informal processes are described below.\na. Individuals Addressing the Issue Themselves\nWhere matters are less serious people should consider resolving an issue with the other person. This would involve the person raising their concerns directly with the other person, either with or without a support person present.\nThe people under Section 2 (Processes for Action under the Policy: Advice and Support) are available to provide advice, support and coaching to assist people who wish to pursue this resolution process.\nb. Management or Third Party Involvement\nWhere a person does not wish to address the issue directly themselves, or where this would not be appropriate, they may ask the person to whom they report to intervene or they may ask a third party to broach the issue with the person on their behalf. It would be normal for either of these processes to be followed by a direct discussion between the parties to re-establish a constructive working relationship.\nc. Mediation\nHow is mediation used?\nMediation is used in a variety of situations in the University.\nThe University employs a mediator who is available to mediate all types of situations, as requested by staff and students.If everyone is willing, mediation is one way that problems can be informally resolved. This option can be accessed by self-referral, via a contact person, or by referral from a manager or a head of department/school/service or by contacting the University Mediator.Any member of the University community may approach the University Mediator to request mediation for matters outside the Policy. If the University Mediator considers that the matter is suitable for mediation and the other person agrees to participate, mediation can be used to help resolve a variety of concerns.Because mediation is confidential, only aggregated general statistical information, such as the number of people using the service, whether they are staff or students, and general categories of the issues being dealt with are reported by the University Mediator to the University.\nWhat is mediation?\nMediation is a conversation between people with the help of the mediator; it is an informal and voluntary process, in which the participants identify the issues, generate options and consider alternatives in order to reach a mutually acceptable solution. It is confidential and non-disciplinary. Participants enter the process willingly and may withdraw at any time.\nThe participants to the mediation retain all decision-making power. The mediator does not act as an advocate, a support person or a decision-maker but as a neutral facilitator. Mediation is a non-judgmental process that does not result in a winner and a loser, but in an outcome which is acceptable to both participants.\nAll things said and any notes written in mediation are confidential. This ensures that the participants can trust the process as an opportunity to resolve issues in an open, frank and honest manner. They decide whether any agreement they reach is made available and, if so, to whom. Sometimes even the fact that mediation is occurring or has occurred will be kept private.\nSupport people may be present at the mediation.\nWhat are the advantages of mediation?\nMediation is confidential and private and can often provide the quickest and easiest way for people to sort out their differences. It is non-adversarial and promotes a co-operative problem solving approach. It provides participants with an equal opportunity to have their say in a non-threatening environment.\nMediation often produces the best outcome because the issues and concerns can be fully canvassed and the participants themselves determine the outcome. This helps to repair the working relationships that have broken down in a conflict. The process is future-focused with the aim being to find creative ways to meet the real needs and interests of everyone involved.\nIt can be very helpful to talk with a mediator confidentially about the appropriateness of mediation and to weigh up the alternatives to mediation. Mediation is most successful when people use it earlier rather than later, before their differences have become entrenched, but it can help even with long-standing and intractable problems.\nMore information on mediation is available at http://www.otago.ac.nz/mediation/\nAppendix 3: Formal Complaints\n1. Options for Formal Complaint\nThe options available under the Ethical Behaviour Policy Formal Complaint Process are:\nIf the person complained about is a student, the person complaining may make a formal written complaint to the University Proctor requesting that consideration be given to the matter being dealt with under the Code of Student Conduct.If the person complained about is not a student, the person complaining may make a formal written complaint to the Director of Human Resources.Where appropriate the University may accept complaints from third parties and/or may pursue investigations of its own if it becomes aware of alleged inappropriate behaviour.\n2. Confidentiality\nSubject to the requirements of the investigation or any legal disclosure requirements, everyone involved in a formal or informal investigation has:\nthe right to have information they disclose kept confidential;the duty to respect the rights of others to the maintenance of confidence;the right to have any limits of confidentiality explained to them.\n3. Ethical Behaviour Policy Formal Complaint Process\na. When the person complained about is a Student\nA written complaint may be made to the University Proctor.\nThe procedure and potential outcomes following a formal written complaint against a student are those established by the Code of Student Conduct as adopted by Council and found in the University Calendar.\nb. When the Person complained about is not a Student\nWhen someone chooses not to use informal processes or use of informal processes has failed to resolve the problem, they may make a formal written complaint to the Director of Human Resources.\nThe formal written complaint must be signed and dated by the person complaining and should contain the following:\nthe name of the person complained about as well as sufficient details outlining the issue complained about;the name of any person who may have witnessed the breach of the policy or to whom the complaint was first reported;the outcomes which the complainant believes would be appropriate to resolve the matter;information on whether any measures to protect the person complaining are necessary.\nThe failure to include information in the formal written complaint does not nullify the complaint. The person complaining shall be available for an interview for clarification of the formal written complaint if considered necessary by the person receiving the complaint.\nThere is no time limit for the making of a formal complaint, although long delays may inhibit the ability of people to recall facts accurately and may limit the ability of the investigator to reach any conclusions.\nIf it is considered that every reasonable effort to settle the matter informally has not occurred, then if appropriate, the people involved may be encouraged that this occurs before a formal proceeding commences.\nUpon receipt of a formal complaint, or where the University considers that there might be an issue that needs to be investigated, there are two options:\na preliminary investigation may be carried out to assess whether or not there is a prima facie case to be investigated, oran investigator may be appointed to investigate the matters raised in the complaint. An investigator is a person with delegated authority from the Director of Human Resources appointed to investigate a formal complaint.\nIn certain circumstances the Director of Human Resources may consider that it is necessary to suspend the person complained about for the duration of the investigation.\nThe investigator of the complaint must respect the principles of natural justice which include the right of the person complained about:\nto be advised of enough details of the formal complaint and the investigation to allow them to make an informed response;to be given an opportunity to provide an explanation and make representations, including having their witnesses heard;to be supported by or represented by the person of their choice; andto have the matter assessed by an impartial person.\nThe investigator's role is to investigate the complaint impartially and the investigator is required to:\nprovide the person complained about with a letter informing them that a complaint has been received, giving details of the allegations and defining the process of the investigation;receive any comments, either in person or in writing, to that letter;carry out such investigation as is necessary;advise the person complained about of their preliminary views as to those findings and as to the penalty, if any;receive and consider representations on those preliminary views;make and advise the person complained about of the final decision on the findings and as to the penalty, if any;advise the person complaining in confidence that a final decision has been made and give appropriate details."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Field_and_Off_Campus_Activities_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Field_and_Off_Campus_Activities_Policy.html", "scope": "This policy, and the associated guidelines, relate to teaching and research activities conducted off campus.\u00a0\u00a0It is applicable to all staff, students, visitors and volunteers who are involved in any University activity which meets the definition of urban, rural, remote, international or home/community based field activity.", "purpose": "This aim of this policy is to provide a safe environment as required by the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 for teaching and research activities conducted in the field and off campus locations.

Information and records management lifecycle\nThe University is required to comply with information and records management legislation and regulatory requirements. This includes the obligations set out in the Public Records Act 2005 (PRA) and any associated mandatory standards issued under the Act. The PRA requires that all University business information, records, and data is managed appropriately throughout its lifecycle, until it is archived or destroyed. The records information lifecycle spans from creation to disposal and is illustrated in the below diagram:\nDiagram 1: Information Lifecycle (ARMA International).\n2. Creation and maintenance of information and records\nAll information, data and records must be created in a complete and contextual manner which reliably documents the business activities of the organisation across all physical and digital operating environments.All information, data and records must be maintained appropriately in managed and approved storage solutions that are able to ensure their integrity, usability, and discoverability for their full life cycle.Information and records must not be created and maintained in any personal or private cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Google Docs, iCloud, or OneDrive.All information, data and records must be managed and protected commensurate with their value and information security classification.Information and records must be considered in all IT-enabled projects and services such as new business information system implementations, or improvements to existing systems, whereby the functionality and system requirements for information and records are defined and designed during the evaluation phase or process.\n3. Accessibility of information and records\nInformation and records must be collected and organised in a way that is easy to find and accessible over time for the purpose of discovery or investigation.Information and records must be secured and protected from corruption, damage, alteration, unauthorised access, use or disclosure, or premature disposal, and in accordance with the University's Cyber Security Framework.Information and records must be available as a corporate resource to all staff, except where the nature of the information requires restriction in accordance with the University's Access Framework for University of Otago Records,\n4. Retention and disposal of information and records\nAll University information, data, and records, including data in business information systems, must be retained for at least the minimum periods set out in the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA).Information and records must be identified so that where practicable retention periods are applied at the time of creation, either using system functionality or as an information management exercise undertaken outside of the system, and records of longer-term value and permanent retention are protected.Information and records must be disposed of in a timely and efficient manner when they are no longer legally or administratively required.Information and records that are of short-term, facilitative, or transitory in value can be disposed of as part of normal administrative practice.Information, data, and records must be retained in the system in which they were created, or reformatted (digitised) and /or migrated to an approved recordkeeping system as appropriate, so that digital or other technology dependent information and records are retained in an authentic and accessible form for as long as is required. Original hard copy information and records that are reformatted (digitised) must meet certain technical and quality assurance requirements before the destruction of the hard copy can take place. Please refer to the University's Digitisation of Records Procedures.Hard copy information and records that have been identified for permanent retention and that are no longer in current use or required administratively by the University must be transferred to the possession of the Hocken Library and the control of the Chief Archivist.\n5. Recordkeeping systems\nThe University uses a variety of IT storage systems and services that create and maintain digital information. How and where digital information is stored will affect their viability over time, and it is important to consider that digital information is likely to have a lifespan beyond the life of the system in which they are born.Not all IT storage systems and services in use at the University will be capable of performing as, or be designated, digital record keeping systems. An appropriate digital record keeping system will be capable of: Sustaining the information for as long as is required to support their legal retention (or capable of exporting the information, together with their relevant metadata, into a new system as and when required to support the required retention)Enabling the destruction of time-expired information in a systematic and auditable way in line with the University's legislative requirementsSupporting the management and monitoring of information and records including maintaining and retaining an auditable record of useAllowing privacy and security requirements for information and records to be managed and enforcedOrganising information appropriately and maintaining accessible and useable metadata to appropriate standardsVendor scrutiny and assessment to ensure widespread industry support and to avoid the system becoming obsolete and unsupportedIT storage systems and services that create and manage digital information but are not deemed capable of performing as, or be designated, a digital record keeping system will at a minimum need to be capable of allowing data migration and / or have the ability to export records and their metadata from one storage solution to another for the purpose of digital archiving.OURDrive, the University's EDRMS, shall be the University's system for managing public records from systems that are not capable of functioning as a digital recordkeeping system.Maintaining original paper source files, or printing and filing records, may be a suitable approach for some types of information. Physical recordkeeping systems will continue to be in operation as a supported record keeping tool until this process is superseded by digital equivalents.\n6. Staff responsibilities\nThe University's Information Framework provides general responsibilities associated with the management of information. Specific responsibilities relating to recordkeeping are as detailed in this section.The University Registrar is the designated Executive Sponsor and has strategic and executive responsibility for overseeing information and records management in the University.The Head of Corporate Records Services is responsible for: Providing advice, guidance, and training to staff on information and records management practices, policies, procedures, and systems.Maintaining communication and awareness with university staff on all matters relating to information and records management and promoting compliance.Leading the development and implementation of strategies and policies to enable sound information and records management practices.Assisting with the development of university recordkeeping and information systems as appropriate.Monitoring information and records management processes, procedures and systems as required, including the retention and disposal of university business information.Advising senior leadership of any risks associated with non-compliance and reporting on records and information management as appropriate.Coordinating the transfer of university information and records of permanent archival value to the Hocken Library and the control of the Chief Archivist.The Corporate Records Services team are responsible for providing business support for, and liaising with staff on, the promotion and implementation of information and records management best practice.

Intent\nThe University understands and acknowledges that the IP of graduate research students is underpinned by different circumstances, factors and relationships to the IP of staff. Generally speaking, the IP of graduate research students is created during, and directly related to, the course of their supervised research studies, while the IP of staff is created during the course of their employment at the University.\nTo protect the interests of both parties, it is essential for the student and the University, in partnership, to develop an appropriate Intellectual Property Agreement (IPA) that includes specific detail around University and student ownership of the IP, and which is tailored to the particular circumstances of the IP that the student has created or anticipates creating.\nThe University's view is that IP is produced with the assistance of the University through its staff and other resources, and the University accordingly has part-ownership of the IP. When the University does wish to exercise a claim on ownership of IP, it will enter into an agreement with the respective student, in accordance with this policy, to share the financial benefits that may arise. Should the University waive ownership, the student is free to make their own arrangements regarding the IP.\nStudents who are also staff, and whose staff roles do not include a research component, will be considered as students and this policy will apply \u2013 provided the IP in question has been created through their graduate research studies. The University of Otago Intellectual Property Rights Policy (for staff) will apply to those students who are also members of the academic staff and whose staff roles include a bona fide research component.\nWhere students are employed by a third (external) party within a research collaboration, the covering IPA must include specific detail around University, student and third party ownership of the IP.\nWhen using IP created by a graduate research student, a supervisor must declare both the supervisor's and the student's respective roles in creating the IP, particularly as these pertain to inventorship. A supervisor may not commercially exploit the IP created with a student without the express written agreement of both the student and the University.\n2. Copyright\nThe University does not claim copyright in work or material produced by students during, and directly related to, their course of studies and agrees that copyright in such work or material is owned by the students who produce it.\n3. Procedures\nThe following procedures facilitate the creation and protection of commercially valuable IP:\nGraduate research students are required to sign an IP declaration when enrolling as thesis students in eVision. This declaration is included together with the other declarations in the Consent and Declaration page in eVision. The declaration reads as follows, under the heading \u201cIntellectual Property Rights (for thesis students)\u201d: \u201cI undertake to abide by the University's Policy for Intellectual Property Rights of Graduate Research Students.\u201dWhen research activity generates or is likely to generate results that are novel and have potential commercial applicability, students should immediately advise the Director, Research and Enterprise, through their Head of Department. The Director, Research and Enterprise will make an assessment of commercial applicability, and, where appropriate, will initiate formal procedures to develop a mutually agreeable IPA, covering (among other things) the respective student and University ownership proportions of the IP and the term of the IPA. Any costs involved will be paid by the University in the first instance but will be recovered subsequently pursuant to section 4 below. Should no remuneration eventuate, the University will bear these costs.Any IP or idea or specific knowledge with potential commercial applicability that is already in existence at the commencement of the student's studies should be appropriately identified and registered in a statement of prior IP in the IPA. The purpose of this statement is to: accurately identify, and hence appropriately protect, any relevant IP the graduate research students is bringing with them to the research project; and/oridentify and protect the student's contribution in the creation of any subsequent IP so as to minimise the possibility of any conflicts of interest arising. When enrolling in eVision, graduate research students are also required to indicate whether or not they are bringing relevant IP to a research project. There is provision within eVision to upload a statement outlining any such IP.To safeguard any IP created within the University, it is important that students are cautious about publically sharing the results of research activity with potential commercial applicability so as to avoid inadvertent disclosure. (Inadvertent disclosure may occur via seminars, public talks, conference proceedings, posters, published articles, social media and so on.) It is in the best interests of the student and the University to not publicise the results of their research until the Director, Research and Enterprise has made a final assessment on commercial applicability and protection of any IP that may arise from the research activity. This decision shall be made expeditiously, so that publication or dissemination of the student's work is not unreasonably delayed.Students are advised to maintain full records of all documentation related to the creation of IP and to keep the University informed of their contact details.\n4. Distribution of income from intellectual property\nAny royalties or other remuneration received by the University as a consequence of licensing, selling, or otherwise dealing with IP which the University claims part-ownership of pursuant to this policy, shall be distributed in a manner consistent with this policy and the IPA entered into with the student (section 3(b)) \u2013 incorporating, where applicable, any associated statement of prior IP (section 3(c)).\nAs a general principle, the following distribution model will be used in determining the respective shares of the parties:\nFirstly, the University and the student shall recover the following expenses incurred in the protection and/or commercialisation of the IP.Secondly, the balance of the royalties or other remuneration shall then be divided between the student and the University based upon the percentage contribution of the student in creating the IP. This percentage contribution will be determined through a process of consultation and mediation between the student and the University, including the student's supervisor(s), with a view to reaching an agreement. It is the University's intent that the percentage contribution should represent an accurate, mutually agreeable, fair and reasonable figure. If required, an appropriate third party, agreeable to by the student and the University, may be requested to independently assess the relative value of contributions by the student and the University and to make a final and binding decision.The University's share of the royalties and other remuneration will be divided in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Intellectual Property Rights Policy.\n5. Cessation of study\nWhen a student who is entitled to payments pursuant to section 4(b) leaves the University upon completion of their studies, or dies while studying at the University, the payments will continue either to the student in the case of the former or to their estate in the case of the latter.\n6. Redress\nAny complaints related to the application of this policy, including the apportionment of income from the IP, should be made in writing to the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise).Complaints will be addressed in accordance with the relevant redress provisions in the respective IPA.\n7. External Research Contracts\nThe University may enter into contracts to provide research resources to external clients, including those in the commercial sector. Ownership of IP generated by such research, and distribution of income from that IP will be governed by the terms of the contracts, and sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 above will not apply.Students engaged in such contract research must: be fully informed in writing of the IP provisions that have been arranged;give their consent in writing to these arrangements prior to beginning their research; andcomply with all contract terms and conditions, including any confidentiality requirements and publication constraints.The University's \u201cExternally Sponsored Graduate Research Procedures\u201d should be consulted when study based on externally funded research is contemplated."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Intellectual_Property_Rights_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Intellectual_Property_Rights_Policy.html", "scope": "This Policy applies to all University staff who conduct research.", "purpose": "It is the University Council's desire to encourage and reward innovative research work within the University which leads to the creation of Intellectual Property.

Replacing IT Workstations\nIT Workstations and monitors will be replaced by ITS on a cycle as per the following table:CategoryLifespan\n\n           Laptop or desktops \n\n        \n\n           5 years \n\n        \n\n           Monitors \n\n        \n\n           10 years \n\n        \n\n           Tablets \n\n        \n\n           No specified lifespan \n\n        \n\n           IT workstation peripherals other than monitors \n\n        \n\n           No specified lifespan \n\n        Research environment equipment may be retained to operate with attached instrumentation for as long as required and may not be replaced on any particular cycle. The retention of this equipment may be subject to restrictions for security reasons.Once an IT Workstation reaches the agreed lifespan, it should be replaced within 3 months. If there is no specific lifespan, then the item will be replaced only when ITS deems it fails the \u2018Fit for purpose\u2019 criteria as specific in the IT Workstations Procedure.Please note that the lifespan may differ from the Depreciation Estimated Useful Life specified in the Assets Procedure.Evidence of continued need may be required.Requests will be considered to replace an IT Workstation that is still within its prescribed lifecycle with evidence that it no longer meets the specific needs and goals of the user.An IT Workstation (or components of an IT Workstation) will be replaced with either new or repurposed items as seen fit by ITS.Any IT Workstation that is replaced must be returned to ITS.\n5. Ownership of IT Workstations\nAll IT Workstations will be centrally owned and managed by ITS.Any IT Workstations that are no longer needed are to be returned to ITS.\n6. Purchasing of IT Workstations\nAll IT Workstations will be purchased by ITS.Exceptions for external research funding sources:Where research funding or other funding sources are available to support the purchasing of IT Workstations either fully or partially, these funds will be recovered by the central funding ledger.IT Workstations purchased by the University of Otago, regardless of budget source, will be centrally owned by ITS though it is recognised that in some cases, the funder retains ownership of the purchased equipment.If the research project is completed and there are no conditions from funders to retain equipment ownership, all purchased IT Workstations under that research project will be returned to the central pool for redeployment or disposal unless the research continues, and the IT Workstation is still being actively used for that research purpose.If the staff member leaves the project while the research project is still ongoing, the equipment will be redeployed to the replacement staff rather than being returned to the central pool.\n7.

Tangi take precedence over all other Hui, and indeed over all other activities. When death occurs in the district, other gatherings are interrupted or cancelled so that the body may lie on the marae.\nIn historical M\u0101ori society (pre 1830) koha was a matter of custom, in the form of k\u016bmara, fish, preserved birds, eels, or any other foods gathered from land or sea in their local areas. In contemporary society most koha is in the form of money.\nDefinition\n1. Present, gift, parting or final instruction.\n2. For the purposes of this policy, the University of Otago defines 'gift' as unconditional, spontaneous gift (cash, goods or kind) given or received for unsolicited services, as within tikanga M\u0101ori. Koha will:\nbe in the form of cash;be paid to external person(s) or non-profit community groups who provide support, or undertake a one-off activity and expect non-payment for such activity or support in return;not be given in lieu of salary or as a payment for service(s) provided;generally not be given by the University to University of Otago employees.\n1. Determining University Payments of Koha\na. Procedure for determining University representation at cultural gathering (tangi, hui etc.)\nWhere staff attend a cultural gathering representing the University, the University will provide a contribution towards koha.\nTherefore:\nThe first point to consider is whether staff will attend in a personal capacity or whether they will attend as formal University representative(s). If there is an issue in determining mana or standing of the cultural gathering, advice should be sought from Divisional Heads and/or Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development to assist in the determination. If it is deemed that attendance will be in a personal capacity, then any koha will be the responsibility of the staff member(s) concerned.Notification should be made by the staff member(s) of the Hui (including tangi), to their Manager/Supervisor, where possible, before attending the cultural gathering. The staff member(s) will also provide him/her with details of the purpose of the gathering (kaupapa, mate - deceased person etc.) in particular, advice will be sought on: Importance of the event to the University.In relation to tangi: the deceased having mana (wisdom, importance); and/orsignificance and/or prominence within the community; and/orprominence and/or standing in the local or national tertiary sector; and/orassociation with the University of Otago.If the University is to be formally represented consideration will have to be given to the level of staff who should attend. In some cases senior University representation (i.e. Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor etc.) will be required. If there is difficulty in determining the level of representation, the Manager/Supervisor should contact the Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development to assist in deciding this.When formally represented, the University will provide koha, which is an unconditional gift. Koha will always be in the form of cash and the Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development will provide advice on the size of contribution.\nb. Other circumstances where koha payment may be made\nKoha as referred to in definitions on page one, may be paid to external non-profit community groups and individuals (non-University employees) in certain circumstances. This may include:\nacknowledging an individual or non-profit community group who support a conference opening;acknowledging an individual or non-profit community group who support an opening and/or blessing of a new building;where an individual or non-profit community group attend to support/lead a mihi whakatau (welcome) or poroporoaki (farewell or closing of a hui);where prominent guests are welcomed by mana whenua (people of the local area) at the request of the University of Otago.\n2. Procedure for Payment of Koha\na. Authorisation procedure for payment(s) of koha\nNotification should be made by the staff member to their Manager/Supervisor prior to payment, of the intention to provide a koha payment. The staff member will also provide him/her with: a brief explanation of the reason for the koha payment; andthe date of the event;details of who the payment will be made to;details of the amount of the proposed koha payment.Manager/Supervisor to make recommendation to Divisional Head for the payment of koha.The payment of koha, as defined within this policy will be approved by Divisional Head. If there is difficulty in determining whether such a koha payment is in line with this policy, the Manager/Supervisor and/or Divisional Head should contact the Director, Office of M\u0101ori Development to assist in any determination.\nb. Administration Procedures for payment(s) of koha\nFollowing the approval for koha, as described above, the staff member should email Revenue Management, Finance Services, Shared Services, a copy of documentation as detailed in 2A (i), along with the authorisation of their Divisional Head.\nRevenue Management, Finance Services, Shared Services, will arrange for the cash to be collected.\nAll payments determined as koha under this policy will not be liable for GST, FBT or PAYE, unless paid to staff or former staff (where advice should be sought from the Financial Controller, Financial Services)."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Laboratory_Animal_Allergy_and_Zoonosis_Prevention_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Laboratory_Animal_Allergy_and_Zoonosis_Prevention_Policy.html", "scope": "All University work locations where animals are involved in research and teaching, including departmental laboratories and animal facilities.", "purpose": "To minimise the likelihood of exposure to animal allergens and zoonotic disease agents via animal handling, and to effectively manage any exposure to minimise possible harm. \nThe University will take all practicable steps to control hazardous exposure to laboratory animal allergens and zoonotic disease agents to protect the health of staff, students, and others who may be at risk of exposure.All work relating to the holding and use of animals at the University will be managed in accordance with the laboratory animal allergy and zoonotic disease prevention guidelines governing the work.The University operates a health surveillance programme for all persons working within animal facilities or departmental laboratories where animals are used.\u00a0\u00a0This surveillance programme will be used to enable the early identification of anyone developing allergic problems or at risk of contracting a zoonotic disease.\u00a0\u00a0Additional controls will be introduced to protect these individuals from disease progression.The University will make reasonable efforts to re-deploy to other work areas any staff with laboratory animal allergy or identified to be at a higher risk of contracting a zoonotic disease, where additional controls have been ineffective in preventing the development of allergic response or zoonotic disease.", "content": "1.

The empirical evidence that has been published in the last thirty years not only supports the idea that being brought up speaking two or more languages is definitely not a disadvantage, but that there are probably some subtle advantages, as well as the major benefit of being able to speak two languages and being comfortable in two cultures.\nSustainable bilingualism and biculturalism cannot be maintained on the basis of open and unlimited interaction between minorities and majorities. Te reo M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori language), like all minority languages, requires special measures to ensure its survival as a language used in a wide range of contexts and domains with an increasing number of fluent speakers. In order to promote te reo M\u0101ori use by staff and students, incentives need to be introduced to encourage this. 1\nThe importance of the language is reflected in the waiata composed for the Ng\u0101i Tahu reo r\u016bmaki ( M\u0101ori language immersion) hui at R\u0101paki marae in January 1998.\n He taoka te reo He kura pounamu Iti kahuraki M\u0101pihi maurea \nThe language is a treasure Like a greenstone pendant That which I strive to possess And carry with me always\nSir James Henare's comments on the importance of te reo M\u0101ori are also worth repeating.\nThe language is the core of our M\u0101ori culture and mana.

Then, I ask our own people who are we?...Therefore the taonga, our M\u0101ori language, as far as our people are concerned, is the very soul of the M\u0101ori people.2\nOne of the provisions in the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987 is that te reo M\u0101ori is an official language of New Zealand.\n3. M\u0101ori language to be an official language of New Zealand \u2013 The M\u0101ori language is hereby declared to be an official language of New Zealand. 3\nSince 1997 the Government has had a M\u0101ori Language Strategy which government departments are currently implementing.\nThis University policy seeks to give effect to the M\u0101ori Language Act 1987 and is consistent with the University's Strategic Direction to 2005.

It accepts all dialects of te reo M\u0101ori, reflecting the fact that it is a national rather than a regional university.\nPrinciple 4\nThe University will recognise the rangatiratanga and mana of mana/tangata whenua, especially Ng\u0101i Tahu, along with any existing or future agreements with such parties, which may impact on such relationships.\nPrinciple 5\nThe University will promote and encourage M\u0101ori culture.\nObjectives\nTo increase the number of people who speak te reo M\u0101ori by increasing their opportunities to learn the language.To improve the proficiency levels of people in speaking, listening, reading and writing te reo M\u0101ori.To increase the opportunities to use te reo M\u0101ori by increasing the number of situations where te reo M\u0101ori can be used.To foster amongst M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori positive attitudes towards and positive values about te reo M\u0101ori so that M\u0101ori-English bilingualism becomes a valued part of the University community and of New Zealand society. 5\nProcedures for Student Assessment in Te Reo M\u0101ori\nThe following procedures should be used for student assessment in te reo M\u0101ori:\nIn papers not taught in te reo M\u0101ori, candidates who intend to present all or part of an examination or piece of course work in te reo M\u0101ori are required to give notice of their intention to do so in writing6. They should write to the Head, Student Experience, Academic Services who will notify the Head of the Department in which the paper is offered. This notice of intention is necessary to allow the University the time to make suitable arrangements for marking including, when necessary, translation and external assessment. This notice should be given at the beginning of the paper and within the first three weeks of the semester in which the paper is taught.Every effort should be made by the Head of Department to have the examination or piece of work marked by a person qualified to assess the work in te reo M\u0101ori. This should be the examiner for the course if he/she is considered by the Head of Department, in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, to be linguistically competent to do so.If the examiner of the relevant paper is not competent to assess in te reo M\u0101ori, a co-examiner, competent in both the subject under examination and in te reo M\u0101ori, may be appointed by the Head of Department in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, and in agreement with the appropriate chief examiner, to conduct the assessment of work presented in te reo M\u0101ori. The University should take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances (taking into account the period of notice given and the time-frame of the assessment process) to appoint a suitable co-examiner from within or from outside the University. The objectives stated in the course outline of the paper concerned should be given to the marker of the script written in te reo M\u0101ori.If a suitable person is not available to assess the work in te reo M\u0101ori, a translator should be appointed by the Head of Department, in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, and in agreement with the appropriate chief examiner. The translator should be sent a photocopy of the original with the student's name removed. In the translation the translator should be asked not to correct errorsof content nor to make embellishments. However, ambiguities should be pointed out to the examiner. Where necessary, the examiner may seek clarification of the translation of the paper from the translator, but contact between the student and translator is prohibited. The assessment should be carried out by the course examiner on the basis of the translation.Resorting to translation of work or examinations should be made only when reasonable efforts to find an examiner capable of assessing the work in its original language have been exhausted. The Head of Department and Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the translator is competent in the relevant subject under examination or for which work has been prepared. The decision of the Head of Department and Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies regarding the linguistic competence of the translator appointed should be treated as final, subject to the provisions for reconsideration of the final grade.It is suggested that the translator should correct any errors of spelling and grammar on the photocopy of an assignment in M\u0101ori with a brief report to the course convenor and the student regarding the quality and clarity of the M\u0101ori used by the student.Where a candidate has given notice in writing of the intention to present material in Te Reo M\u0101ori, he or she should be informed by the Head of Department as soon as is reasonably possible whether or not the assessment will be based on translation.The University should do its best to make the results of an item of course work or an examination presented in Te Reo M\u0101ori available to the candidate within the normal time-frame. The process of assessment in such cases, particularly if it includes translation, may result in delays in the return of course work or in the publication of results.If the course work and/or examination script is to be subject to external assessment and translation is required, the Head of Department, in consultation with Te Tumu, School of M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indigenous Studies, should appoint the translator.When coursework or an examination script is returned to a student, any translation used should also be returned.When oral work is assessable, the same principles should apply as for written work. However, practicalities may necessitate more restrictive policy details, such as a limitation on the use of Te Reo M\u0101ori where oral work involves interaction with other candidates who do not understand Te Reo M\u0101ori.Any complaint about a decision regarding linguistic or subject competence made under the provisions of paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 shall be through the appropriate procedures such as via the Head of Department, Academic Dean of a Division, Pro Vice-Chancellor or in some cases, Student Experience, Shared Services. In such cases the University's Academic Grievance Procedures should be consulted.\nPromotion of M\u0101ori Culture\nThe University acknowledges Ng\u0101i Tahu as the mana whenua of its two South Island campuses. It also acknowledges as tangata whenua Ng\u0101ti Toa and Te \u0101ti Awa at the Wellington campus and Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua at the Auckland campus. These iwi are the arbiters of cultural practices on their campuses. Senate will consult with the Treaty of Waitangi Committee on relevant matters of cultural practice involving the University. By including M\u0101ori cultural practices in University activities, not only will the institution be acknowledging the bicultural nature of New Zealand, but it will also be making the University a more friendly place for M\u0101ori staff and students.\nEvery language is tied closely to the culture of the people who speak it. The University supports the use of appropriate M\u0101ori cultural practices. Situations where these procedures could be used include:\nthe welcoming of visitors, especially when they include M\u0101ori;interviewing prospective employees, especially when they are M\u0101ori;the opening of new buildings; andmeetings and conferences\nTraining in how to use Te Reo M\u0101ori in such situations is offered through HEDC. The University's M\u0101ori Affairs Adviser is also available for advice on M\u0101ori cultural practices.\n\nFootnotes\nFishman, J.A. 1980.

The Policy does not apply to gifts given by the University to University employees.", "purpose": "In keeping with the University's commitment to strengthening its ties with Pacific communities both within New Zealand and in the Pacific region, this policy seeks to provide clarity around gifting practices and procedures for University representatives interacting with Pacific peoples in Pacific cultural contexts. \nProcedure for determining University representation at Pacific cultural gatherings where gifting may be appropriate (funerals, fono, etc.)Gifting is an integral part of many Pacific cultures and occupies a position similar to that of koha with M\u0101ori culture. Gifting occurs in a number of contexts, including interactions with/between Pacific individuals, churches, groups, organisations, and communities. Gifting is understood and practised as a reciprocal gesture (money, vouchers or payment in kind) whereby an unconditional gift is bestowed upon a recipient who has neither stipulated that it be given, nor has any expectation of receiving it. Reciprocity and unconditionality are implicit in Pacific gifting.Where staff or students are planning to attend a Pacific cultural gathering at which they consider University representation may be appropriate, they should notify their Manager/Supervisor/Head of Department before attending the event.In considering whether University representation is appropriate, the Manager/Supervisor/Head of Department shall consider the importance of the event to the University. In the case of a funeral, they may consider with respect to the deceased significance and/or prominence within the community;prominence and/or standing in the local or national tertiary sector; and/orassociation with the University of Otago.If the University is to be formally represented, consideration shall be given to the level of staff and/or students who should attend. In some cases senior University representation (i.e. Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, etc.) will be required.If there is difficulty determining the standing, and significance to the University, of the gathering, or the appropriate level of representation, advice should be sought from Divisional Pacific Leaders and/or the Pacific Development Office.If it is deemed that attendance by staff and/or students will be in a personal capacity, then any gift will be the responsibility of the staff/students concerned.Other circumstances where gifting may be appropriateGifts, as defined in clauses 4 and 5, may be given to external Pacific non-profit community groups and individuals (non-University employees) in certain circumstances. This may include acknowledging a Pacific individual, family or non-profit community group who: support/lead a University welcome or farewell, or the opening or closing of a conference or fono;directly support University research projects (through the provision of culture-specific knowledge and/or ethnicity-specific data);directly support University teaching and learning (through the provision of culture-specific knowledge, including hosting students on cultural immersion programmes);give support at a University-organised event such as the opening and/or blessing of a new building;participate where prominent Pacific guests are welcomed by local Pacific communities at the request of the University of Otago.Receive and host the University as part of a University project such as a repatriation.Authorisation procedure for giftingNotification should be made by the staff member to their Manager/Supervisor prior to gifting, of the intention to provide a gift. The staff member will fill out a Sensitive Expenditure Gift Approval Form providing: brief explanation of the reason for the gift; andthe date of the event;details of who the gift will be made to;details of the nature/amount of the proposed gift (i.e. whether cash, voucher or in-kind gift).The Manager/Supervisor will then make a recommendation, for the presentation of a gift, to their Divisional Head who may approve the gift if it is consistent with this policy.In the cause of large projects which require gifting to multiple community groups, advice should be sought from the Pacific Development Office as to who should be gifted and the amount.Administration procedures for giftsCash giftsFollowing approval of the gift, as described above, the staff member should email Revenue Management, Finance Services, a copy of documentation as detailed in 3(a), along with the authorisation of their Divisional Head.Revenue Management, Finance Services will arrange for the cash to be collected.In accordance with the Purchase Card Policy and Purchase Card Procedure, under certain circumstances the Purchase Card cash advance facility can be used for Pacific Gifting and Koha.

Gifting occurs in a number of contexts, including interactions with/between Pacific individuals, churches, groups, organisations, and communities. Gifting is understood and practised as a reciprocal gesture (money, vouchers or payment in kind) whereby an unconditional gift is bestowed upon a recipient who has neither stipulated that it be given, nor has any expectation of receiving it. Reciprocity and unconditionality are implicit in Pacific gifting.Where staff or students are planning to attend a Pacific cultural gathering at which they consider University representation may be appropriate, they should notify their Manager/Supervisor/Head of Department before attending the event.In considering whether University representation is appropriate, the Manager/Supervisor/Head of Department shall consider the importance of the event to the University. In the case of a funeral, they may consider with respect to the deceased significance and/or prominence within the community;prominence and/or standing in the local or national tertiary sector; and/orassociation with the University of Otago.If the University is to be formally represented, consideration shall be given to the level of staff and/or students who should attend. In some cases senior University representation (i.e. Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, etc.) will be required.If there is difficulty determining the standing, and significance to the University, of the gathering, or the appropriate level of representation, advice should be sought from Divisional Pacific Leaders and/or the Pacific Development Office.If it is deemed that attendance by staff and/or students will be in a personal capacity, then any gift will be the responsibility of the staff/students concerned.Other circumstances where gifting may be appropriateGifts, as defined in clauses 4 and 5, may be given to external Pacific non-profit community groups and individuals (non-University employees) in certain circumstances. This may include acknowledging a Pacific individual, family or non-profit community group who: support/lead a University welcome or farewell, or the opening or closing of a conference or fono;directly support University research projects (through the provision of culture-specific knowledge and/or ethnicity-specific data);directly support University teaching and learning (through the provision of culture-specific knowledge, including hosting students on cultural immersion programmes);give support at a University-organised event such as the opening and/or blessing of a new building;participate where prominent Pacific guests are welcomed by local Pacific communities at the request of the University of Otago.Receive and host the University as part of a University project such as a repatriation.Authorisation procedure for giftingNotification should be made by the staff member to their Manager/Supervisor prior to gifting, of the intention to provide a gift. The staff member will fill out a Sensitive Expenditure Gift Approval Form providing: brief explanation of the reason for the gift; andthe date of the event;details of who the gift will be made to;details of the nature/amount of the proposed gift (i.e. whether cash, voucher or in-kind gift).The Manager/Supervisor will then make a recommendation, for the presentation of a gift, to their Divisional Head who may approve the gift if it is consistent with this policy.In the cause of large projects which require gifting to multiple community groups, advice should be sought from the Pacific Development Office as to who should be gifted and the amount.Administration procedures for giftsCash giftsFollowing approval of the gift, as described above, the staff member should email Revenue Management, Finance Services, a copy of documentation as detailed in 3(a), along with the authorisation of their Divisional Head.Revenue Management, Finance Services will arrange for the cash to be collected.In accordance with the Purchase Card Policy and Purchase Card Procedure, under certain circumstances the Purchase Card cash advance facility can be used for Pacific Gifting and Koha.

Furthermore, should the Pro Vice-Chancellor or Internationalisation Committee require, the proposal may be forwarded to the Board of Undergraduate Studies or Board of Graduate Studies for further consideration.Once established, all Articulation Agreements will undergo regular review. A process, similar to that of the Annual Progress Reports for new papers/programmes, will be applied as a measure of a quality control. Furthermore, articulation agreements should be reviewed whenever there is significant change by either institution. However, minor changes, e.g. a change in paper title, may simply be updated in Schedule 1 of the Agreement and communicated accordingly between the partners. The International Office should be advised whenever there is a change to an Agreement.Articulation Agreements may be formed for an Undergraduate or Postgraduate programme, with adherence to the rules and regulations of the University of Otago.The wording of a new partnership agreement is developed through negotiation with the partner(s).Following approval of the Proposal by Council, the formal partnership agreement will be prepared for the Vice-Chancellor (or delegated nominee) to sign, with support from relevant staff in the International Office.

Changes to role\nIf a staff member's position changes and/or is re-evaluated at a new level during the Review period, the following applies;i.if the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred before 1 August, the staff member's performance is reviewed against the requirements for the new or changed role.ii.If the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred after 1 August, the staff member's performance is reviewed against the old position description.\n5.Assessment\nOutcomes and Competencies are the key tools for assessment of performance and defining areas for development.Outcomes An outcome is what has been achieved as assessed against a predetermined set of tasks, functions or responsibilities. They may be sourced from a range of areas including job descriptions, PDR meetings, policies, or practices.Expected outcomes are what staff are expected to achieve during a Review period.Competencies The competencies focus on the way or manner in which the outcomes can be achieved.The University has 8 generic competencies:Knowledge and SkillsTeamwork and Co-operationOrganisation, Planning and Self-ManagementProblem Solving / Decision MakingService to CustomersInitiative and InnovationLeadership and People ManagementNg\u0101 Taonga Tuku Iho / Language and CultureEach competency is made up of a series of descriptors of performance or behaviour. These are described in detail in Appendix 1 \u2013 Competencies.For the purposes of the PDR it is expected that: The majority of the competencies will apply when describing the level of staff performance. Some may be of more significance depending on the role.Not all the competency descriptors would apply to each position or to a particular outcome.\n6. Performance levels within competencies\nWithin each competency there are five performance levels:OutstandingExceeds ExpectationsFully CompetentWorking Satisfactorily towards Full CompetenceRequires ImprovementDefinitions of performance levelsOutstanding Consistently achieves all their outcomes as described in the \u201coutstanding\u201d performance descriptors. The Key outcomes are recognised as exceeding the normal expectations for the role. Exceeds Expectations Achieves some outcomes that are recognised to be beyond the requirements of the role as described in the \u201coutstanding\u201d performance descriptors for key competencies, and balanced with outcomes achieved at the \u201cfully competent\u201d level for other competencies. Fully Competent Achieves all expected outcomes to a high standard as described in the \u201cfully competent\u201d performance descriptors. Performance assessed at this level is considered as meeting normal expectations for the role. Working Satisfactorily toward Full Competence Achieves some expected outcomes and demonstrates full competence in some areas as described in the \u201cworking satisfactorily towards full competence\u201d performance descriptors. Development is required in some areas of the role but progress towards \u201cfully competent\u201d is evident. Requires Improvement Does not achieve some expected outcomes; performance is as described in the \u201crequires improvement\u201d performance descriptors. Development is required in some key areas of the role but improvement is not evident Exceeds Expectations DescriptorsUnlike the other levels, Exceeds Expectations does not have a set of descriptors of the performance level (refer Appendix 1). This level is met by demonstrating all the relevant descriptors in the Fully Competent performance level and some of the relevant descriptors in the Outstanding performance level. The proportion of outstanding outcomes will increase as the staff member progresses up the scale.The level of Fully CompetentThe expectation is that all staff will attain the level of Fully Competent. They will do this by progressing through the Appointment steps within the Appointment range. The number of Appointment steps will vary depending on the level of Appointment and initial placement within that range.Once the level of Fully Competent is achieved it is expected that this will become the minimum standard of performance.Changes in Assessment across ReviewsIt may not always be possible to sustain an assessment at the higher levels of Exceeds Expectations and Outstanding over time. Therefore, there may be movement within the levels of Fully Competent, Exceeds Expectations and Outstanding over time, e.g. someone assessed as Outstanding one year may be assessed as Exceeds Expectations or Fully Competent the following year.Service to the University Community and/or Service to the Wider CommunityService to the University and wider community is not a requirement for professional staff, but a number of staff are involved in activities that benefit the University, and this kind of contribution needs to be acknowledged and valued. It is an additional positive factor which should be taken into consideration when assessing the level of performance.Service can cover a very wide range of areas and includes all activities which are voluntary and not part of the job description. To be considered, the activities must benefit the University and should not detract from the staff member's ability to do their job. Listed below are examples of the types of activities that could be considered as community service: Fostering positive links and better understanding between the University and groups such as local papatipu r\u016bnanga, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu and ng\u0101 Iwi M\u0101ori;Membership of University committees such as the Operational Health and Safety Committee, or divisional and departmental committees;Supporting a professional association or staff grouping e.g. the Technicians' Forum, Staff Women's Caucus etc;Acting as a contact person under the Ethical Behaviour Policy.Territorial or St Johns Ambulance serviceA lack of relevant community service is not a negative factor as it is essentially a voluntary activity and not everyone has the opportunity to contribute in this way.\n7. Parties involved in the PDR\nThe person who manages the staff member's work directly will normally be the main Reviewer.A Reviewer should have responsibility for a manageable number of Reviewees. If the number of reviewees exceeds what is reasonably manageable then alternatives must be considered. Consideration may include delegating, shared or assisted reviews, or other alternative ways for completing the PDR .It may be appropriate for the Reviewer to be supported by a more senior manager in completing the PDR .In some situations, it may be appropriate to invite someone with additional knowledge about the performance to participate in or contribute to the Review. This should be discussed in advance of a Review meeting.\n8. Support People in the PDR review\nEither party has the opportunity to bring a support person to the Review meeting. This could be, for example, a colleague, wh\u0101nau support or a union representative. There may be a variety of reasons why a staff member would like a support person.If a support person is to be involved, the parties participating in the Review should discuss and clarify in advance what their role in the meeting will be. For example, a support person might provide support but not speak during the session, or they may provide prompts to help provide information.\n9. The formal PDR meeting\nThe formal PDR must be completed before 31 October. The requirements for the Review meeting are:The Reviewer will give the Reviewee at least one week's notice of the Review meeting, offer the opportunity to bring a support person, and ensure adequate opportunity to prepare.The Reviewer should arrange a suitable place for the PDR meeting.In the Review meeting, the parties will discuss the staff member's performance in terms of expected outcomes and competencies.The parties will discuss the overall assessment of the staff member's performance. The Reviewer will consider all the information discussed at the meeting before finalising the decision about the overall assessment of performance.If the Reviewer believes that more information is needed before a decision can be reached, a second meeting can be arranged and plans made to obtain the necessary information.A work and development plan will be developed for the next year.The parties will set regular dates for progress reviews over the next 12 months.The Reviewer will write up the PDR form.The Head, if not the Reviewer, and the staff member have an opportunity to make additional comments in the PDR Form.The completed form will then be signed by all parties and copied to the Reviewer, the staff member and the departmental personnel file. This should be completed by the end of November.\n10. Salary review\nThe standard salary increase will depend on the specific scale that applies to a position.\u00a0\u00a0For example, for roles on Scale 1 the standard Appointment Range salary increase is one step and in the Merit Range three steps in Levels 1-3 and four steps in Levels 4-8.NOTE: for staff on Scale 1: As of 1 February 2023, eligible staff on Scale 1 will automatically receive a Standard increase if they are eligible for a PDR, and not on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), or part of a formal process, or at the top of the scale or off the scale.For all other salary scales, please refer to the criteria for movement relevant to each scale.If a staff member\u2019s performance is assessed as Requires Improvement, appropriate support and a development plan will be put in place to assist with an improvement in performance.Accelerated Salary IncreasesAn Accelerated Increase is two steps and may be considered in either range when a performance level of Exceeds Expectations or Outstanding is given. Accelerated Increases are reserved for exceptional performance.Reviewers will need to submit a case for consideration and approval by the Divisional Head. Approved Accelerated Increases will need to be sent to the HR Promotions and Remuneration team for review and processing.Management Band IncreasesThe Management Band scales are set out in ranges. The criteria and level of salary increases are outlined in the Management PDR Guidelines.\n11. Support during the PDR process\nFor the Review to be successful, it is important that the parties maintain a respectful and constructive working relationship. A range of support is available to assist with the process including providing advice on staff development opportunities or skills-based training, development plans and objective setting.Support is available at any time. Working on the principle that there should be \u201cno surprises\u201d during the formal PDR , it is better that the support options are called on when the need is first identified \u2013 this is more likely to be during one of the progress meetings prior to the formal PDR .People available to provide advice and support at any stage include, but are not limited to, colleagues, senior staff in your Division, the Divisional HR Managers, the Head of Organisational Development, the Equity Manager, Union Representatives and the University Mediator. These staff may be able to help directly or suggest other people or options. These resources are available to all campuses.\n12. What to do if a disagreement should arise\nIf a disagreement should arise between the parties during the Review, parties will be encouraged to resolve it themselves using the options outlined in section 11 as this allows them to keep control of how they manage their working relationship.If, at the end of the process, there is a significant ongoing disagreement that is likely to take a medium to long term period to resolve, it is recommended that staff invite an appropriate third party to facilitate a constructive discussion to help both parties reach an agreement. This could be any person that both parties believe has the knowledge and personal skills to help resolve the disagreement and who is willing to assist in this way. Support and facilitation mechanisms available include your Manager, the Divisional HR Managers, the Head of Organisational Development, the Equity Manager, Union Representatives and the University Mediator.\n13. Appeal\nThe outcome of the PDR Review can only be appealed on the grounds that the PDR process has not been followed and that the failure to do so affected the outcome of the Review.An appeal to the Director Human Resources may be lodged by either the staff member or their Reviewer.The deadline for appeals is the date set by the University but will be no later than the University's last working day of the calendar year.Staff should be informed of the outcome of their appeal within a month of lodging the appeal. If there is any delay in informing staff of the outcome of their PDR salary Review, either party may apply for the appeal deadline to be extended.The Director, Human Resources will decide on how the appeal will be considered and make the final decision on the outcome.If the appeal is upheld, the parties will be advised of the outcome and instructed on the actions that need to be taken. This may require that the process is repeated with appropriate mentoring and supervision.\nAppendix 1: Competency criteria\n The University of Otago is committed to and will recognise bicultural competencies.

Amendment of policy documents\nEditorial amendments, which do not alter the meaning or intent of a policy document, may be approved by the Registrar and Secretary to the Council or the Chair of the Policy Management Group or their delegate. Editorial amendments include formatting changes, updates to roles, titles, names or contact information, or correction of cross-references or errors.Administrative amendments, which clearly follow from other authorised University changes or from changes to legislation or other binding external rules, may be approved by the Registrar and Secretary to the Council or their delegate.Minor amendments, which do not significantly alter the effect, responsibility, meaning or intent of a Policy Document, may be approved by the Registrar and Secretary to the Council/General Counsel or the Policy Management Group.Major amendments, which significantly alter the effect, responsibility, meaning or intent of a Policy Document, are subject to the full approval process as described in clause 3.The Secretary of the Policy Management Group is responsible for ensuring that the last approved revision of a Policy Document is recorded in the Policy Library and also managing an archive of all previous Policy Document versions.\n5. Review of policy documents\nThe Responsible Officer is responsible for initiating and coordinating reviews, consulting relevant parties as appropriate, and considering: whether the Policy Document is still requiredwhether the Policy Document is achieving its intended purposewhether content is current, accurate and well understoodwhether the Policy Document could be improved.Policy documents are to be reviewed two calendar years from the date they first take effect and every five years after that. However, an alternative review cycle may be approved as part of the overall approval of a Policy Documentwhere major amendments (or other significant revisions) are required outside of the standard timeframe, the Sponsor or Responsible Officer may elect to conduct a full review at that timethe Policy Management Group may approve deferral of a scheduled review at the request of the Responsible Officer, who must provide a case for the deferral and first gain the endorsement of the Policy Document's Sponsor.The outcome of the review shall be communicated to the Policy Management Group, who may approve or endorse recommended amendments as per clause 4.Where it is recommended that a Policy Document is no longer required, the Policy Management Group may: approve the deletion where it is clear that a University-level policy document on the relevant matter is no longer required and that appropriate consultation has taken placereject the deletion of the Policy Document, orrefer the matter to the Approval Body for a final decision."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Privacy_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Privacy_Policy.html", "scope": "All members of the University Community who have access to personal information.

Good privacy practice involves considerations of ethics, fairness, and proportionality. Privacy is a human right, and the University strives to respect that.\nGlobal privacy laws take a principles-based approach, allowing the University to collect, use and share personal information in the ways required to run our business. The principles of this policy reflect the requirements of most privacy laws, and best practice ethical considerations. The focus of this policy is on the Privacy Act, but where other laws (such as the GDPR and PIPL ) require specific steps to be taken, these are noted.\nWhere the University is required by another law \u2013 such as the Education and Training Act 2020 \u2013 to collect, use or disclose personal information in a particular way, this requirement will override the Privacy Act, and the relevant processing of personal information will not generally be required to comply with the information privacy principles.\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Collection of personal information\nScope of collection\nPersonal information should only be collected if it is necessary for a lawful purpose that is directly connected with any of the University\u2019s lawful functions. At a high level, our lawful purposes include (but are not limited to): considering applications for admission to, or employment with, the Universityadministering programmes of studyconducting academic researchmanaging staff and ensuring the health and safety of students and staff members, andmeeting the University\u2019s reporting requirements.Where a process or system can operate without the collection of personal information, or without the need to identify a data subject, the University may not require the individual\u2019s identifying information.Personal information should be collected from the data subject directly, unless an exception can be relied upon to collect the information from a third party. Relevant exceptions may include: where the data subject authorises the University to collect personal information from a third partywhere collecting personal information from a third party would not prejudice the data subject\u2019s interestswhere the information is collected from a publicly available source, such as the Internetwhere personal information is obtained or verified through relevant government or education agencies, including the New Zealand National Student Indexwhere the information will be used in a form that does not identify the data subject, orwhere another law requires or permits the University to collect personal information from a third party.\nCollection or assigning of unique identifiers\nUnique identifiers assigned by other agencies (\u201cthird-party unique identifiers\u201d, such as the National Student Number (NSN), the National Health Index (NHI), the IRD number) must be collected and managed in accordance with the following requirements: The University must not use third-party unique identifiers to generally identify data subjects within our systems.The University may use a third-party unique identifier for the purposes of communicating with that third party about the relevant data subject (such as where the IRD number is used to communicate with Inland Revenue about an employee).The University must not require data subjects to provide their third-party unique identifiers, unless we can establish that this one of the purposes for which the identifier was assigned by the third party (such as the NSN , which was assigned for the purpose of enabling education providers to search for and modify information about their students).The University must protect third-party unique identifiers from misuse (such as by masking or truncating them in correspondence).The University will assign its own unique identifiers to students, employees and affiliates, for example, in the form of ID numbers. These unique identifiers are necessary to enable the University to carry out its functions efficiently. However, the University must assign unique identifiers in accordance with the following requirements: The University must take reasonable steps to ensure that unique identifiers are assigned only to an individual whose identity is clearly established, and that the risk of misuse of a unique identifier by any person is minimised.The University must protect its unique identifiers from misuse (such as by masking or truncating them in correspondence).Student and employee ID cards will be allocated in conjunction with appropriate personal information, as governed by the Identity Card Sector Allocation Policy and Identity Card Issuing Policy.\nTransparency\nSubject to clause 1(h), at the time that personal information is being collected from a data subject, the University Community must ensure that data subjects are made aware: what information is being collectedwhy the information is being collectedhow the information will be usedwho the information will be shared withif the collection of the information is authorised or required by or under law, the particular law by or under which the collection of the information is authorised or required and whether the supply of the information by the individual is voluntary or mandatorythe consequences (if any) for that individual if all or any part of the requested information is not provided, andwhat rights they have in relation to their information.If the information collected is a routine part of University process (that is, the collection of information is not unusual or ad hoc), it will be sufficient for compliance with clause 1(f) above if the University Community refers to, or provides the data subject with a link to, the relevant privacy statement.Unless the data collection relates to data subjects located in the EU or China, it is not necessary to comply with 1(f) if an individual with appropriate authority believes on reasonable grounds that: Non-compliance would not prejudice the interests of the individual;Non-compliance is necessary to avoid prejudice to the investigation, prevention, or prosecution of offences, or for the purposes of court proceedings;Compliance would prejudice the purposes of the collection; orThat compliance is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances of the particular case; orThat the information will not be used in a form in which the individual concerned is identified or will be used for statistical or research purposes and will not be published in a form that could reasonably be expected to identify the individual concerned. If you are uncertain of your obligations you must consult with your Manager, who may consult with a University Privacy Officer.Occasional or ad hoc collections, such as individual research projects, may require the provision of specific privacy notices relating to that collection.Where a new collection, use or disclosure of personal information is to become a routine part of University process, the responsible member of the University Community must ensure that the Privacy Officer is notified and the relevant privacy statement is updated to reflect this.\nMethod of collection\nPersonal information must only be collected in ways that are lawful and, in the circumstances, not unfair or unreasonably intrusive. This maintains personal dignity and protects data subjects from disproportionate or overly intrusive practices. Unlawful collection methods are those that are prohibited by law.Unfair collection methods could include not telling data subjects that information is being collected or deceiving data subjects about the purpose for collecting information. There are some instances where such collection methods may be appropriate (e.g., when conducting research), where there are other protections or processes establishing appropriate ethical protections.Unreasonably intrusive collection methods could include collecting sensitive personal information in a public space or using CCTV cameras in sensitive locations such as bathrooms.The University Community must be especially careful when collecting personal information from children or young people (such as some students and prospective students) to ensure that the collection is fair. This might include providing a simple summary of our privacy statement or ensuring that a child\u2019s caregiver is aware that we are collecting personal information about their child. Where a student is 18 years or older it is expected that the University will liaise with them directly in respect of collecting their personal information.\nCollection of sensitive personal information\nSome jurisdictions the University might operate in \u2013 including the EU, China and Australia \u2013 specifically regulate the collection of sensitive personal information. Where the University is directly and knowingly collecting information for people located in these jurisdictions, we must obtain consent to collect sensitive personal information, unless that information is being collected for the purposes of public health management (such as pandemic management), the delivery of health services to the individual, for occupational or employment purposes or in order to respond to an emergency (e.g., concerning a threat to the life or safety of an individual or individuals).\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Security and retention of personal information (including access)\nSecurity\nAll members of the University Community have a responsibility to protect the personal information they handle against loss, misuse, or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.Before sharing personal information with a contracted service provider, the University Community must ensure that the service provider is required and able to provide an adequate level of protection to the personal information shared. This will usually be achieved by entering into a binding contract with the third party that includes a minimum set of privacy obligations on the third party.\nAccess\nMembers of the University Community must only access personal information that is required by them to carry out a function of their University employment or research or study. Any subsequent use of the information must also be clearly based on professional need.Access to personal information, which is to be granted in accordance with the established approval processes for each system and/or data set, should only be granted to a member of the University Community if there is a legitimate need.It is the responsibility of the Head of Department (or their delegate) to ensure access to personal information is removed when no longer required by a role or individual.Access to personal information about students must be managed in accordance with the Authorisation of Access to Student Information Procedure.\nRetention\nMembers of the University Community must not retain personal information for longer than the University has a lawful purpose to use it, and must delete information in compliance with the Information and Records Management Policy.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use and disclosure of personal information\nAnticipated uses and disclosures\nExcept as provided in clause 3(b) below, personal information must only be used or disclosed by the University Community if that use or disclosure is the purpose for which the information was collected, and has been made clear to the data subject in the relevant privacy statement (if applicable).\nNew uses and disclosures\nBefore using or disclosing personal information in new ways, or in ways that are not part of the University\u2019s routine business, the University Community must ensure that this is necessary for a lawful purpose or is otherwise permitted or required by law, including where any one of the following Privacy Act exceptions applies: the relevant data subject has authorised the University to use or disclose their information in this waythe use or disclosure is directly related to the purposes for which the information was collectedthe information will be de-identified (anonymised)the information was collected from a public source (such as information collected from public social media accounts), and it would not be unfair or unreasonable in the circumstances to use or disclose it in this waythe use or disclosure is necessary to assist with the investigation, prevention, or prosecution of offences (such as using gathering evidence of staff fraud), or for the purposes of court proceedingsthe use or disclosure is necessary to prevent a serious threat to life or health (such as tracking staff location for pandemic management), orthe use or disclosure is required or permitted by another law (such as the Education and Training Act 2020 or the Education (Pastoral Care of Tertiary and International Learners) Code of Practice 2021).Where authorisation (or consent) is the lawful basis relied upon to process personal information, the University Community must ensure that this consent is: express \u2013 which means a clear, affirmative action, not a pre-selected boxfreely given \u2013 which means there are no conditions attached to the consent (such as the inability to provide a service), or there are no power imbalances at play (such as in the employment relationship)current and specific \u2013 which means perpetual or very general consents should be avoidedinformed \u2013 which means ensuring the data subject is made fully aware what personal information and processing the consent relates to, andclear \u2013 which means simple and in plain language.Third party requests for personal information that are not part of routine University business \u2013 including requests from other universities, family of students, government departments, or law enforcement agencies \u2013 must be escalated to a Privacy Officer.Personal information must not be disclosed to third parties based overseas without the approval of the Privacy Officer, who must consider whether the overseas third party is subject to privacy requirements that are equivalent to those contained in the Privacy Act. This will usually be achieved by entering into a binding contract with the third party that includes a minimum set of privacy obligations on the third party.\u00a0\u00a0Where that is not practicable, the University may obtain the informed consent of the data subject for the disclosure (such as when disclosing personal information to overseas thesis supervisors).\nUsing AI tools to make automated decisions\nThe University might develop, procure, or use AI tools to assist us to make inferences or automated decisions about individuals. These tools might be used to manage course administration processes, deliver services (such as remote examination proctoring), or for the purposes of data analytics.The use of AI tools can raise significant privacy risks, and is subject to specific regulation in some jurisdictions (such as the EU). The use of AI tools should be managed on the basis of the following risk threshold: Unacceptable risk \u2013 Tools intended to infer the emotions of individuals in the education or employment context, or intended to infer sensitive attributes about individuals (such as race or sexual orientation).High risk \u2013 Tools intended to automate the processing of personal information in order to determine access or admission to study programmes, to evaluate learning outcomes, to steer a student\u2019s learning process, or to monitor student behaviour during examinations, or to otherwise automate decisions that could have a significant impact on the rights or interests of data subjects.Low risk \u2013 Tools that do not make decisions about individuals or automate important processes.The University Community must not use AI tools for any purposes that fall into the unacceptable risk category. The one exception is academic research, provided it satisfies ethical requirements, is compliant with the Health Information Privacy Code and any applicable law, and is compliant with the privacy expectations of the source of the information.If a member of the University Community intends to develop, procure, or use AI tools for any purposes that fall into the high risk category, they must complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA \u2013 see clause 5 below) and obtain the approval of the Privacy Officer.When using an AI tool which collects, processes or handles personal information, the University Community must: Where possible, use best efforts to ensure the data used to train, run or prompt the tool is fit for purpose, including that it is accurate, up to date, complete, relevant, and that it does not raise issues of bias.Be transparent with data subjects about the use of the tool. This might include updating our privacy statements to provide notice about such use.Ensure that the University has a lawful basis to process the personal information within the tool, such as where the processing is directly related to the purposes for which the information was collected.Review outputs or outcomes from the tool to ensure that they meet expectations, are lawful and ethical, and do not adversely impact on individuals or communities in unexpected or unintended ways.If using an AI tool to automate significant decisions about data subjects, ensure that the affected data subjects can challenge those decisions with a human, and can object to the use of such tools to make decisions about them (see clause 4(c)(v) below).If developing a low risk AI tool such as a chatbot, ensure that individuals are made aware that they are interacting with an AI system not a human.The University Community must also be mindful that poor model performance, inadequate monitoring, bias and discrimination, copyright infringement, lack of explainability, and inadequate governance create particular risks when using AI to collect, process or handle personal information.\nSpecific considerations in relation to using generative AI tools to process personal information\nThe University Community must use generative AI tools in accordance with the Use of Generative-Artificial Intelligences and Autonomous Content Generation in Learning and Teaching Policy, which includes a requirement to ensure privacy issues are appropriately managed.The University Community must be mindful of the privacy risks created by using both public and enterprise generative AI tools to process personal information (either in training or in inference) including: Accuracy \u2013 The personal information intended to be processed within the tool must be fit for purpose. This requires checking (where possible) that the information is accurate, up to date, complete and relevant, and that it does not raise issues of bias.Use and disclosure \u2013 The University must have a lawful basis to use or disclose personal information within the tool. Processing personal information via public tools increases the risk of subsequent uses or disclosures that are unlawful.Security and retention \u2013 It is difficult to determine how secure public tools are. Once information is ingested into the tool, it may not be possible to delete it.Access and correction \u2013 Data subjects can ask to access or correct their personal information that is being processed within a tool, which could be extremely difficult to manage in practice. If these risks cannot be managed or mitigated then AI may not be the right tool in the circumstances.The University Community must not use public generative AI tools to process personal or confidential information.If a member of the University Community intends to use an enterprise generative AI tool to process personal information, they must complete a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA \u2013 see clause 5 below) and obtain the approval of the Privacy Officer.\nAccuracy\nMembers of the University Community must take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is accurate and up to date before using or disclosing it, particularly where this use or disclosure could impact on the rights or interests of the data subject.\nProcessing sensitive personal information\nSome jurisdictions the University might operate in \u2013 including the EU, China and Australia \u2013 specifically regulate the processing of sensitive personal information. Where the University is delivering services to students or other people located in these jurisdictions, we must obtain consent to process sensitive personal information, unless that information is being processed for the purposes of public health management (such as pandemic management), the delivery of health services to the individual, or for occupational or employment purposes or in order to respond to an emergency (e.g., concerning a threat to the life or safety of an individual or individuals).\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Data subject rights\nPrivacy laws give the University\u2019s data subjects important privacy rights, which support transparency and accountability, protect individual autonomy and give data subjects some control over the way we collect, retain, use and share their information. The specific rights a data subject has will depend on their geographic location and applicable privacy laws in that jurisdiction.Data subject rights requests must be managed in accordance with the procedural requirements set out in privacy laws, including: The University must respond to a request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any case not later than 20 working days after the day on which the request is received. The response must include the following information: That the University does not hold the personal information in a way that enables the information to be readily retrieved; orThat the University does not hold any personal information about the individual to whom the request relates; orThat the University does hold personal information about the individual to whom the request relates and, if access to the information has been requested, that \u2013 Access to that information, or some of that information, is granted; orAccess to that information, or some of that information, is refused and the grounds for refusal; orThe University neither confirms nor denies that it holds any personal information about the individual to whom the request relates.The University does not necessarily have to provide the personal information at the same time as they provide the individual with their decision. However, if the University has agreed to provide personal information it will need to do so without undue delay.It is important that members of the University Community who receive data subject rights requests can recognise those requests and escalate them quickly to the relevant Privacy Officer.Information should be released in the form preferred by the requester, unless doing so would impair the University\u2019s efficient administration.The University Community must take reasonable steps to ensure that we are releasing personal information to the data subject only, unless they authorise us to release it to someone else.The University Community may charge a reasonable fee to process a request, but should not generally do so, and any fee must be approved by a Privacy Officer.Depending on their location, the University\u2019s data subjects may have the right to: Access \u2013 Ask the University to confirm whether or not we are processing their personal information and, if we are, ask us for a copy of their information.Correction \u2013 Ask the University to correct personal information about them that they think is wrong. If we do not agree the data subject can ask us to attach a statement of correction to the information.Erasure (if the data subject is based in the EU or China) \u2013 Ask the University to erase their personal information if: it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collectedthey have withdrawn their consent for the processing of the information (where the processing was based on consent)we have accepted their objection to processing, and we have no other lawful basis to retain itit has been processed unlawfully, orthis is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, andwe are not required to retain it under the Public Records Act or the University General Disposal Authority.Restrict processing (if the data subject is based in the EU or China) \u2013 Ask the University to restrict the processing of their personal information if: the accuracy of the personal information is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracythe processing is unlawful, but they do not want it to be erasedit is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but it is still needed to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, orthey have objected to processing, and we are still considering that objection.Object to processing \u2013 Object to the processing of their personal information, where the University is processing personal information based on its legitimate interests, including where this involves automated decision-making.Withdraw consent \u2013 Withdraw their consent, if they have given the University consent for the processing of their personal information. Note that this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing of personal information that has been carried out based on the consent before its withdrawal.All data subject rights requests must be escalated to the relevant Privacy Officer.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)\nWhere applicable, the University endeavours to take a \u201cPrivacy by Design\u201d approach to the development of new or changed processes or systems. This means that we adhere to the following principles: Proactive not reactive; Preventative not remedialPrivacy as the defaultPrivacy embedded into designFull functionality \u2013 Positive-sum, not zero-sumEnd-to-end security \u2013 Lifecycle protectionVisibility and transparency, andRespect for user privacyAny member of the University Community responsible for creating or changing a process or system, that involves a new collection, use or disclosure of personal information or that may impact the security or integrity of personal information already held by the University, must complete a PIA and consult on this PIA with a Privacy Officer. You can access a copy of the PIA template:Privacy Impact Assessment template (DOCX)At a minimum, a PIA must be completed in any of the following situations, which may be likely to create high privacy risk: processing sensitive personal informationdeveloping, procuring, or using AI tools for any purposes that fall into the high risk category as set out at section 3(g)(ii) aboveusing generative AI tools to process personal informationprocuring a new third party service provider to store or process personal information on the University\u2019s behalf, ordisclosing personal information to a new third party, including an overseas third party.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Privacy breach management\nAll members of the University Community must ensure that any privacy breach they become aware of is reported promptly to a Privacy Officer in compliance with the applicable Privacy Breach Management Procedure.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Roles and responsibilities\nThe Audit and Risk Committee, which is a University Council committee, is responsible for: providing oversight and monitoring, including through receipt of regular management reports, of University of Otago's privacy status and obtaining assurance from internal and external information systems auditors.The Vice-Chancellor is responsible for: advocating cultural values that promote good privacy practice, andsupporting the Privacy Officer and others to ensure personal information is managed in accordance with this policyThe Privacy Officer is responsible for: supporting the University Community to understand and comply with this policy, including by maintaining and developing relevant procedures, standards and guidelinesdeveloping and offering privacy training as requiredassisting with the management of privacy breaches, data subject rights requests, and other privacy issuesmanaging privacy complaints from data subjectsreporting on privacy breaches and general privacy compliance to the Audit and Risk Committee and, where required, the Vice-Chancellor, andliaising with third parties in respect of privacy matters, including the Privacy Commissioner or other relevant regulators and data subjects.All managers are responsible for: supporting staff to understand and comply with this policy and participate in any privacy training provided by the University, andensuring privacy breaches, data subject rights requests, and other privacy issues are identified and managed in accordance with this policy.All members of the University Community are responsible for: knowing and understanding their privacy responsibilitiescomplying with this policy and any associated proceduresactively participating in any privacy training provided by the University, andreporting any privacy breaches, data subject rights requests, or other privacy issues to the Privacy Officer"}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Procurement_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Procurement_Policy.html", "scope": "This policy applies to all University employees, contractors or consultants acting on behalf of the University in procuring goods or services (including consultant services) by any contractual means.", "purpose": "The aim of this policy is: \nto ensure that the University obtains, where possible, the best value for its expenditure; andto ensure that the University obtains, where possible, purchases made in an sustainable manner; andto ensure purchases are made in an open, fair and transparent manner.", "content": "1.Policy\nThe University will specify and secure required goods and services of appropriate quality, on economically-favourable terms, in a timely and efficient manner adhering to the principles laid out in clause 2 of this policy.All purchases must adhere to the University's financial delegation policy and be approved prior to the goods/service being ordered.\n2.Procurement Principles\nAccountability \u2013 the University is accountable to the New Zealand Public to deliver University priorities and objectives in a manner that is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable.Sustainability \u2013 The University will ensure the selection of products and services that provide value for money on a whole life cycle basis and achieve wider economic, social and environmental benefits.

Policy\nAll employees and members of a governing body of the University must facilitate the disclosure and investigation of matters of serious wrongdoing in or by the University.A Discloser may disclose information under these procedures if the following criteria are met: the information is about serious wrongdoing in or by the University and the Discloser believes on reasonable grounds that it is true or likely to be true;the information is disclosed in accordance with the Act and this Policy (which summarises the Act); andthe disclosure is not made in bad faith.Note: A disclosure that meets the above criteria is called a 'Protected Disclosure' under the Act.Any other person who discloses any information in support of, or relating to, a protected disclosure having already been made, is also entitled to protection under the provisions of this Policy and the Act if that Discloser: discloses in accordance with this Policy; anddoes not disclose the information in bad faith.A Discloser is entitled to the protections provided in this Policy and the Act, even if: they are mistaken and there is no serious wrongdoing; orthey do not refer to this Policy or the name of the Act when making the disclosure.Any person who wishes to make a protected disclosure may choose to report the matter anonymously through the independent Whistleblower hotline (0800 100 526).All evidence gathered in relation to a protected disclosure must be fully preserved and protected.The University will not retaliate against any employee for intending to make, or for having to make a protected disclosure.The University will not treat, or threaten to treat a person less favourably than others in similar circumstances for intending to make or having made a protected disclosure, encouraging another person to make a protected disclosure, or for giving information in support of a protected disclosure.Neither a Discloser who makes a protected disclosure, nor a receiver who refers the disclosure, under the Act is liable to any civil, criminal or disciplinary proceeding because of making or referring the disclosure.\n3. Procedure\nMaking a disclosure Where a person to which this Policy relates becomes aware of information about serious wrongdoing, but does not report the matter anonymously through the Whistleblower hotline, they must disclose it without delay to any of the following persons at the University: their managertheir manager\u2019s manager;any senior manager;the Director, Human Resources;the Risk Office;the Registrar; andThe Vice-ChancellorNote: Disclosure will normally be made on a \u2018one-up\u2019 basis i.e. to the immediate line manager of the person making the disclosure, or in appropriate circumstances, to their manager\u2019s line manager.A Discloser or potential Discloser may also approach any of the above-named persons, as well as the Whistleblower hotline, and an Appropriate Authority (including the Ombudsman) for advice, support and practical assistance, as well as to assist in assessing any risks to a Discloser in making a protected disclosure.\u00a0A Discloser may instead make a protected disclosure directly to the Vice-Chancellor if they believe on reasonable grounds that a member of the Senior Leadership Team or a member of the University Council may be involved in the serious wrongdoing or has a relationship or association with an alleged wrongdoer.A Discloser who becomes aware of information about serious wrongdoing may also choose to report it to an Appropriate Authority at any time, including (without limitation) circumstances where: the Discloser is of the view that reporting to an Appropriate Authority is justified due to the urgency of the matter or other exceptional circumstances, orthe Vice-Chancellor may be involved in the alleged serious wrongdoing, orthere has been no action or recommended action on the matter to which the disclosure relates within 20 working days after the date on which the disclosure was made.Please refer to the flowchart set out in Appendix 1 for further information on making a disclosure under the Act and this Policy.Receiving a disclosure If a person receives, or is approached for advice or support about, a protected disclosure and: they are aware that they may have some involvement in the alleged serious wrongdoing, orthey have any relationship or association with an alleged wrongdoer, they must immediately advise the person to contact either the Whistleblower hotline (0800 100 526) or another person listed in clause 3(a)1. above.All protected disclosures which are not made through the Whistleblower hotline must be referred on to the Director, Human Resources immediately by the manager receiving the disclosure.\u00a0The Director, Human Resources may also refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor, in circumstances where the Director, Human Resources considers this is appropriate and following consultation with the applicable Discloser.If the receiver of a protected disclosure considers it appropriate, the receiver can also refer the disclosure to an Appropriate Authority.The applicable manager who has received the disclosure will consult with the Discloser and the intended recipient of a referral, prior to referring the protected disclosure to the intended recipient.\u00a0An intended recipient may include but is not limited to the Director, Human Resources, any other person or an Appropriate Authority.A disclosure may also be referred to an appropriate person within the University as well as to an Appropriate Authority on more than one occasion, provided that the aforementioned requirements are complied with.Confidentiality Any recipient of a protected disclosure, or any person approached for assistance, advice or support in making a protected disclosure, must use their best endeavours not to disclose information that might identify the Discloser who made the protected disclosure unless they have written consent from the Discloser to do so.However, the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor or any investigator appointed by the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor may disclose information that might identify the person who made the protected disclosure if they reasonably believe this is essential: for the effective investigation of the allegations in the protected disclosure, orto prevent serious risk to public health, public safety, the health or safety of any individual, or the environment, orto comply with the principles of natural justice, orif the University is subject to an investigation by a law enforcement or regulatory agency for the purpose of law enforcement.Where such information is to be disclosed for the effective investigation of the allegations in the protected disclosure, or to comply with the principles of natural justice, the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor must consult the Discloser about the intended release.However, where the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor considers it is impracticable in the circumstances to consult with a Discloser due to a serious risk to public health, public safety,\u00a0the health and safety of any individual, or the environment; or to an impending investigation by a law enforcement or regulatory agency for the purposes of law enforcement as outlined in clause 3(c)ii), the requirement to consult prior to the disclosure does not apply.After releasing any identifying information for a reason described in the circumstances above, the receiver must inform the Discloser that their information has been referred and disclosed to another person.Anyone may seek information and guidance from an Ombudsman about this duty of confidentiality.Action following a disclosure After the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor receives a protected disclosure under these procedures, they must give it full consideration and decide with an open mind whether or not the alleged serious wrongdoing should be investigated or whether any further action should be taken.\u00a0The potential outcomes may be: investigating the disclosure;addressing any serious wrongdoing by acting or recommending action;referring the disclosure to an Appropriate Authority;deciding that no action is required.Note: The process of any investigation, and a decision to investigate, will depend on the nature of the alleged wrongdoing.A decision not to investigate alleged serious wrongdoing must be recorded in writing and does not prevent the University from taking further action in relation to matters raised in the protected disclosure, as appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0However, the original Discloser will be consulted on any further action that may be taken, should it require further disclosure to any other person.The Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor may direct another person to make preliminary inquiries or gather evidence on their behalf or perform any other work as necessary to assist them in making their decision.\u00a0\u00a0If the receiver intends to do so, the Discloser will be consulted and notified of any further disclosure.The Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor must also notify the Discloser within 20 working days from the date of the disclosure of their decision whether or not the alleged serious wrongdoing is to be investigated providing reasons for this decision.Where suspected fraudulent activity is identified by the Director, Human Resources /Vice-Chancellor this must be reported immediately to the University\u2019s Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance.\u00a0The Discloser will be notified that their protected disclosure will be referred to the University\u2019s Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance prior to this occurring.If the protected disclosure is investigated, a final report detailing the outcome of the investigation and steps taken must be provided to the Director, Human Resources and the Vice-Chancellor, and held as a record by the University's Office of Risk Assurance and Compliance.Note: Further disciplinary or legal action may be taken, as appropriate, in line with the final repor.Further disclosure A Discloser may choose to disclose information about serious wrongdoing to an Appropriate Authority or an Ombudsman if they are dissatisfied with the outcome of any investigation by the University into the serious wrongdoing or any actions taken in respect of such serious wrongdoing.\n Related policies, procedures and

Procedure for negotiations of employment agreements\nThe University of Otago aims to treat all staff fairly and consistently.\u00a0\u00a0For the sake of consistency and efficiency, it endeavours to have as few variations of employment conditions as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of whether the individual or collective agreements are negotiated first, the University will aim to offer staff on similar employment agreements a variation to their agreement to closely reflect the changes to the other agreement, both in terms of remuneration and any other changes to terms and conditions.\u00a0\u00a0In recent years, the collective agreements have been settled first and have been followed by the individual offers.\nThe following section outlines how these changes are to be implemented unless otherwise agreed in the terms of settlement.\na. Collective employment agreements\nCollective employment agreements are agreements that cover two or more employees who are union members.\nFor staff on collective employment agreements, bargaining will be conducted by their unions on their behalf.\u00a0\u00a0Once agreement has been reached between the negotiating parties, the unions will undertake a ratification process to formalise the terms of settlement (i.e. what was agreed upon).\nThe resulting changes will be implemented as soon as practicable.\u00a0\u00a0The unions will be advised of the process for implementation including the pay date that any increases will be paid and when the new written Collective Employment Agreement is available. Depending on the timing and numbers of staff involved, there is likely to be a delay between the ratification and the implementation of any increase. Staff covered by a collective agreement (i.e. they would be a union member) and whose agreement with the University has ended would only receive any related backdated pay increase if they were employed at the time the University has been advised by the union that the terms of settlement has been ratified.\nThe following collective agreements are currently in place at the University of Otago:\nGeneral Staff Collective Employment AgreementAcademic Staff (non Medical/Dental) Collective Employment AgreementSchool/ECE Support Service Staff (College of Education) Collective Agreement\nb. Individual employment agreements\nIndividual employment agreements are agreements that cover one employee whose position is not covered by a collective agreement and/or chooses not to be a union member. The University operates a number of standard individual employment agreements.\nThe individual negotiations may take place either prior to or after the collective negotiations. The negotiations will normally be initiated by a letter of offer to the staff member. Staff will be given the opportunity to respond to the offer. Staff whose agreement with the University has ended (including through retirement, redundancies and settlements) would only receive any related backdated increase if they receive a letter offering the change in conditions.\ni. General staff\nThe following employment agreements are linked to the General Staff Collective Employment Agreement as they have the same pay scale/scales and similar terms and conditions.\nGeneral Staff Individual Employment AgreementPoisons Officer Individual Employment Agreement\nThe following employment agreements also apply to general staff and will normally be offered the same increase and changes to terms and conditions.\nExecutive Residence Housekeepers Individual Employment AgreementUniversity Union Individual Employment Agreements (salaried staff and permanent staff)General Practitioners Individual Employment Agreement\nThe following employment agreements also apply to general staff but are negotiated for the academic year. Any changes to terms and conditions for staff employed on these agreements will become effective from 1 January.\nCasual Individual Employment AgreementStudent Individual Employment AgreementTutor Demonstrator Individual Employment AgreementExamination Supervisor Individual Employment Agreement\nii.

Any changes to terms and conditions for staff employed on these agreements will become effective from 1 January.\nCasual Individual Employment AgreementClinical Tutor (school contract)\nThe following employment agreement is also normally negotiated for one year. Any changes to terms and conditions for staff employed on these agreements will become effective from 1 February.\nDental Health House Surgeon Individual Employment AgreementClinical Lecturers\niii. Management band staff\nThe Vice-Chancellor will make a decision on whether or not it is appropriate to offer an increase to staff employed on Management Band Individual Employment Agreements.\n\n5. Placement of staff members on a pay scale and progression within a pay scale\na. Placement\ni. Academic staff\nDecisions on how to place new academic staff on the salary scale are made with reference to the definitions in the academic promotions policy. For staff in positions covered by the academic promotions policy, the appointment process can not be used to circumvent the requirements for academic promotion. Appointments to Associate Professor must be approved by the Staffing Advisory Committee. Appointments to Professor must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor.\u00a0\u00a0For academic staff being appointed to positions which are not covered by the academic promotions policy please refer to the relevant employment agreement for information about how decisions are made with regard to placement on the pay scale, or seek advice from Human Resources.\nii. General staff\nSection 6 explains the procedures for general staff who are paid on Scale 1 (the eight level salary structure which applies to most general staff).\u00a0\u00a0For other general staff, please refer to the relevant employment agreement for information about how decisions are made with regard to placement on the pay scale, or seek advice from Human Resources.\nb. Progression\nPlacement on a salary scale may be reviewed if this is provided by the employment agreement.\u00a0\u00a0Staff should refer to their employment agreement for information about salary progression.\ni. Academic staff\nThe salaries of academic staff are reviewed as defined in the employment agreement.\u00a0\u00a0Additional information is available on the Academic Progressions pages on the Human Resources website.\nii. General staff\nThe salaries of general staff on Scale 1 are reviewed on an annual basis as part of the Performance Development Review (PDR) process.\u00a0\u00a0For other general staff, please refer to the relevant employment agreement for information about how decisions are made with regard to placement on the pay scale, or seek advice from Human Resources.\niii. Fixed Term Agreements\nStaff on fixed term agreements will be considered for progression and promotion using the same processes as for permanent staff.\u00a0\u00a0If a new fixed term agreement is offered to the staff member, and a progression or promotion is approved, it will be effective from the date specified in the relevant progression or promotion process.\u00a0\u00a0Any consideration for promotion or progression, which would take effect after the end of the term of the agreement, shall not bind the University to provide employment beyond the term of the agreement.\niv. Secondments\nStaff on secondment will be considered for progression in both their seconded position and their permanent position, dependent on the timing of the secondment and the timing of the relevant progression process. For general staff please refer to the PDR guidelines. The manager for the secondment and the manager for the permanent position should agree how this will be managed at the time the secondment is arranged.\n\n6. Placement of general staff members on Scale 1 pay scale\nThe University operates an eight-level salary structure (Scale 1) applicable to most general staff, with Level 1 being the lowest and Level 8 being the highest.\u00a0\u00a0The decision on which level a position covered by this scale is placed on is made through the Job Evaluation system (see the Job Evaluation section 8).\nEach level is divided into two halves. The lower half is the appointment salary range and the upper half is the merit salary range. Each level has a series of defined salary steps. Staff can only be placed on the designated steps identified in the pay scale.\nPlacement on a particular step within the level will be based on the PDR criteria.\na. Procedure for appointment of external applicants within Scale 1\nA new appointee will be placed at one of the \u201cappointment steps\u201d within the appropriate level for the position. The appointment steps are marked in bold on the pay scale. Appointing to any other step in the appointment range is not permitted.\nPlacement of a new appointee on a particular step within the level will be based on the criteria used in the PDR. The manager will use information gained through the recruitment process to assess their experience, qualifications and levels of previous performance against the outcomes and competencies needed for the job.\nA factor managers should consider is how long they reasonably expect it to take for the appointee to achieve full competency within the University of Otago environment. Some indications may be provided by the experience and knowledge of the person(s) who are training, inducting and mentoring this person in their new role.\nSalary relativities should also be considered, i.e. what are the salaries of staff performing similar roles and their supervisors?\ni. Appointment range\nDivisional Heads, or those who have delegated authority from their Divisional Head, have the authority to appoint within the appointment salary range of the level based on their assessment of the new appointee during the recruitment process.\nA new appointee being offered a salary at the top of the appointment range will have demonstrated during the recruitment process that they were performing at a fully competent level in a similar position as defined by the PDR guidelines.\nii. Merit range\nIf a Divisional Head (Dean in Health Sciences) believes that a new appointee has demonstrated during the recruitment process that they are already capable of performing at an outstanding level as defined by the PDR guidelines, they may apply to the Director of Human Resources to appoint in the merit range.\u00a0\u00a0Agreement on the appropriate salary for merit appointments should be reached between the Divisional Head (Dean in Health Sciences) and the Director of Human Resources based on the assessment of the new appointee. The final decision rests with the Director of Human Resources.\nOther considerations for setting the level of appointment will include salary relativities and comparisons of performance outcomes within the Department, School, Division and University.\niii. New appointees without the minimum qualifications and/or experience\nIn rare circumstances where there are difficulties recruiting a suitable person, consideration may be given to appointing a candidate with potential but without the minimum qualifications and/or experience for the position.\u00a0\u00a0 In these circumstances, they may be appointed at a salary appropriate to their qualifications and experience with a specific development plan which must be put in place at the time of the appointment.\u00a0\u00a0This development plan will specify the performance criteria that the new appointee must meet in order to demonstrate the minimum qualifications and experience. This development plan will also detail the process and timing of assessment against those criteria.\u00a0\u00a0Once assessed as meeting the minimum qualifications and experience they will advance to the appropriate level for the position. A specific scale for salary progression for technical trainees is available.\nb. Salary considerations for current staff members being appointed to a new position on Scale 1\nAppointment to a new position would normally occur as a result of being appointed to an advertised University vacancy.\u00a0\u00a0Consideration should be given to placing the salary at one of the \u201cappointment steps\u201d within the appropriate level for the position.\u00a0\u00a0The appointment steps are marked in bold on the pay scale.\u00a0\u00a0 Please note that if the appointment is as a result of redeployment, the provisions of the Management of Change policy will apply.\ni. Appointment to a new position at the SAME level:\nAppointment range: Where the internal applicant's current salary falls within the appointment salary range of the new position, the applicant may be offered an increase in salary to an appropriate appointment step up to the top of the appointment range of the salary range of the new position subject to the following:\nThe appointee is to be assessed against the PDR criteria (objectives and competencies) for the new position. Placement within the appointment Range will be based on this criteria.Salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.Where the applicant's current position and the new position are similar, the applicant may be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above).\u00a0\u00a0Please note that if the appointment commences after 1 August, the staff member will not be eligible for a salary increase through the PDR the following 1 February.\nMerit range: As with external applicants, appointment in the merit range may only occur by application to the Director of Human Resources (refer above), with the following two exceptions:\nWhere an internal applicant's current salary falls within the merit salary range of the new position, the applicant may be appointed at the same step as their current salary provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities within the Department, school and/or Division.\nIf all the following conditions apply, the applicant may be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above).\nthe appointment is made between 1 August and 31 January; andthe applicant's current position and the new position are similar; andthe salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities with the Department, School and/or Division; andthe applicant would have received an increase through the PDR.\nii. Appointment to a new position at a HIGHER level\nAppointment range: Where the internal applicant's current salary falls below the salary range of the new position or within the appointment salary range of the new position, the applicant may be offered an increase in salary to an appropriate appointment step up to the top of the appointment range of the salary range of the new position subject to the following:\nThe appointee is to be assessed against the PDR criteria (objectives and competencies) for the new position. Placement within the appointment range will be based on this criteria.Salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.Where the applicant's current position and the new position are similar, the applicant will normally be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above).\u00a0\u00a0Please note that if the appointment commences after 1 August, the staff member will not be eligible for a salary increase through the PDR the following 1 February.\nMerit range: As with external applicants, appointment in the merit range may only occur by application to the Director of Human Resources (refer above), with the following two exceptions:\nWhere an internal applicant's current salary falls within the merit salary range of the new position, the applicant may be appointed at the same step as their current salary provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\nIf all the following conditions apply,\u00a0\u00a0the applicant may be appointed with an increase in salary which is consistent with the standard increase applied through the PDR (3 steps for staff in levels 1 to 3 and 4 steps for staff in levels 4 and above)\nthe appointment is made between 1 August and 31 January; andthe applicant would have received an increase through the Performance and Development Review; andthe applicant's current position and the new position are similar; andthe salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position, and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\niii. Appointment to a new position at a LOWER level:\nWhere the internal applicant's current salary falls within the full salary range (appointment and merit ranges) of the new position, the applicant may be appointed at the nearest step above their current salary provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\nWhere the internal applicant's current salary falls above the salary range of the new position, the applicant shall transfer with a reduction in salary to an appropriate point within the salary range of the new position that is consistent with the assessment of the applicant against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division. Please contact Human Resources for assistance.\niv. Salary reductions\nIf the applicant's current salary is not consistent with the assessment against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the new position or with salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division, the salary may be reduced.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact Human Resources for assistance.\nv.Recruitment and Retention Supplements\nIf a staff member receives a recruitment and retention supplement, the supplement will be reviewed at the time of appointment to a new position.\u00a0\u00a0Normally the supplement will be incorporated into the staff member's new salary.\n\n7. Job Evaluation\nThe decision on which level a position covered by Scale 1 is placed is made through the Job Evaluation system.\u00a0\u00a0The Job Evaluation Committee will evaluate the job description, place the position into the appropriate salary level and determine the effective date of any change.\u00a0\u00a0The effective date of any salary adjustments resulting from Job Evaluation will normally be the date of receipt of the revised job description by Human Resources.\nFor recruitment purposes, the manager will decide whether a position should be submitted for Job Evaluation. Where substantial changes to a job description occur (i.e. one or more of the criteria used in Job Evaluation are significantly affected), the manager should apply to the Job Evaluation Committee for the position to be re-evaluated.\nAn application for Job Evaluation should include the following:\nthe new job description signed by the manager and the staff member(s),the job description as it was last evaluated or the job description of a similar evaluated position,a completed Job Evaluation Application form,an organisation chart.a covering memo detailing the reasons for the re-evaluation (optional but recommended),\nFor advice or assistance with Job Evaluation, please contact:\nHuman Resources Email job.evaluation@otago.ac.nz\na. Salary considerations for current staff members whose position is re-evaluated within Scale 1 to reflect changes in job content\nWhere significant changes to the substance of a job description occur, staff members and their managers may make application for the position to be re-evaluated (see above).\u00a0\u00a0The result of the re-evaluation may be that the position is placed in a higher level, the same level or a lower level.\u00a0\u00a0In transferring to a new salary level through Job Evaluation, the individual's current salary will not be reduced.\ni. Re-evaluation of a current position to a HIGHER level:\nWhere the position is placed in a higher level and the staff member's current salary falls below the salary range of that level or within the appointment salary range of that level, the staff member's salary will be increased to the nearest appointment step in the new level from the date that the re-evaluation takes effect.\nThe manager may, with approval from the Divisional Head (Dean in Health Sciences), offer an increase in salary to an appropriate appointment step up to the midpoint of the salary range of the revised position, provided that the salary step offered is consistent with the assessment of the staff member against the criteria for the PDR relevant to the revised job description and salary relativities within the Department, School and/or Division.\nWhere the staff member's current salary falls within the merit salary range of the revised position, the staff member's salary will be increased to the nearest salary step in the new level.\nIf a staff member receives a recruitment and retention supplement, the supplement will be reviewed at the time of the re-evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Normally the supplement will be incorporated into the staff member's salary.\nii. Re-evaluation of a current position to the same level:\nWhere the position is placed in the same level and the staff member's current salary does not change.\niii. Re-evaluation of a current position to a LOWER level:\nWhere the staff member's current salary falls within the full salary range (appointment and merit ranges) of the revised position, the staff member's salary will be increased to the nearest step in the new level.\nWhere the staff member's current salary falls above the salary range of the revised position, the staff member will be placed on the highest step in the new level and will be paid a supplement to maintain their salary at their previous salary.\u00a0\u00a0This supplement will abate with general wage increases.\nb. Performance Development Review and Job Evaluation\nIf a staff member's position has changed and the subsequent Job Evaluation affects a staff member's salary level during the timeframe of the PDR process, the Head must decide whether salary progression is appropriate in the new level.\u00a0\u00a0As a general rule, if the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred before 1 August, and the staff's performance is reviewed against the changed position description, the PDR and revised objectives, then salary progression should be considered in the new level.\u00a0\u00a0If the effective date of the re-evaluation of the staff member's position occurred after 1 August, the staff member's performance is reviewed against the old position description and therefore salary progression should be considered in the old level.\u00a0\u00a0For advice please contact:\nEmail hr.pdr@otago.ac.nz\nor\nEmail job.evaluation@otago.ac.nz\n\n8. Use of a Recruitment and Retention Supplement\nRecruitment and retention supplements may be applied to overcome demonstrated difficulties in recruiting and retention.\u00a0\u00a0Recruitment and retention payments will only be made for positions that are of strategic importance or where there are identifiable issues with obtaining staff for the normal University salaries.\nThe salaries offered by the University take into consideration two significant factors. The first is to maintain salary relativities between positions and people within the University.\u00a0\u00a0The second is to ensure, as far as is possible, that salaries offered are competitive with those offered by other employers in similar labour markets.\u00a0\u00a0From time to time the salary level may not be competitive. In such cases a recruitment and retention supplement may be required to attract or retain staff.\nFor recruitment purposes, the recruiting manager may apply for a pre-authorised recruitment and retention supplement.\u00a0\u00a0This must be approved before the possibility of a supplement is mentioned in advertising or in discussions with candidates.\nThe application form for recruitment and retention supplements is available online on the HR Forms page.\u00a0\u00a0Please email rrs.info@otago.ac.nz for salary information from New Zealand salary surveys, if required.\n\n9. Bonus payments\nThe University acknowledges that, from time to time, an additional monetary payment in the form of a bonus may need to be made to a staff member to recognise and reward the achievement of a certain specific task or set of tasks.\nThe University believes that the investment in a bonus payment should occur as soon as possible after the achievement of the particular task or set of tasks for which a bonus payment is to be made.\nThe policy and procedure for the payment of bonuses to general staff is available at the link below:\nBonus Payment Policy and Procedure\nFor academic staff, Pro-Vice-Chancellors may recommend a bonus in recognition of a significant, exceptional event which has not otherwise been recognised. Recommendations should be sent to the Vice-Chancellor and can be made at any stage throughout the year.\nBonus payments up to and including $1,500 per annum \u2013 General staffDivisional HeadBonus payments over $1,500 per annum \u2013 General staffVice-ChancellorBonus payments \u2013 Academic staffVice-Chancellor\n\n10. Salary information for recruitment purposes\nWhere an appointment range applies, the salary range for appointment will be quoted from the first appointment step to the top of the appointment range. The top of the range will also be quoted. For example: \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 Level 4 (Range for Appointments $41,574 to $46,157, Top of Range $50,738)\u201c.\nFor other positions, the full applicable salary range will normally be quoted, for example: \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 Lecturer/Research Fellow ($70,506 to $85,039)\u201c; \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 General Practitioner ($124,950 to $144,188)\u201c.\nFor Management positions the following statement will be used: \u201cSalary Level and Range \u2013 The University is offering a remuneration level commensurate with the responsibilities of the position, qualifications and experiences of the successful appointee.\u201c\nWhere it is not appropriate to advertise the salary range for any reason, including where a position is advertised prior to a confirmed Job Evaluation, no salary information will be provided in the advertisement on the University of Otago website.\nCandidates will be advised to contact either human resources or the department for information. If a Job Evaluation is subsequently confirmed, this may be edited during the advert posting.\nWhere the salary arrangements are complex (for example Joint Clinical Academic vacancies), a statement may be included below the advert text on the University of Otago website.\na.Recruitment and retention supplement information in vacancy information\nThe potential use of a recruitment and retention supplement should be identified prior to advertising. The statement below may be included below the advert text on the University of Otago website if deemed appropriate. This statement should be used EXCEPTIONALLY and only for positions where a recruitment and retention supplement has been pre-authorised (see above). Discussions regarding the use of the statement should be held with Human Resources before a decision on its inclusion is made.\n\u201cThere is a possibility that the University may award a non-superable payment additional to salary to assist recruitment, in respect of this position. Any such payment will be reviewed on an annual basis.\u201d\n\n11. Employee benefits\nThe University of Otago is committed to attracting and retaining the best employees. The University therefore offers a range of benefits and discounts for staff members from superannuation subsidy and retirement planning to health and travel insurance and a number of other services and discounts both within the University and external businesses in Dunedin.\nEmployee benefits of working at the University of Otago\n\nAppendix 1: General staff Scale 1 appointment points\nDownload the General Staff Scale 1 Appointment Points"}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Research_and_Study_Leave_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Research_and_Study_Leave_Policy.html", "scope": " This policy applies to all academic staff.", "purpose": "RSL is undertaken by academic staff members in order to extend their own knowledge and to improve their teaching, research and (if appropriate) clinical skills.", "content": "Research and Leave Study Policy on the Human Resources website"}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Research_Consultation_with_M\u0101ori_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Research_Consultation_with_M\u0101ori_Policy.html", "scope": "The research propositions covered by this policy are those likely to result in project research.", "purpose": "The policy provides the framework for an appropriate and mandated consultation process with M\u0101ori for research.

General principles applying to disclosures of sexual misconduct\nAll members of the University affected by sexual misconduct are entitled to reasonable access to relevant resources, including advocacy and counselling.\u00a0\u00a0Support is also available for students dealing with events which precede enrolment at university, and which impact their ability to work or study.To encourage disclosure, the University of Otago generally will not hold affected parties, disclosing parties or witnesses involved in the addressing of sexual misconduct accountable for breaches of any University policies relating to alcohol or drugs that may have occurred at the time of the alleged sexual misconduct.The University will, to the full extent possible, respect and safeguard the privacy of individuals who disclose allegations of sexual misconduct and all others involved in the process.\u00a0\u00a0Information will be shared only on a need-to-know basis with those who have a role in dealing with the situation under this policy or who have a role in dealing with urgent concerns regarding the safety or welfare of individuals, or as required by natural justice as per clause 5(d) below.Where a complaint is made against a person and investigated by the University, the respondent shall have rights to access all relevant information and to respond prior to a finding being made.\u00a0\u00a0Relevant information may be withheld during the investigative stage of the process, if disclosure may prejudice the investigation, but will be available subsequently.The University, through SMART, will keep a central record of disclosures, in a manner that does not enable individuals to be identified, in order to be able to assess trends and inform best practice and ongoing education.\n6. University response to disclosures of sexual misconduct\nThe University will, in the first instance, respond to all disclosures of sexual misconduct by ensuring the affected party has access to appropriate support (see clause 7).Affected parties may choose to: Make a disclosure without raising a formal complaint: If this only involves seeking support and/or accommodations as per clause 9 below, then the respondent will not be involved or notified, and their identity does not need to be revealed.If this involves seeking protective measures as per clause 9, the respondent will need to be identified and notified of the request, so that protective measures can be discussed.Make a formal complaint: This may also include a request for protective measures or accommodations as per clause 9 below.This requires disclosure of the respondent's identity, who will need to be informed of the identity of the affected party and of the allegations they are making, if the complaint is progressed (see also clause 5(d) above).Formal complaints against students may be dealt with under the following pathways: For grievous sexual misconduct, referral or direct complaint to Police (see also clause 11).For other sexual misconduct, either: University investigation (see clause 10), orcomplaint to Police (see also clause 11).Formal complaints against staff will be managed by Human Resources under the Ethical Behaviour Policy and the staff member's employment agreement or independent contract with the University.\u00a0\u00a0 This may include formal investigation by Human Resources and/or Police involvement as appropriate. An affected party complaining about a staff member may raise the matter directly with the Police if that is their preference.An affected party shall, as far as possible subject to this policy, be entitled to choose the manner in which an allegation is addressed and shall be entitled to change that decision at any time.Where a determination is needed as to whether a formal complaint is considered grievous sexual misconduct (see clause 4(d)iii), or to otherwise assess the level at which a complaint may be considered (see clause 10(b)), the University may seek additional information from the affected party.\u00a0\u00a0In doing so, and so as to minimise trauma and ensure no prejudice in any subsequent investigation: information will be collected in a sensitive manner, which may entail collection through a trusted support person and subsequent relay to the SMART Co\u2011ordinatorinformation collected will be limited to that required to make the relevant determinationa brief record of the basis of the determination will be kept, but no formal statement will be taken, andas far as is practicable, any requirement that the affected party repeat their story will be avoided.Where an affected party who is a student wishes a matter referred to the Police, Te Whare T\u0101wharau and/or the Director of Human Resources (as appropriate) are available if that affected party so wishes to facilitate that referral and to ensure that affected party is provided support.The Proctor may require students who are involved in a Police or University investigation to comply with protective measures as provided for under clause 9 of this policy and/or interim measures under Student Conduct Statute.\u00a0\u00a0The Director of Human Resources may establish and require a member of staff to comply with interim measures consistent with their employment or contractual arrangements with the University.In investigating any allegations, the University will treat all parties and witnesses with dignity and respect.A clear distinction will be maintained between those offering advocacy or ongoing support to those involved in investigations and those responsible for undertaking investigations.\n7. Support following an incident being disclosed\nAs soon as possible after an incident is disclosed, the staff member to whom the disclosure has been made shall notify the SMART Co\u2011ordinator who shall ensure that an appropriate staff member is assigned responsibility for as many of the following as are appropriate to the circumstances: assessing the affected party's safety and well-being and any issues there may be for the safety or wellbeing of the University communityensuring\u00a0\u00a0that suitable support is in place for all affected parties and any other parties that may be involvedinforming the affected party of the right to contact Police and offering to facilitate such contactdiscussing with the affected party the issue of the need to seek medical treatment, and, where relevant, explaining the importance of obtaining and preserving forensic and other evidence (including digital or social media material that may be relevant)informing the affected party of their ability to seek to have protective measures or accommodations put in place, including options for, and available assistance with, changing academic, living, transportation, and/or working situationsinforming the affected party about resources available at the University and in the community, including advocacy and support servicesinforming the affected party of their options, including with reference to whether the matter is considered grievous sexual misconduct, and where appropriate seeking consent to initiate an investigation, and discussing with them any concerns or barriers to participating in the investigationoutlining to the affected party the applicable procedure(s) for University investigations, the range of possible outcomes, and privacy implications of proceeding with a complaint (see clause 5(d))explaining\u00a0\u00a0to any relevant parties that the University does not tolerate retaliation and that the University will take prompt action in response to any act of retaliationassessing whether the incident should also be referred for action under the Student Critical Incident Policy or Staff Critical Incident Policy, particularly where there has been serious injury to the affected party, or serious distress or harm caused to a group within the University community, andtaking any other measures that are deemed necessary or desirable. Appropriate staff may include, but are not limited to, Te Whare T\u0101wharau staff, Residential College staff, or a member of the Proctor's Office, taking into account clause (6(j) in terms of any possible future investigation.Having taken the appropriate steps under the previous clause, the staff member assigned responsibility for taking the steps under clause 7(a) will work with the affected party, in consultation with the SMART Co\u2011ordinator as appropriate, to determine the pathway(s) the affected party wishes to follow in addressing the situation (see clauses 6(b) and (c)), and to ensure that appropriate ongoing support is available to the affected party.Where an affected party seeks to raise a formal complaint against a student or seeks agreed protective measures, the SMART Co\u2011ordinator shall ensure that an appropriate staff member is assigned responsibility for providing support to the respondent student party.\u00a0\u00a0Appropriate staff may include, but are not limited to, a member of the Proctor's Office or Residential College staff, taking into account clause (6(j) in terms of any possible future investigation.\u00a0\u00a0Support should include: assessing the respondent party's safety and well-beingensuring\u00a0\u00a0that suitable support is in place for the respondent partyadvising the respondent about their rights to advocacy and legal representation, including support available via OUSA Student Supportexplaining that the University does not tolerate retaliation and that the University will take prompt action in response to any act of retaliationtaking any other measures that are deemed necessary or desirable.In the case of a complaint against a staff member, the Director of Human Resources shall ensure that the respondent is informed of their rights and obligations in relation to any investigation.\n8. Confidentiality, limits on confidentiality and requests for no action\nConfidential staff members may on some occasions have an obligation to pass information on, such as when there is perceived to be significant risk to the safety of the person making the disclosure or to the safety of others.In some cases, including where there is a significant risk to the University community, a situation may warrant formal University investigation even if the disclosing party and/or the affected party has not directly sought this.\u00a0\u00a0This may be determined by: the Director of Human Resources in cases where the respondent is a University staff member, orthe Vice-Chancellor, in consultation with the SMART Co\u2011ordinator, in all other cases.Where a decision to proceed with an investigation is made under clause 8(b), the Human Resources Director (or their delegate) or the SMART Co\u2011ordinator shall, prior to the commencement of the investigation, discuss with the affected or disclosing party: the reasons for deciding that the matter needed to be investigated, andthe means by which risks to the affected party, disclosing party or any other party arising from a decision to investigate may be managed.Subject to any requirements or expectations that may arise for members of the University staff, affected parties, respondents and witnesses may choose not to participate in University investigations, and have no obligation to cooperate or offer information or evidence.\n9. Protective measures and accommodations\nAn affected party, or any person acting on an affected party's behalf, may seek to have protective measures or accommodations put in place, being: measures available and approved under other University regulations and proceduresmeasures voluntarily agreed to by the affected and respondent parties (any agreement to such measures by a respondent party in the absence of a formal investigation shall not be considered indicative of an acceptance that sexual misconduct has occurred).measures imposed by the Proctor pursuant to their powers under the Student Conduct Statutemeasures imposed by the Head of a Residential College under College rulesmeasures established by the Director of Human Resources in accordance with the employment or contractual arrangements the University has with the party intended to be subject to the measures.measures which it is reasonable in all the circumstances to put in place to manage interactions and relationships between students who are involved in allegations of sexual misconduct, whether or not such allegations have been or are able to be established.Accommodations that may be available (subject, where required, to approval under other University regulations and procedures) include: changes to accommodation, access to counselling and medical services, voluntary leave of absences or withdrawal from paper(s)provision of Campus Watch escortsconfidential counselling through Student Health, Te Huka M\u0101tauraka/M\u0101ori Centre, ACC or the Employment Assistance Programmearrangements for students where study or performance has been affected, including: special consideration in final examinations or in internal work submissions, tests and assessments or withdrawal from a paper or papers\u00a0\u00a0(see the Examination and Assessment Regulations and the Special Consideration in Student Assessment Procedures)flexible class attendance or transfer to another lecture stream.as approved by Human Resources, arrangements for staff in the following areas: flexible working arrangements, including changes to start and finish hours or change of location or, in some instances, job assignmentleave to attend appointments or for other reasons related to the sexual misconduct.\u00a0\u00a0Leave can be paid or unpaid depending on the duration of the leave and individual circumstances and requirements.Protective measures imposed on respondent parties may include: no-contact ordersprohibition on attending events or being on campus, or otherwise limiting access to specified campus spacesmeasures put in place under Residential College rulesmeasures consistent with the respondent's employment agreement or contract with the University.Where the Proctor determines that protective measures should be imposed, any parties subject to those measures may seek to have this decision reviewed by the Provost, if they consider these measures are unreasonable.Any person establishing protective measures under the authority of this policy shall also consider whether the respondent should be encouraged to seek counselling, educational opportunities or other guidance or support in connection with the issues being managed by those measures.\u00a0\u00a0Any engagement with such support shall not be taken as acceptance that sexual misconduct has occurred.\n10. Formal Investigation by the University\nWhere the University conducts a formal investigation into an allegation against a student, the investigator who shall establish and conduct the investigation will be the Proctor or their appointee (an appropriate person appointed in consultation with the SMART Co-ordinator), or another appropriate investigator appointed by the SMART Co\u2011ordinator. The investigator shall ensure that the SMART Co-ordinator is aware of the investigation and the SMART Co-ordinator shall assign a team of at least two SMART members to deal with any relevant matters in connection with the investigation.Where the University conducts a formal investigation into an allegation against a staff member, the Director of Human Resources will establish an investigation in accordance with the applicable Human Resources processes. The Director of Human Resources may advise the SMART Co-ordinator of the investigation and invite them to appoint one or more SMART members to be available to assist with the investigation.The University will seek to complete investigations in a timely manner, taking into account the complexities of the case.\u00a0\u00a0Expected timeframes will be communicated to affected and respondent parties, and updates on any changes to estimated timeframes provided.Where a University investigation into a complaint about a student is commenced, and the process of investigation subsequently identifies that the alleged misconduct includes grievous sexual misconduct, the University will pause its investigation and support the complainant to raise the matter with Police should they wish to do so.\u00a0\u00a0All other provisions in this policy, including the availability of protective measures, shall apply.Subject to the following provisions, the process of investigation to be followed in each case shall be determined by those responsible for the investigation having regard to the nature of the complaint and the overall circumstances.An investigation into the behaviour of a student shall ensure fairness to all parties involved, including by: allowing any party who wishes to do so to have support or representation, andensuring that a party against whom an allegation is made is fairly informed of: fair detail of the allegation and of their right to be heardthe potential sanctions if an allegation is upheld, andtheir right to decline to participate in the investigation and the implications of this, including that the investigation will proceed without their input.An investigation into a person employed or engaged by the University shall be carried out in a way that is consistent with the requirements of the applicable employment agreement or independent contract terms.The person responsible for an investigation may consult with SMART at any time during the course of an investigation and, in the case of allegations against students, shall do so before finalising their investigation report. SMART may provide advice to the investigator including recommending that further investigation is undertaken before a report is finalised.Investigations shall conclude with a report detailing the investigator's conclusions which may include findings: that sexual misconduct has occurredthat sexual misconduct has not occurred or is unable to be proved to the necessary standard by the available evidence, orthat the investigation has been unable to determine whether sexual misconduct has occurred but considers the matter should be left open pending the possibility of further evidence becoming available.Following the conclusion of an investigation: interim measures that have been established for students remain in place unless cancelled by the Proctor or Head of Residential College on the advice of SMART, andthe Proctor, Head of Residential College or Director of Human Resources (as the case may be) may impose further or alternative protective measures which are considered appropriate to manage the situation on an ongoing basis having regard to the interests of any affected party, any respondent parties, interests of any others involved in the matter and the interests of the wider University community.In the event that the investigation has concluded that sexual misconduct has occurred: the Proctor may exercise their powers under the Student Conduct Statute to impose an appropriate penalty on a student or may refer the matter to the Provost for determination or further referral to the Vice-Chancellor, and/orresponsible Residential College authorities may take appropriate steps under Residential College rules, orthe Director of Human Resources may cause appropriate steps to be taken under a staff member's employment agreement or contract.\n11. University Actions where a Police Complaint is Made\nWhere a complaint is made to the Police and the matter is as yet unresolved through Police or criminal justice system processes the University shall establish such protective measures as are necessary to support the affected party.In cases where the respondent is a student, regardless of any outcome through the criminal justice system, the Proctor may determine that it is appropriate to continue to require compliance with protective measures.Where a respondent admits or is found guilty of sexual misconduct under criminal justice system processes, the University will, as appropriate and on the basis of that finding, apply its own subsequent processes under the Student Conduct Statute, Ethical Behaviour Policy and/or other relevant Statutes, policies or contractual agreements.In cases where the respondent party is a staff member, regardless of any outcome through the criminal justice system, the University reserves the right to complete any relevant Human Resources processes under the direction of the Director of Human Resources.\n12. Sanctions\nAny action taken against a student shall be taken under the Student Conduct Statute 2021 and/or Residential College rules.Any action against a staff member or independent contractor shall be in accordance with their employment agreement/contract, University policy and employment law and taken by those with the authority to do so.Nothing in this policy limits the University from imposing sanctions on a respondent where they have admitted sexual misconduct or have been found by a court to have committed acts amounting to sexual misconduct."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Sick_Leave_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Sick_Leave_Policy.html", "scope": "This policy applies to all staff, both Academic and General, of the University of Otago.", "purpose": "The purposes of this Policy are \u2013 \nAll employees, whether academic or general, are entitled to sick leave, the precise amount varying according to the individual employee's employment contract and the date on which they commenced employment with the University.

Drafting and Retention of Communications to StudentsSubject to the constraints of the communication channel used, all University communications to students should:be clear, courteous, accurate, appropriate, timely and jargon-free;contain the date;contain the author's name and position title and/or the details of the responsible department;contain the contact details of the person to whom enquiries about the communication should be directed, if it is not the author;be consistent with University policies and procedures;be appropriately retained in accordance with the University's Information and Records Management Policy.4. Departmental Responsibilities and AuthorityAcademic departments are responsible for: learning and teaching communications with their students;operational communications related to their students' working environment and the departmental administration of their courses, including communication of arrangements on days affected by adverse weather conditions (e.g. snow).Shared Services are responsible for: communicating with students, individually and in groups, on processes and information relating to the centralised academic administration of the student experience (e.g. enrolment).the provision of approval for the sending of eVision generated communications.the provision of approval for the sending of communications via AskOtago.Student and Academic Services are responsible for: authorising general information communications to be conveyed to students through the Student app or other email communication;serious incident communications involving individual students.Communications staff, acting as the Emergency Communications Team, are responsible for communications during a State of Campus Emergency, with the exception of announcements from the Vice-Chancellor or delegate, as per the Emergency Communications Plan.Staff members and units delivering specific services are responsible for: communicating with students, individually and in groups, on processes and information relating to their specific service;communicating on an individual basis with students who are engaged with their service.5. Student ResponsibilitiesStudents are required to check primary channels of communication regularly (at least weekly and preferably on each week day during teaching and examination periods) and to respond in a timely manner where necessary.Students should ensure they forward their student email to their personal email if that is their preference.Students are responsible for ensuring that only they have access to secure communication accounts associated with them and provided by the University; this includes their student email, student portal and Blackboard accounts.Students requesting personal or academic information by email should preferably do so via their student email address, as this shall be deemed to verify their identity.If a student responds to a staff email from an email address other than a University-assigned address, or provides an alternative email address for a specific purpose, they are required to reasonably monitor that email address for related University communications in addition to monitoring their student email address as per clause 5(a) above.The University does not accept responsibility for communications not being received by students where such communications are sent: via primary channels of communication; orto a student-provided alternative email address; oras a physical letter to a student's stated current address.Students are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date contact details in eVision, including their current physical address and next of kin/emergency contact details."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Student_Critical_Incident_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Student_Critical_Incident_Policy.html", "scope": "University-wide", "purpose": "The purpose of this policy is to provide a framework for delivering a timely, compassionate and coordinated response to critical incidents that pertain to students studying at the University of Otago.

Fees and Expenses\nFees and Expenses Where study is a condition of employment, and specified as such in the letter of appointment, full tuition fees and expenses may be granted. Where members of staff have been required to undertake study subsequent to their appointment the application for a 100 per cent grant must be accompanied by a letter from the Study Assistance Approver, which confirms that the applicant is required to undertake study.Where study is work related but is desirable rather than essential, 70 per cent of the tuition fee and expenses may be granted.Applications for Study Assistance relating to external tertiary providers will only be considered if the chosen course of study is not available through the University of Otago.Where an application to study papers for the Postgraduate Certificate, Diploma or Master in Higher Education is approved the grant will automatically be 100 percent and will be fully funded by the department.Applications for non-work-related study may receive a grant of 25 per cent of the appropriate fee provided that the applicant does not already possess a University degree or an equivalent tertiary qualification and, where possible and practicable, is undertaking this study at the University of Otago.Staff are automatically exempted from paying the Student Services Fee. This fee must not be included in Study Assistance grants.M\u0101ori Studies and M\u0101ori Language papers Given the University\u2019s commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the M\u0101ori Strategic Framework, HODs, Divisional Heads, and Deans are encouraged to support staff who wish to study 100-level papers in M\u0101ori Studies, and M\u0101ori language papers at all levels.Where an application to study M\u0101ori Language papers is approved, the grant will be 100 percent of the appropriate fee (30 percent of that will be funded by the Office of M\u0101ori Development).Where an application to study 100-level M\u0101ori Studies papers other than the language papers is approved, the grant will be 70 percent of the appropriate fee.Staff who do not normally meet domestic student status requirements, but do hold a permanent academic or professional staff role, are eligible to apply for Study Assistance at the domestic fee rate for M\u0101ori Studies papers delivered by the University.Fees and Expenses Limits A limit, reviewed annually and found in the administrative procedures on the application form, applies to all study assistance fees and expenses, with the exception of postgraduate courses in Health Sciences. Under exceptional circumstances, the Study Assistance Approver may approve a grant over the limit.Failure to pass papers An application for Study Assistance will not normally be approved where an applicant has failed to pass a paper in a previous year.\n3. Leave to Attend Classes\nStaff who are eligible for Study Assistance under 2(a)(i) may be granted up to two hours' leave per week to attend classes.Staff who are eligible for Study Assistance under 2(a) or 2(b) may be granted leave to attend classes as follows: Full-time member of staff: two hours' leave per week.Less than full-time member of staff: one hours' leave per week.Where necessary, leave in excess of the above allowances may be granted but the time must be made up.All staff who are eligible for Study Assistance under either 2(a) or 2(b) will, where practicable, be granted paid leave to attend block courses. Leave to attend block courses must be requested at the time of the application for study assistance.\n4. Guidelines for the Interpretation of the Study Assistance Policy\nStaff on leave without pay are not normally entitled to study assistance. However, in cases where staff commence leave without pay during a course of study for which they have previously been granted study assistance, the Study Assistance Approver may provide an exemption from this rule.Where the staff member's contract is due to expire during the proposed course of study, but their Manager/HOD is reasonably confident that a further contract will be offered, they may submit a recommendation for Study Assistance to the Study Assistance Approver.Any approval for MBA or DBA study (both internal and external) will require an undertaking from the staff member to repay any financial support pro rata should they leave the University's employment within three years of completing each course of study for which fees support has been given.Grants of 100 per cent for fees and expenses should be rare, and confined only to cases where study has been made a condition of employment in the letter of appointment, or subsequently required by the employer for the benefit of the University, e.g. to assist a department to meet Health and Safety requirements. Academic staff completing a PhD should receive a 100 per cent subsidy only if completion of the PhD was part of the job contract or a confirmation path objective.When considering whether study is work related or not the value of the degree or qualification as a whole should be considered rather than individual papers. Regardless, the particular papers chosen by the staff member must always meet with the approval of the Study Assistance Approver.The 25 per cent fee subsidy is intended to encourage staff members who have little or no experience of study at degree level to develop their potential, and their career within the University.The term \u201cexpenses\u201d relates to the cost of attending block courses for staff undertaking external study, e.g., travel expenses. All expenses must adhere to University financial policies. Heads of Department are encouraged to support their staff to attend block courses.Only in exceptional circumstances should staff be permitted to enrol in more than one paper per semester. Staff who are part time may choose to study more than one paper per semester in their own time, but will not be eligible to receive Study Assistance for the additional papers.HODs must ensure that staff who are studying have adequate breaks, and that the additional workload imposed by study is manageable and reasonable.For staff applying for distance study, the normal expectation is that any study undertaken will be completed within four years."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Testing_of_Portable_Electrical_Equipment_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Testing_of_Portable_Electrical_Equipment_Policy.html", "scope": "All workplaces of the University of Otago.", "purpose": "The University of Otago is committed to providing a safe work place for staff, students and visitors. \n\nAll identified equipment be checked as per AS/NZS 3760:2010 and the University Electrical Testing of Portable Equipment Guidelines.\nIt is the responsibility of departments to identify specialist electrical items that require testing by registered electricians or specialist services, such as medical equipment.\nEquipment that fails the electrical test must be tagged and removed from service for repair by an electrician.

In particular, the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from air travel on climate change should be considered carefully.Where a provision in this policy is inconsistent with the provisions in an employment agreement, the employment agreement will apply.\n2. Travel approvals\nBefore booking travel, travellers and travel arrangers should ensure that they have obtained the necessary approvals as required by their respective divisional travel approval processes. Domestic Travel \u2013 Expenditure for domestic travel is to be approved by the relevant cost centre Manager or approved delegate.International Travel \u2013 Staff and other University representatives must obtain prior written approval, that includes an estimate of costs and any external funding, for all international travel from: the Chancellor (in the case of the Vice-Chancellor and Council Members)the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee (in the case of the Chancellor)The Pro-Chancellor (in the case of the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee)in all other cases, the relevant member of the Senior Leadership Team ( SLT )As part of any domestic or international travel approval application, travelling staff members must have a contingency plan for work in case of disruption developed and accepted by the approver.\u00a0\u00a0Contingency plans are encouraged for other University representatives where appropriate.Should there be any unavoidable cost increases between approval and when the booking occurs, re-approval will not be needed. However, any scope change to the original travel request such as an additional route, additional accommodation, or different class of travel, will require re-approval by the applicable approval authority\n3. Travel insurance\nUniversity travel insurance is required to cover all international travel.\u00a0\u00a0In booking this insurance, please be advised that: While travel insurance currently covers medical costs arising from COVID\u201119, non-medical disruption insurance only covers up to $200 per day with a maximum of $1,400 in total (i.e. If the traveller is delayed or required to isolate due to COVID\u201119 at some point on their journey).The department/unit will be expected to cover any additional travel disruption related costs (such as accommodation, meals and transport) in excess of the $1400 travel disruption insurance provision outlined above for University travellers and therefore the approver should carefully consider the relevant risks and whether the potential costs can be justified.Staff and University representatives should also be aware of the possibility that permission to travel by the University may be rescinded at short notice if COVID\u201119 conditions change in New Zealand or overseas, and that insurance will be withdrawn if the destination country is placed on the Government's no-travel advisory before the journey commences.The risk level of each destination must be checked on the NZ Government website Safetravel. Where the rating for a country is: Do not travel \u2013 travel is not permitted unless approved by the Vice-Chancellor;Avoid non-essential travel \u2013 travel is not permitted unless approved by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head.Safetravel websiteOn receiving approval to travel, the Financial Control team, in the Financial Services Division, must receive notice from any University representative who is approved to travel to a \u201cdo not travel\u201d or \u201cavoid non-essential travel\u201d destination. This is to allow a specific travel insurance policy to be established covering the additional requirements imposed by these ratings. Email fsd.insurance@otago.ac.nz\n4. Air travel\nAll air travel should be booked in accordance with the University's Travel Planning Procedures.Travel should be booked well in advance so the expenditure is the most cost-effective available.Economy class must be used for all journeys for which payment of fares is provided by the University. Any exception requires the prior approval of the Vice-Chancellor, subsequent to endorsement by the staff member\u2019s direct manager and Divisional Head, or the approver specified under clause 2(a) ii 2-4 for senior University representatives.Where an external organisation has agreed to pay, or reimburse the University, for a university representative to travel at a class above economy, either by paying the full cost of the travel or the full cost of the upgrade, the University representative must provide evidence of this before the travel is confirmed.Staff and other University representatives are able to personally pay the cost of any upgrade above economy class on the condition that they provide evidence of their payment before the travel is confirmed and the upgrade does not result in any additional costs to the University. Payment by University representatives could include the use of personal air points or other personal rewards.The use of Airpoints or other reward schemes to purchase flights, upgrades, or other goods and services, cannot be reimbursed by the University.\n5. Visas, Inoculations and Passports\nVisas, individual country electronic travel authorisations (e.g. ESTA) and inoculations required for University travel will be funded by the University.Visas, electronic travel authorisations and inoculations obtained for any private travel undertaken in conjunction with University travel will not be funded by the University.Passport costs for either new or renewed passports will not be funded by the University.\n6. Travel club and reward programme memberships\nUniversity payment for membership of Air New Zealand Koru Club must be pre-approved by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Divisional Head, or by the approver specified under clause 2(a) ii 2-4 for senior University representatives using the Koru Club Membership Pre-Approval Request Form. Applications for university-approved Koru Memberships will only be considered where it can be demonstrated that the staff member or other university representative concerned is expected to make a total of nine return international or domestic trips on Air New Zealand each year as part of their University duties.Once approval has been obtained, this form should be attached to the PCard payment/statement in Finance One as part of the Koru Membership purchase transaction.University payment for membership of other travel clubs will only be approved where it can be demonstrated that for University-related purposes, the staff member or other University representative concerned has no option other than to spend considerable time travelling on airlines other than Air New Zealand or its affiliates, and can demonstrate that access to lounges or services as part of such travel essential to their health and wellbeing.Staff who are not eligible for University funding of Koru Club membership, may join in a private capacity and receive the benefits of the University's corporate membership. Further information can be found in the Air New Zealand Contract information document located within the Approved Supplier webpage.Air New Zealand contract information (PDF)The University will not pay for any travel-related reward programme, except where this is included in the base membership fee for an approved travel club membership.University funded memberships should not be for a period longer than one year as membership is personal to the individual and not held by the University.\n7. Accommodation\nStaff and other University representatives staying with relatives or friends as an alternative to using commercial accommodation may pay compensation per day to their hosts up to a value that does not exceed 25 per cent of the cost of commercial accommodation room rates per day in the locality where the staff member is transacting their University business.The University has approved the use of the \u201cAirbnb for work\u201d programme as an accommodation option.\u00a0\u00a0Bookings for this accommodation type must be made through the MTA as described in the Travel Planning Procedure.The University will not pay for mini-bar costs, other than in exceptional circumstances.The University will only pay the costs of laundry and dry cleaning where the business travel exceeds 14 days (excluding Research and Study Leave).\n8. Food and drink\nIn the absence of any contrary provision in employment or other agreements, the cost of meals will only be reimbursed or provided during the period that the staff member is away from their home location on University business.Guidelines on meals and alcohol are contained in the University's Sensitive Expenditure Procedure and Guidelines.\n9. Motor vehicles\nVehicles should be rented from the University\u2019s approved rental car suppliers using either the supplier\u2019s web reservation system (with payment made via the travellers\u2019 PCard), or via the University\u2019s MTA (which can be charged back to the University via the MTA\u2019s consolidated invoice). If the appropriate vehicle is unavailable, then from mainstream rental car providers at the most cost-effective rate.The most economical and environmentally friendly (i.e. lowest greenhouse gas emissions) type and size of rental car should be used, consistent with the requirements of the trip including the distance to be driven, the terrain and the number of people and type and quantity of goods being carried.Private use of a rental car is not permitted except in exceptional circumstances, such as reasonable out-of-work-hours use when the staff member or other University representative is away from home and undertaking work for the University. In such cases, the University representative must reimburse the University for any additional costs arising from the private use.The University will not pay for travel by private motor vehicle where travel by other means is more practical or cost-effective and has better or similar greenhouse gas emissions, such as flying or renting a vehicle. Where private motor vehicles are used for University business, staff members or other University representatives will be reimbursed at the lower cost of the rental equivalent (including petrol costs) or mileage.The use of taxis (including Airport Shuttle Services and ride sharing apps) should be moderate and cost-effective relative to other forms of transport available to the university representative.The University will not pay for taxis to be used for travel between the staff member's home and their usual place of work unless this is allowed for in the staff member's employment agreement.All fines for parking and traffic offences incurred by staff members or other University representatives while using a rental or private vehicle on University business will be paid by the staff member or other University representative. Under no circumstances will fines or other penalties be paid by the University.Staff are not permitted to use commercial e\u2011scooter services (e.g. Lime Scooters) for work purposes.\n10. Travel to/from the University representative's local airport\nWhen travelling to/from the University representative's local airport, the University representative is encouraged to adopt an airport transfer transport option that is both appropriate and cost effective.\u00a0\u00a0Options for transfer include the use of shuttles, taxis, ride apps, e.g. Uber, and the individual's private vehicle.\u00a0\u00a0When considering local Airport transfer options: (in order of preference) Travel by private motor vehicle to local airports which will be reimbursed to the shuttle equivalent rate and associated parking charges while the vehicle is parked at airport, or by shuttle.If the University representative is unable to travel to the airport in their car or the shuttle, the use of taxis or ride apps, due to cost, requires prior approval from the relevant authority as specified under clause 2 (a) above.\n11. Tipping\nThe University will only pay the costs of tipping in countries or localities where tipping is local practice and the tip is reasonable.Tipping in New Zealand will not be paid for or reimbursed under any circumstances.\n12. Communications while travelling\nThe University will only pay for internet or WiFi use where it is directly required for business purposes.It is expected that staff or other University representatives will use the most cost effective method of communication.Except in cases of emergencies, the University will pay for one phone call of up to 5 minutes in length or up to 5 texts per day to a staff members or other University representative's family.\n13. Private travel linked with University travel\nStaff members and other University representatives may undertake private travel before, during, or at the end of travel paid for by the University, provided that there is no additional cost to the University and that the primary purpose of the travel is business related.All the costs associated with the private travel, including travel insurance, must be paid by the Staff member or other University representative.Any work time used for private travel must be booked as annual leave before the Staff member leaves the University. When authorising annual leave, managers should consider the benefit of linking several activities together in one trip rather than creating more emissions by undertaking several trips.\n14. Persons accompanying University representatives\nUnless specifically provided for in other University policies, the University will not pay the travel costs of persons accompanying a University representative unless that person clearly contributes to the University business being conducted [by the University representative].Accompanying travel to be paid by the University must be pre-approved by the Divisional Head, with approval from the Vice-Chancellor or the Chief Operating Officer as applicable; or by the approver specified under clause 2(a) ii 1-3 for senior University representatives.\n15. Stopovers\nStopovers shall normally only be paid by the University if they have a clear business purpose or are required to make an onward travel connection that is part of the University travel.Stopovers to be paid by the University, other than those required to make an onward travel connection, must be pre-approved by the Divisional Head. Stopovers relating to the travel of Divisional Heads and other senior University representatives must be approved in line with the approval structure set out in clause 2(a) ii.\n16. Disputes procedure\nIn the event of a dispute relating to this policy arising between staff members and their Head of Department or Divisional Head, either party may refer the matter to the Director of Human Resources for review."}, {"policy type": "Policies", "name": "Treasury_Management_Policy", "url": "./output/html/Policies/Treasury_Management_Policy.html", "scope": "The policy applies to the University of Otago parent.", "purpose": "The Treasury Management Policy provides a framework within which the University can effectively manage its financial resources and minimise risk arising from treasury activities, and ensures investments and borrowings are made in accordance with legislative requirements including the Crown Entities Act 2004, the Education and Training Act 2020 and the Public Finance Act 1989. \nTreasury management responsibilitiesThe University Council has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that there is an effective framework for the recognition, management and reporting of treasury risks. This includes: deciding the level and nature of treasury risks that are acceptable, given the underlying objectives of the University of Otago and the Council's financial responsibilities and Section 281(1)(e) of the Education and Training Act 2020, andapproving the Treasury Management Policy, including any substantive amendments to the policy.The Vice-Chancellor has overall responsibility for treasury management through delegation from the Council. This includes approving authorised signatories and delegated authorities in respect of treasury dealing and banking activities (consistent with financial delegations approved by the Council where relevant \u2013 see clause 2(b) below).The Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) is responsible for the management of treasury activities through delegation from the Vice-Chancellor.

Finance and Budget CommitteeDelegation of authority and authority limitsOverarching delegated authority and authority limits are set out in the Council Delegations Schedule. Council Delegations Schedule (PDF)Treasury management duties and responsibilities outlined in this policy are reinforced through the delegated authorities listed in the Schedule of Financial Delegations. Schedule of Financial DelegationsAll delegated authorities and signatories will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that they are still appropriate and current.Whenever a person with delegated authority on any account or facility leaves the University, all relevant banks and other counterparties will be advised in writing in a timely manner to ensure that no unauthorised instructions are accepted from such persons.Annually, banks will be provided with a list of personnel with the delegated authority to undertake transactions, standard settlement instructions and details of personnel able to receive confirmations.University borrowingThe objective of the University's borrowing management is to provide on-going liquidity and funding support to enable the University to achieve its strategy. In the management of its borrowing, the University is required to manage costs and risks and to comply with financial ratios and limits on a current and prospective basis.The Council retains authority to review and approve all new loans and borrowing facilities, including the refinancing of existing lending facilities.Under section 282(4)(d) of the Education and Training Act 2020 the University is required to obtain written approval from the Secretary of the Ministry of Education to borrow funds. Therefore, any future borrowing requirements must be identified well in advance of the date they will be required to allow for the approval process. Education and Training Act 2020 \u2013 297. Bank accountsThe University will prepare regular financial reports and medium to long-term rolling cash flow and debt forecasts which enable it to identify its borrowing requirements.[REDACTED]Finance leases are tools that allow the University to accumulate debt-like obligations with an embedded interest cost. Alternatively, the University may be able to obtain a cheaper source of funds through its banking relationships. All proposed finance lease arrangements must include a 'lease or buy' assessment prior to any contract being approved.As a form of borrowing, finance leases must be within the Ministerial determination of 2014 and approved by the Council or, if outside the University's approved borrowing consent, require the approval of the Secretary for Education through the TEC . For further information and the full requirements refer to Finance lease information on the TEC website. How TEIs can enter into a finance lease \u2013 Tertiary Education CommissionOnce borrowing is in place, renegotiations of any new debt or facility should commence 12 months prior to the maturity date of the existing facility. New facilities should be executed at least one month prior to expiry of the existing. This renegotiation will follow the University's procurement policies and procedures, with reference to the terms of the relevant consents received from the Secretary for Education.Where TEC and bank financial covenants are in place and require ongoing compliance, covenant risk is mitigated through ongoing monitoring and regular reporting to the Finance and Budget Committee and Council (see also clause 12 of this Policy).The University does not offer security on its borrowing and derivative activity.Investment managementThe University's investment management aims to protect the value of the investment, provide liquidity and within this optimise the investment return of working capital for an agreed level of risk. Investments must be made in accordance with legislative requirements including Crown Entities Act 2004 and Education and Training Act 2020. For completeness, the provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004 which apply to the University are listed in schedule 4, part 1. Crown Entities Act 2004 \u2013 158. Bank accounts of Crown entitiesEducation and Training Act 2020 \u2013 297. Bank accountsAccurate cash flow forecasts will be maintained to ensure sufficient levels of liquidity to meet both planned and unforeseen cash requirements, and to assist borrowing decisions.The University has a commitment to ethical and socially responsible investing. Therefore, any equity and bond investment made must consider social good as well as financial return. The University should not invest directly in companies that are primarily involved in the production or distribution of alcohol, tobacco or munitions, or in the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. A measured approach should be taken with materiality issues considered.Investments permitted by legislation The Public Finance Act 1989 (section 65I \u2013 Investment of public money) requires that the University, as a Crown Entity, invests funds in accordance with the rules applying to the University's investment of public money. This allows Crown Entities to invest in bank deposits (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) approved by the Minister of Finance for the purpose; or in public securities or other securities that the Minister may approve for the purpose. The Minister can grant exemptions to these criteria (see 4(e) below).Investments permitted by exemption to legislation Subsequent to an exemption granted by the Minister of Finance, on 2 May 2011, to the University under section 65I of the Public Finance Act 1989 and section 203(4) of the Education Act 1989, investments can be made by the University in debt or equity securities in companies, in New Zealand or overseas, that are developing and commercialising intellectual property created by or on behalf of the University. This is subject to the following: The aggregate face value of all these investments (either in cash or cash equivalent) shall not exceed 2 per cent of the equity of the University group, measured against the most recent audited group financial statement for the University.There must be no contingent liabilities associated with any investment by the University, either by way of uncalled shares, guarantees or otherwise.Investments made by the University under this exemption must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor up to the limit of the Vice-Chancellor's delegated financial authority for capital expenditure and by the Council for amounts above this.Investments permitted as not covered by legislation The Office of the Auditor General, Treasury and the TEC have agreed that equity holdings or loans in companies involved primarily in providing teaching and research-related activities are not \u201cinvestments\u201d under the Public Finance Act 1989. The University shall rely on this arrangement to make such investments. Investments made by the University under this arrangement require approval by the Vice-Chancellor up to the limit of the Vice-Chancellor's delegated financial authority for capital expenditure, and by the Council for amounts above this.Investments in companies Equity investments and loans to companies that are not subsidiaries of the University must only be made if they comply with the conditions and approvals outlined in clauses 4(e) or 4(f) above.Investments in bank term deposits Bank term deposits are subject to relevant provisions in this this policy, including credit risk management (see clause 6 below) and requirements around banks approved under the Public Finance Act 1989 (as per clause 4(d)). The following additional provisions also apply: A new bank account may only be opened, and an existing bank account may only be closed, with the approval of both the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice-Chancellor.Investments of University working capital in bank call and term deposits beyond six months must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. If the Chief Financial Officer is not available then this may be approved by either the Vice-Chancellor or in their absence, a Deputy Vice-Chancellor.Investments held in working capital should be managed so that the balance held matches future expected outgoings as far as practicable with surplus funds being invested in call or term deposits.Investment instructions provided to the banks must follow the format on the Term Deposit Instructions Form. Investments are approved by two authorised signatories. Term Deposit Instructions Form (PDF)Term deposit rates should be sought from the registered banks meeting the ratings set out in clause 6(b) of this policy, and the best rate should be accepted for the University within the framework for investment in bank deposits set out in clause 6 of this policy.To ensure appropriate separation of duties, staff members placing funds on deposit should not be responsible for reconciliations of bank funds on hand.Transactional banking managementThe treasury function requires a centralised management of transactional banking and risk management. Transactional banking must be provided by an institution which complies with the terms of the Crown Entities Act 2004. Bank account operation and reconciliation requirements are detailed in the Bank Accounts Procedure. Crown Entities Act 2004 \u2013 158. Bank accounts of Crown entitiesBank Accounts ProcedureCounterparty credit risk managementThe primary objective of managing credit risk is to ensure that the University does not suffer losses due to counterparty failure that significantly impacts the financial performance of the University.The University will manage its credit exposure to its liquidity, treasury investment and derivatives activity by only transacting with approved bank counterparties. Unless otherwise approved by Council, counterparties will be New Zealand registered banks with a credit rating at least equivalent to one of: Standard & Poor's (\u201cS&P\u201d) AFitch AMoody's A2The below limits are relevant for all treasury investment, interest rate risk and foreign currency management activity: Counterparty/IssuerMinimum S&P (or equivalent) long term/short term credit ratingTotal derivative limit per counterparty ($million)Total investment limit per counterparty ($million)Total maximum combined limit per counterparty ($million)NZ GovernmentAA+UnlimitedUnlimitedUnlimitedNZ Registered Bank (per bank)AA/AA-25.02550NZ Registered Bank (per bank)A15.01530In determining the usage of the gross limits under clause 4(c) above, the following weightings will be used: Treasury investments (e.g. bank term deposits and call account balances) = Transaction principal amount.Interest rate risk management (e.g. swaps, Forward Rate Agreements ( FRA s) = Transaction Notional x Maturity (years) x 3%.Foreign Exchange Risk (e.g. Forward Exchange Contract) = Transaction Face Value amount x ((square root of the maturity (years)) x 15%).Counterparties exceeding the gross limits in clause 6(c) will be reported to Council (normally through Finance and Budget Committee), along with a recommended strategy to move back into policy compliance.Foreign exchange risk managementThe primary objective of managing foreign exchange risk is to mitigate against the adverse impact on New Zealand dollar ($NZ) expenses and purchases from foreign exchange rate movement.The University will hold foreign currency received from goods and services sold in a foreign currency in a denominated New Zealand bank account (the 'foreign currency account') up to an amount that covers: all forecast and known purchases of goods and services in the calendar year that the foreign currency is received, andany known, foreign currency liabilities and purchases that are unavoidable and will be paid anytime in the twelve month period following the receipt of the foreign currency (the natural hedge).The funds held in the foreign currency account may be sold where the University has a demand for cash.The University will sell forward all sales of goods or services denominated in foreign currency and not required for the natural hedge immediately when the sale becomes an unavoidable asset to the University.The University will purchase forward cover for all individual purchases of goods or services denominated in foreign currency and not covered by the natural hedge immediately when the purchase becomes an unavoidable liability or purchase to the University and exceeds\u00a0$100,000NZD in value. Purchases under $100,000NZD may be hedged at the discretion of the contract authorisers.The University will purchase forward cover for all liabilities denominated in foreign currency and not covered by the natural hedge immediately when the liability becomes an unavoidable liability to the University.For the purposes of clauses 7(e) and (f), any purchase or liability which is: included in the budget approved by University Council, oris recurring in nature and has been included in the budget approved by Council in each of the last five years, and is included in the budget that has been approved by the Vice-Chancellor but has not yet been approved by Councilwill be considered to be an unavoidable liability.When the settlement dates for foreign exchange purchase agreements are not able to be met, and the unavoidable liability still exists, the University will purchase the contracted currency and deposit those funds into its foreign currency account to be used when the liability falls due.The following approved foreign currency instruments will be used to manage purchase amounts in excess of goods and services sold: foreign currency deposit account amountsspot foreign exchange contractsforward foreign exchange contractsforeign currency swaps.With respect to Foreign Exchange Contracts: The value of foreign exchange contracts in place will not exceed the value of funds to be paid or received.Approved individual purchase orders for purchases in foreign currencies over $100,000NZD should be hedged where practicable. The approved purchase order, currency type, amount and estimate of the date of payment should be provided to the Treasury Asset and Insurance Accountant, Financial Services Division as soon as the purchase order has been approved. The Treasury Asset and Insurance Accountant will purchase a hedging contract with the bank and forward the details back to the relevant Department. This is the price the Department will be charged for the purchase of the goods.For regular annual expenditure items, such as library book purchases, membership fees and standard consulting fees, where the total of forecasted purchases is over $100,000NZD in any one currency, the contracts will be purchased by the Treasury Asset and Insurance Accountant when the budget is approved and as soon as market conditions become favourable.When the forecast dates for external foreign exchange settlements are not able to be met, the University will still purchase the contracted currency and will place the funds purchased in a foreign exchange bank account until the purchase is able to be made. Any interest gained on holding these foreign balances will not be available to Departments.For the avoidance of doubt, transactions of a speculative nature where there is not a legitimate underlying business cash flow being managed are not permitted.Funding risk managementThe primary focus of funding risk management is to ensure that debt facilities and drawdowns under those facilities can be rolled over and renewed in a timely manner and at a fair price.As far as is practical, the University will stagger the maturity dates of bank facilities in order to mitigate the risk of raising new or re-financing existing debt facilities thereby reducing exposure to adverse circumstances which may impact the availability or price of such funding. See also clause 3(h) on renegotiation.When actual debt amounts are at $20 million or above it is mandatory that the following limits apply for managing funding risk. The maturity profile of the total committed funding in respect to all core debt and committed debt facilities is to be managed within the below limits: PeriodMinimum %Maximum %0 to 3 years25753 years plus2575A funding maturity profile that is outside the above limits, but self corrects within 90-days is not in breach of this Policy. However, maintaining a maturity profile outside of policy limits beyond 90-days requires specific approval of Council.Approved working capital and debt facilities include bank overdraft and committed bank debt funding facilities.Interest rate risk managementThe primary objective of managing interest rate risk is to mitigate the negative impact of adverse changes in interest rates on the University's budgeted interest revenue and interest expense amounts.When actual core debt amounts are at $20 million or above it is mandatory that the interest rate exposures are managed according to the limits detailed in the following table. The University's forecast gross debt amounts must be within the following interest fixed/floating rate limits: Debt interest rate policy parameters (calculated on rolling monthly basis)Debt period endingMinimum fixed rateMaximum fixed rateCurrent40%90%Year 140%90%Year 235%85%Year 330%80%Year 425%75%Year 520%70%Year 60%65%Year 70%60%Year 80%55%Year 90%50%Year 100%45%A fixed rate maturity profile that is outside the above limits, but self corrects within 90-days is not in breach of this Policy. However, maintaining a maturity profile that is outside the above limits beyond 90-days requires specific approval by Council.Interest rate hedging activity with a maturity of fewer than or equal to five years with a value of $0 to $10m and within the risk parameters in clauses 6(b) of this policy must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor or any two Authorised Signatories.Interest rate hedging activity with a maturity of greater than five years, or over $10m and within the risk parameters in clauses 6(b) of this policy must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor or any two Authorised Signatories, one of whom must be either the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Operating Officer.Any hedging with a maturity beyond five years or which is outside the risk parameters in 6(b) shall require Council approval.Approved interest rate instruments that may be used in managing interest risk are the following interest rate swaps: forward start swapsswap shortening and extensions (must be approved by two Authorised Signatories, one of whom must be either the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Operating Officer) andinterest rate options on: Bank bills (purchased caps and one for one collars)Interest rate swaptions (purchased only)The forward start period on swaps and collars must be no more than 36 months from the deal date, except where the forward start swap/collar starts on the expiry date of an existing swap/collar and has a notional amount which is no more than that of the existing swap/collar.Any other interest rate instrument not listed in clause 6(f) must be specifically approved by Council. Such approval shall be on a case-by-case basis and may only be applied to the one singular transaction being approved.Credit exposure on these interest rate instruments is restricted by specified counterparty credit limits.For the avoidance of doubt, transactions of a speculative nature where there is not a legitimate underlying business cash flow being managed are not permitted.Liquidity risk managementThe primary objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet the University's financial commitments when required. Management must include allowance for unforeseen events which may curtail cash flows and cause pressure on liquid assets. The possible causes of a crisis in liquidity include: unexpected reduction in revenuesunexpected increase in operating expensesunexpected capital expenditurebusiness disruption[REDACTED]Committed bank facilities are only executed with those banks that have a long-term credit rating of at least A by S&P (or equivalent Moody's or Fitch) ratings.Operational risk managementThe University will have controls in place to minimise operational risks arising from human error, fraud, systems failures or inadequate procedures and controls. These will include: dealing authorities and limits \u2013 transactions will only be executed by those persons and within limits approved under formal delegation by University Council or the Vice-Chancellorsegregation of duties \u2013 no single person shall be permitted to deal/transact, authorise and confirm a treasury transactionregular management reportingregular risk assessment, including review of procedures and controls as directed by the Finance and Budget Committee, andOrganisational, systems, procedural and reconciliation controls to ensure: all cash management, borrowing, treasury investment and risk management activity is bona fide and properly authorisedchecks are in place to ensure accounts and records are updated promptly, accurately and completelyrisk positions are updated, reviewed and reported on a regular basisthe matching of third-party confirmations with immediate follow-up of anomalies, andany unresolved discrepancies are to be immediately advised to the Chief Financial Officer who will determine and/or approve any consequent action to remedy the discrepancy.The University will minimise legal risks (e.g. the unenforceability of a transaction due to an organisation not having the legal capacity or power to enter into the transaction or deficiencies in documentation) by ensuring all transactions are permissible under legislation and all significant legal documentation is reviewed and endorsed by legal counsel.Where the University uses derivative instruments for the purpose of reducing its exposure to fluctuations in financial market pricing, the accounting treatment for such instruments will follow PBE accounting standards or the equivalent for the public sector.Treasury reporting and performance managementIn order to determine the effectiveness and success of the University's treasury management function, compliance and performance benchmark measures will be reported by the Chief Financial Officer to the Vice-Chancellor, Finance and Budget Committee and University Council. These shall include: A monthly Treasury Dashboard Report, comprising: Asset management Income, expenditure and funds availableLiquidity risk position including availabilityRisk management Borrowing and interest rate risk positionTreasury investment maturity risk positionCredit and counterparty riskForeign currency riskFinancial covenants and TEC limit reportingMarket commentary and strategy updatePerformance benchmarkingExceptions ReportDerivative valuationsCash and borrowing forecast.A biannual Foreign Exchange Report, including details of: foreign currency cash holdingsforeign exchange risk positions and contracts, andpolicy compliance.A report to each ordinary Finance and Budget Committee meeting on the University's investment portfolio in terms of compliance with this policy.The Chief Financial Officer shall receive and monitor a weekly cash forecast report.Responding to extraordinary eventsWhere internal or external issues are identified outside of the normal budget cycle which have a capacity to materially impact the University's financial sustainability, the Finance and Budget Committee may revisit strategies in this policy and make recommendations to the Council to facilitate alignment and achievement of the University's operational and strategic plans.Policy reviewThis Treasury Management Policy shall be reviewed on an annual basis. This shall include a check for currency and fitness-for-purpose every year, with a more in-depth fundamental review completed every second year.The Chief Financial Officer has the responsibility for preparing a review report that is presented to the Vice-Chancellor and Finance and Budget Committee. The report may include: recommendation as to changes, deletions and additions to the policyoverview of the treasury management function in achieving the stated objectives, including a summary of breaches and one-off approvals to highlight areas of tensionanalysis of bank and lender service provision, and share of financial instrument transactionscomments and recommendations from the internal/external auditors on the treasury function, particularly internal controls, accounting treatments and reportingreview of the treasury spreadsheets/monitoring tools and procedures, andan assessment on the performance of any specialist external support.Amendments to the Policy require Council approval taking into account advice from the Finance and Budget Committee.", "content": "Some commercially sensitive sections of this Policy have been redacted.Ask a question about this Policy\nTreasury management responsibilitiesThe University Council has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that there is an effective framework for the recognition, management and reporting of treasury risks. This includes: deciding the level and nature of treasury risks that are acceptable, given the underlying objectives of the University of Otago and the Council's financial responsibilities and Section 281(1)(e) of the Education and Training Act 2020, andapproving the Treasury Management Policy, including any substantive amendments to the policy.The Vice-Chancellor has overall responsibility for treasury management through delegation from the Council. This includes approving authorised signatories and delegated authorities in respect of treasury dealing and banking activities (consistent with financial delegations approved by the Council where relevant \u2013 see clause 2(b) below).The Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) is responsible for the management of treasury activities through delegation from the Vice-Chancellor.

Finance and Budget CommitteeDelegation of authority and authority limitsOverarching delegated authority and authority limits are set out in the Council Delegations Schedule. Council Delegations Schedule (PDF)Treasury management duties and responsibilities outlined in this policy are reinforced through the delegated authorities listed in the Schedule of Financial Delegations. Schedule of Financial DelegationsAll delegated authorities and signatories will be reviewed at least annually to ensure that they are still appropriate and current.Whenever a person with delegated authority on any account or facility leaves the University, all relevant banks and other counterparties will be advised in writing in a timely manner to ensure that no unauthorised instructions are accepted from such persons.Annually, banks will be provided with a list of personnel with the delegated authority to undertake transactions, standard settlement instructions and details of personnel able to receive confirmations.University borrowingThe objective of the University's borrowing management is to provide on-going liquidity and funding support to enable the University to achieve its strategy. In the management of its borrowing, the University is required to manage costs and risks and to comply with financial ratios and limits on a current and prospective basis.The Council retains authority to review and approve all new loans and borrowing facilities, including the refinancing of existing lending facilities.Under section 282(4)(d) of the Education and Training Act 2020 the University is required to obtain written approval from the Secretary of the Ministry of Education to borrow funds. Therefore, any future borrowing requirements must be identified well in advance of the date they will be required to allow for the approval process. Education and Training Act 2020 \u2013 297. Bank accountsThe University will prepare regular financial reports and medium to long-term rolling cash flow and debt forecasts which enable it to identify its borrowing requirements.[REDACTED]Finance leases are tools that allow the University to accumulate debt-like obligations with an embedded interest cost. Alternatively, the University may be able to obtain a cheaper source of funds through its banking relationships. All proposed finance lease arrangements must include a 'lease or buy' assessment prior to any contract being approved.As a form of borrowing, finance leases must be within the Ministerial determination of 2014 and approved by the Council or, if outside the University's approved borrowing consent, require the approval of the Secretary for Education through the TEC . For further information and the full requirements refer to Finance lease information on the TEC website. How TEIs can enter into a finance lease \u2013 Tertiary Education CommissionOnce borrowing is in place, renegotiations of any new debt or facility should commence 12 months prior to the maturity date of the existing facility. New facilities should be executed at least one month prior to expiry of the existing. This renegotiation will follow the University's procurement policies and procedures, with reference to the terms of the relevant consents received from the Secretary for Education.Where TEC and bank financial covenants are in place and require ongoing compliance, covenant risk is mitigated through ongoing monitoring and regular reporting to the Finance and Budget Committee and Council (see also clause 12 of this Policy).The University does not offer security on its borrowing and derivative activity.Investment managementThe University's investment management aims to protect the value of the investment, provide liquidity and within this optimise the investment return of working capital for an agreed level of risk. Investments must be made in accordance with legislative requirements including Crown Entities Act 2004 and Education and Training Act 2020. For completeness, the provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004 which apply to the University are listed in schedule 4, part 1. Crown Entities Act 2004 \u2013 158. Bank accounts of Crown entitiesEducation and Training Act 2020 \u2013 297. Bank accountsAccurate cash flow forecasts will be maintained to ensure sufficient levels of liquidity to meet both planned and unforeseen cash requirements, and to assist borrowing decisions.The University has a commitment to ethical and socially responsible investing. Therefore, any equity and bond investment made must consider social good as well as financial return. The University should not invest directly in companies that are primarily involved in the production or distribution of alcohol, tobacco or munitions, or in the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. A measured approach should be taken with materiality issues considered.Investments permitted by legislation The Public Finance Act 1989 (section 65I \u2013 Investment of public money) requires that the University, as a Crown Entity, invests funds in accordance with the rules applying to the University's investment of public money. This allows Crown Entities to invest in bank deposits (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) approved by the Minister of Finance for the purpose; or in public securities or other securities that the Minister may approve for the purpose. The Minister can grant exemptions to these criteria (see 4(e) below).Investments permitted by exemption to legislation Subsequent to an exemption granted by the Minister of Finance, on 2 May 2011, to the University under section 65I of the Public Finance Act 1989 and section 203(4) of the Education Act 1989, investments can be made by the University in debt or equity securities in companies, in New Zealand or overseas, that are developing and commercialising intellectual property created by or on behalf of the University. This is subject to the following: The aggregate face value of all these investments (either in cash or cash equivalent) shall not exceed 2 per cent of the equity of the University group, measured against the most recent audited group financial statement for the University.There must be no contingent liabilities associated with any investment by the University, either by way of uncalled shares, guarantees or otherwise.Investments made by the University under this exemption must be approved by the Vice-Chancellor up to the limit of the Vice-Chancellor's delegated financial authority for capital expenditure and by the Council for amounts above this.Investments permitted as not covered by legislation The Office of the Auditor General, Treasury and the TEC have agreed that equity holdings or loans in companies involved primarily in providing teaching and research-related activities are not \u201cinvestments\u201d under the Public Finance Act 1989. The University shall rely on this arrangement to make such investments. Investments made by the University under this arrangement require approval by the Vice-Chancellor up to the limit of the Vice-Chancellor's delegated financial authority for capital expenditure, and by the Council for amounts above this.Investments in companies Equity investments and loans to companies that are not subsidiaries of the University must only be made if they comply with the conditions and approvals outlined in clauses 4(e) or 4(f) above.Investments in bank term deposits Bank term deposits are subject to relevant provisions in this this policy, including credit risk management (see clause 6 below) and requirements around banks approved under the Public Finance Act 1989 (as per clause 4(d)). The following additional provisions also apply: A new bank account may only be opened, and an existing bank account may only be closed, with the approval of both the Chief Financial Officer and the Vice-Chancellor.Investments of University working capital in bank call and term deposits beyond six months must be approved by the Chief Financial Officer. If the Chief Financial Officer is not available then this may be approved by either the Vice-Chancellor or in their absence, a Deputy Vice-Chancellor.Investments held in working capital should be managed so that the balance held matches future expected outgoings as far as practicable with surplus funds being invested in call or term deposits.Investment instructions provided to the banks must follow the format on the Term Deposit Instructions Form. Investments are approved by two authorised signatories. Term Deposit Instructions Form (PDF)Term deposit rates should be sought from the registered banks meeting the ratings set out in clause 6(b) of this policy, and the best rate should be accepted for the University within the framework for investment in bank deposits set out in clause 6 of this policy.To ensure appropriate separation of duties, staff members placing funds on deposit should not be responsible for reconciliations of bank funds on hand.Transactional banking managementThe treasury function requires a centralised management of transactional banking and risk management. Transactional banking must be provided by an institution which complies with the terms of the Crown Entities Act 2004.

As much as is practicable, staff will have equitable access to this Policy.Changes to working arrangements, such as entering into informal or formal working from home agreements, are a good time for staff to consider how they travel to and from campus on days they do not work from home.\n2. General approach\nThe University encourages staff and Managers/Heads of Department ( HoD s) to discuss individually and collectively, whether staff working from home is desirable and feasible for their area. Managers and HoD s are encouraged to be as flexible as possible without unduly affecting the performance of their area.All new buildings projects and major refurbishments will consider, during the design of the works, working from home options in order to reduce space requirements.Where staff are working from home for more than 2 days per week for a period of greater than four months, the HoD /Manager is expected to consider the efficient and effective use of office space.Where working from home arrangements are made, staff must be able to work effectively and have an appropriate work environment. This includes the ability to ensure information is kept secure and that all health and safety requirements are met. Recordkeeping requirements must also be maintained, and information created in a work context and held off-site returned to the University for storage and/or secure destruction, if employment ceasesConsideration must be given to the Working from Home Guidelines.Staff are also able to make a formal request for flexible work arrangements (under the Employment Relations Act) in accordance with the University's Flexible Working Request Procedure.The University reserves the right, following review and consultation, to cease any WFH agreement.\n3. Applications to work from home\nApplications to work from home will be managed in accordance with the Flexible Working Request Procedure. There are three pathways \u2013 informal, semi-formal and formal; the requirements for each are described below.Informal process The informal process is an arrangement with a Manager/ HoD and is used when staff are infrequently working from home (a day a week or less) or working from home for short periods (less than four months), for any amount of time.No formal documentation is required; however, it is recommended that a record of the arrangements (such as an email) is retained.The University is not expected to fund any home office equipment or set up.Semi-formal process The semi-formal process is used if the arrangement is for an extended period (more than 4 months) and/or is for substantial hours of work (more than a day a week).Requests will be made using the Request for Flexible Working Request Form and must be accompanied by a Working from Home Health and Safety Checklist.Managers/ HoD s will take the Working from Home Guidelines into consideration when reviewing these requests.All semi-formal arrangements should contain a review period. The review timeframe will depend on the circumstances but in most cases six months would be reasonable.Formal process A formal process is required under the Employment Relations Act.Formal requests will be considered as outlined in section 4 of the Flexible Working Request Procedure.\n4. Working from Home due to Unforeseen Circumstances\nWhere staff are required to work from home due to unforeseen circumstances and/or circumstances outside of the University's control, the University will consider the support and measures that are appropriate at the time, on a case-by-case basis.\n5. Health and safety\nWhen working from home, the home becomes the workplace and the usual health and safety policies and requirements apply to the University and staff.A self-assessment of the home office must be completed by the staff member when ongoing working from home is being contemplated. Occupational Health are available for support and advice as required: Occupational HealthEmail ohn@otago.ac.nzAll incidents and accidents, that happen in the course of carrying out work at home, need to be reported in the usual manner: University of Otago Health and Safety web portalACC will continue to apply to staff working from home, however only injuries sustained while carrying out work will be accepted as workplace injuries."}], "Procedures": [{"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Access_Framework_for_University_of_Otago_Records", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Access_Framework_for_University_of_Otago_Records.html", "scope": "This framework applies to all hardcopy and electronic public records created by the University of Otago that have been in existence for 25 years or longer, irrespective of location.", "purpose": "This document outlines the University information that is restricted from general access, the reason for the restriction, the period of time the restriction applies, and who will be responsible for making decisions relating to access for those records with restrictions. \nDeclaring access to public records over 25 years of age as either open or restricted is a compliance requirement under section 43 of the Public Records Act 2005.Many of the records covered by the restrictions outlined below ought to have been destroyed, under the New Zealand Universities Disposal Authority (DA*), before the restriction period ceases.

Access to University Holdings\nOnce a Record has reached 25 years of age, or when a record has been transferred to the University\u2019s approved archives repository, the Hocken Collections \u2013 Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena, that Record will usually become open and members of the public can inspect the Record. However, the University can impose conditions on access to a Record and this document acknowledges that, for a limited period, some types of public information created by the University should be restricted from general access.Access to any restricted public record over 25 years of age held at the University requires the permission of the Registrar and Secretary to the Council. Requests for access to restricted Records should be addressed to:The Registrar and Secretary to the Council Office of the Vice-Chancellor PO Box 56 Dunedin 9054\n4. Access to University Archives (Hocken Collections \u2013 Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena)\nAccess to University Records located at the Hocken Collections \u2013 Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena that carry a restriction period of between 30 and 100 years will be determined by the Registrar and Secretary to the Council, who will then notify the Hocken Librarian of the decision. Note that the initial query could have been generated from the Hocken as they can also receive direct requests to access University Records.Access to University Records located at the Hocken Collections \u2013 Uare Taoka o H\u0101kena that carry a restriction period of less than 30 years and/or relate to a current member of staff or student requires the written permission of the Registrar and Secretary to the Council.Access to the personal papers and teaching and research materials of University staff, while not considered University Records and not covered under the Public Records Act 2005, may be subject to the above restrictions at the discretion of the Hocken Librarian if they are found to contain confidential information relating to the administration of the University.\n5.

No other sub dissections should be used.\n3.Internal Recharging of Expenditure\nWhere an expense is incurred by one Activity Centre and they wish to charge all or part of that expense to another Activity Centre (which may or may not be in the same division) then the debit and credit should go to the same account in the originator\u2019s ledger. However, where the originating Activity Centre adds value to the cost before passing it on, the debit and credit should go to the internal income dissection. Please note, the sub dissection 70 (transactions within your Cost Centre), 71 (transactions within your division), or 72 (transactions between your division and another) is also required to complete the transaction.Marking up is not adding value. Example \u2013 no added value Activity Centre 10 WF C01 photocopies documents for 10 GF C01. The WF C01 photocopying costs accumulate in 10 WF C01 3115 00. The journal to charge GF C01 will be: Debit 10 GF C01 3115 00 - $100Credit 10 WF C01 3115 00 - $100Example \u2013 added value: Activity Centre 10 WF C01 photocopies documents for 10 GF C01 (in another division) but adds a cover sheet and binds the documents. The WF C01 photocopying costs accumulate in 10 WF C01 3115 00. The journal to charge GF C01 will be: Debit 10 GF C01 7775 72 $110Credit 10 WF C01 7375 72 $110\n4.Internal Recharging of Expenditure\nOperational Income and Expenditure (dissections 1100 to 7999): A bracket around a figure, or a minus sign in front of a figure, indicates that the figure is income to the University.A figure without a bracket around it or no minus sign in front of it indicates that the figure is expenditure to the University.Balance Sheet Assets (dissections 8100 to 8999) and Liabilities (dissections 9100 to 9899): A figure without a bracket around it or not minus sign in front of it, indicates the amount is an asset to the University.A figure with a bracket around it or a minus sign in front of it, indicates the amount is a liability to the University.Balance Sheet Equity (dissections 9900 to 9999): A figure in these dissections with a bracket around it or a minus sign in front of it indicates there are (positive) carry forwards available to the Activity Centre/department for its use.A figure in these dissections without a bracket around it or without a minus sign in front of it indicates there are no (negative) carry forwards available to the Activity Centre/department for its use.\n5.Accounting for Conference\nThere are several methods of accounting for conferences, depending on the type and nature of the conference: A conference which is run by the University, is community oriented and is open to members of the public. Any surplus or shortfall belongs to the University. These accounts should be set up using a K activity (e.g., K01).A conference which is run by the University and is aimed at university staff, external people, organisations, academics, and specialists. Any surplus or shortfall belongs to the University. These accounts should be set up using a D activity (e.g., D01).Accounting for a conference which is being run on behalf of another organisation and the surplus or shortfall belongs to that organisation. All transactions relating to this type of conference must be coded to the balance sheet (dissection 9259 \u2013 Agency Clearing Accounts Sundry). This is achieved by requesting the Financial Accountant to create a conference account.Amounts coded to the 9259 account must be GST inclusive.The University may not claim GST on any expenses for the conference and should not declare GST on conference income received. If the other organisation is registered for GST, then it must account for the GST and any other related taxes itself. The University is obligated to provide a fully summary of all transactions to the organisation monthly, so that it may appropriately account for its GST claims and declarations.Because the University is acting on behalf of the organisation running the conference, all invoices should be raised using the organisation's letterhead, and must not be processed through Finance One.To facilitate the payment of conference fees, departments can make use of the University of Otago Credit Card Gateway which provides a mechanism for departments within the University to process credit card payments as a link from their website. It provides a secure mechanism for conference attendees to pay by credit card and ensure compliance with the obligations the University has made to the banks that clear the payments. The Gateway is integrated with the University journal accounting system so allows transaction details to appear on departmental accounts. Payments received via the gateway can be credited to the 9259 conference account. Receipts generated must be in the name of the organisation.Cashiers will also need to be informed of the 9259 conference account to be credited.If you wish to use this facility, please contact: The Cashiers Office Tel +64 3 479 8228 Email cashiers@otago.ac.nzIf a University of Otago department (e.g. University Union) supplies goods or services to a 9259 conference, the department should request, via current processes, that an external AR invoice be raised via Finance One and income should be coded to an external income code (as the conference is regarded as an external conference). The department should further request that Revenue Management create an ARADJ journal for the amount of the AR invoice ( GST inclusive). The adjustment will credit the debtor (GST inclusive) and debit the appropriate 9259 conference account (GST inclusive).

Final submission will be in accordance with funding body and University requirements.\n2. Costing\nAll externally funded research must be fully costed, using the CCW, to define the true cost of undertaking the research, identify any profit margin that might be reasonable to be added for the provision of the research service, and minimise the need for cross subsidisation from other funding sources. Costing must be approved by the R&E Office before being quoted to the funder.Full costing will be based on the application of the University of Otago's current costing methodology as determined by DVC R&E. An explanation of costing principles is available on the R&E website.Costing of time for dedicated research and professional staff time FTE will use up-to-date academic and professional staff salary or hourly-rate schedules, with provision for annual progression and cost-of-living adjustments, available through the R&E Office. The resourcing of professional staff support for externally funded research must comply with the principles and authorities outlined in the University's Professional Staff Appointment Policy.The price offered to the funder will normally be the greater of the market value of the research activity or the full cost as calculated under (a) in order to maintain and protect the financial viability of the University. All applied price calculations must also adhere to the funder's guidelines/ regulations/ terms of reference.Any negotiation around costing with the funder must be handled by the R&E Office.The full cost of research must be identified in the CCW, even in situations where the University decides not to recover the full cost of the research in setting its price.While full cost recovery is desirable, the University recognises the need for flexibility in applying costing principles to externally funded research so as to match the needs and circumstances of the various funders, the University's strategic goals and the nature of the research.The undertaking of a research project at less than full cost should only occur after careful consideration of the factors involved.Examples of cases that may merit external funding at less than full cost are projects where the funder purchases specialised equipment that will remain the property of the University at the conclusion of the project, co-investment in projects that support the charitable purpose of the University, projects that directly support the teaching mission of the University, or projects that are pilot investigations for large fully-funded projects.Any, and all, costing and pricing documentation is internal to the University and must not be forwarded to the funder or any other party without permission from the DVC R&E or their delegated authority.The researcher must get approval for budgets from their HoD and the appropriate R&E Office staff prior to providing any costings to external parties (for example, funders and collaborators), with such approval being recorded on the CCW prior to the submission of the application.If necessary, the costing of research can be revised to reflect the value of the funding Agreement. Any adjustments must be made in negotiation with the Lead Principal Investigator and relevant HoD and the R&E Office.\n3. Consenting\nAs well as costing information, the CCW requires ethical and regulatory consents. The Lead Principal Investigator is responsible for obtaining these approvals.Once completed by the applicant, the CCW must be checked by the R&E Office and any changes negotiated with the applicant.If the CCW shows a difference between the calculated full cost of the research and the sum requested (price), authorisation is required from the HoD(s) and/or the relevant Dean(s) or PVC(s) (according to divisional delegation policies) to support the recommended waiver, and from the DVC R&E or their delegated authority to approve the waiver. This applies in all cases, including acceptance of funding from pre-approved organisations exempt from full cost recovery. If the shortfall is not a result of the organisation being one of the pre-approved organisations, a justification will be required.The final CCW must be signed or electronically approved by the applicant, the relevant departmental/divisional authority, the relevant Business Development Manager or Research Advisor, and the DVC R&E or delegated authority prior to submission of the application.\n4. Approval Delegations\nFor externally funded research, approval is required at both the costing and contracting stages. The two stages of approval are subject to different schedules of delegation, with costing delegations observing an established, devolved R&E practice, and contracting delegations abiding by the University's Financial Delegations Procedure and Schedule of Financial Delegations.At the costing stage, approval occurs via signing or electronic approval of the CCW by the DVC R&E or their delegated authority on the recommendation of the relevant PVC or their delegated authority. (Within R&E, costing approval is delegated from the DVC R&E to the Director R&E, and from the Director R&E to the appropriate R&E Office staff member \u2013 who is normally the Business Development Manager or Research Advisor working with a Lead Principal Investigator on an Agreement under development.)At the contracting stage, approval occurs when an Agreement is signed on behalf of the University by the DVC R&E or their delegated authority, who is normally the Director R&E. This follows the stipulations of the University's Financial Delegations Procedures and Schedule of Financial Delegations.\n5. Contracting\nA funder will normally forward an Agreement to the University when a decision has been made to purchase research or provide funding for non-exchange research. A standard University of Otago contract [Agreement] form is available from the R&E Office, though a funder will usually prefer to use its own form.A standard form, which is available from the R&E Office, must be used when the University is the contractor (i.e. when the University engages a subcontractor to deliver on a research project (e.g. MBIE contracts)).Agreements should contain: Full contact details for all parties to the Agreement;Statements on the ownership of intellectual property and publication rights;A statement relating to thesis submission (especially if a student is involved);A statement of confidentiality;A statement of governing law;A statement allowing either party to withdraw from the Agreement under appropriate circumstances;A statement on liability and, if applicable, indemnity;The date for the submission of the final report.Instructions as to the reporting procedure to the funding body during the course of the Agreement;The name(s) of the Lead Principal Investigator(s) or director of the project as well as the name(s), if available, of others engaged in the research and the department to which each belongs;Details of the budget (including whether the funding is to be exclusive or inclusive of GST);Method of payment and payment schedule (including invoice dates, if appropriate, and any requirements for payment (e.g. submission of report(s), a Purchase Order number, and so on));A term (meaning a start date and end date for the Agreement).The final Agreement is signed by a representative of the funder and the DVC R&E or their delegated authority on behalf of the University.Due to the dynamic and changeable nature of research, alterations to the protocols, procedures, timelines, milestones, objectives, etc. contained in the original Agreement may sometimes be necessary. Some changes may require the University to notify the funder by letter and to enter into a revision of the Agreement. Any renegotiation of Agreements must be handled by the R&E Office.\n6. Reporting\nReporting requirements vary between funders, and researchers should familiarise themselves with the particular requirements of their Agreement. Reporting guidelines and/or templates are normally available directly from funders, and a selection of guidelines and templates is also available from the R&E Office.All reports required by the funder must be prepared by the Lead Principal Investigator in consultation with the appropriate R&E staff member and submitted to the R&E Office two weeks ahead of the due date stated in the Agreement, unless otherwise agreed.The R&E Office will submit the report to the funder by the due date stated in the Agreement, unless agreed otherwise with the funding body and Lead Principal Investigator.\n7. Closing a Project\nAn externally funded research project has not concluded until the University has fulfilled all of its obligations to the funder, including any final reports, as defined in the Agreement.The research project must be closed in accordance with the University of Otago Research Project Closing Procedure.A Project Closure Form must be completed by the Lead Principal Investigator and returned to R&E for processing.Project Closure Form (PDF)The Lead Principal Investigator should outline on the Project Closure Form the preferred destination of any unspent funds, and identify the relevant University account if they are to be retained.The destination of unspent funds is usually determined by the Agreement. In many cases an underspend needs to be returned to the funder. If the Agreement is silent on the destination of funds, the matter will need to be negotiated between R&E (acting on behalf of the University) and the funder.Any over-spends will need to be covered by the University and are the responsibility of the Cost Centre associated with the research project."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Allegations_of_Misconduct_in_Research_Procedures", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Allegations_of_Misconduct_in_Research_Procedures.html", "scope": "These procedures apply to all staff and students of the University who engage in any form of research, and to those charged with investigating allegations of misconduct in research.", "purpose": "To establish procedures for the investigation of allegations of misconduct in research and to define the authority of those with responsibility for dealing with such cases. \nAll those involved in matters considered under these procedures are expected to act fairly and in good faith toward interested parties, who may include: the person bringing the allegationthe person or persons against whom an allegation is maderesearch students and staff working with the person(s) concernedthe Department(s) and/or Programmes(s) in which the research was conductedthe Department, Programme and/or Institution of the person bringing the allegationpublishers, actual or potential, of allegedly fraudulent workfunding bodies which have contributed to the researchhuman subjects of on-going or past researchthe public.", "content": "1.

This might include advice from Human Resources, the Registrar or other University professional staff to determine if the matter more appropriately falls within the purview of another University policy or procedure.Where the matter raised appears to the PVC to be one which would be capable of being resolved, and which would be appropriately resolved, through discussions between the complainant and the researcher, mediation may be recommended to those parties, but neither shall be required to participate in that process.After the initial discussions, and any mediation, the complainant should be offered the opportunity to decide whether or not they wish the matter to proceed. Should the complainant wish the matter to proceed, or should the PVC determine that it should do so, the matter must be submitted in writing to the DVC R&E by the complainant or the PVC as the case may be.If the matter raised appears to the PVC to fall within the purview of another policy or procedure, for example the Ethical Behaviour Policy or the Fraud Policy, the PVC will inform the DVC R&E and refer the matter appropriately.\n3.

The DVC R&E will ensure that such material is kept secure for those purposes and in a way that protects the interests of all relevant parties.A Preliminary Inquiry shall: be limited to an assessment of the information supplied by the complainant, any additional material sourced under clause 2(c), any response provided under clause 3(a)iii (bullet point 3), and experimental data files or other material provided under clause 3(a)ivbe completed quickly, preferably within thirty (30) daysbe conducted so far as possible on a confidential basis.The Preliminary Inquiry shall not purport to make any final determination but shall report to the DVC R&E the investigator's view as to whether: the matter is of sufficient seriousness, andwhether there is or is likely to be sufficient evidence to warrant holding a Formal Investigation.The report of a Preliminary Inquiry may also: make recommendations as to any steps that might be included as part of a Formal Investigation process, if one is warrantedsuggest any steps that should be taken to protect the interests of other parties, including steps that would involve disclosure of information regarding the issues being inquired intocomment on the way in which the matter was raised, including whether it may have been made without reasonable foundation or in bad faith.\n4. Actions on completion of the Preliminary Inquiry\nIf, in light of the report of the Preliminary Inquiry, the DVC R&E considers that no further action is warranted, the researcher and the complainant shall be advised accordingly. This outcome shall be recorded, and all information put forward in the process shall be managed in a manner that appropriately protects the interests of those involved.If, in light of the report of the Preliminary Inquiry, the DVC R&E considers that a Formal Investigation may be warranted, the researcher shall be advised accordingly and shall be given a copy of the report and provided seven (7) days to supply further written comment.After considering any further comment under clause 4(b) the DVC R&E shall either: determine that the matter be closed, in which case clause 4(a) shall apply, orproceed to establish a Formal Investigation under clause 5.The DVC R&E may also: determine whether there are other individuals or organisations that need to be informed of the circumstancesif concerned that the complainant has acted in bad faith, refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor for consideration to be given to action to be taken against that personrefer any other forms of misconduct that it appears may have occurred for action under the Ethical Behaviour Policy or other applicable policies.\n5. Formal Investigation\nThe DVC R&E shall establish an Investigation Panel of one or more persons to conduct the Formal Investigation in accordance with these procedures and under specific Terms of Reference appropriate to the relevant situation.The DVC R&E shall ensure the Investigation Panel is free from any actual or apparent bias and may make appointments to the Investigation Panel from within or from outside the University.As far as possible, Formal Investigations shall be undertaken on a confidential basis.If a researcher under investigation leaves the University before a Formal Investigation is complete it will nevertheless be completed in the interests of the integrity of the research and the potential interests of other parties.If information available to the DVC R&E calls into question the validity of one or more research publications the Terms of Reference may extend to the investigation of research beyond that covered by the Preliminary Inquiry.The Terms of Reference established by the DVC R&E for a Formal Investigation may allow it to be conducted without procedural formality but shall: clearly state the specific allegations which are being investigatedempower the Investigation Panel to require any member of the University to give oral evidence before it and/or to produce any material or other records in their possession relating to the matters at issue, and to require the researcher to repeat an experiment for the Investigation Panel where this is appropriaterequire that all relevant material which is to be available to the Investigation Panel is disclosed to the researcherentitle the researcher to meet with the Investigation Panel with the assistance of legal representation to present a response to the allegations under investigation.The Investigation Panel shall provide the Terms of Reference to the researcher involved and shall complete its investigation into matters in accordance with those terms following such reasonable process as deals with the matters expeditiously while ensuring fairness to all interested parties.The Investigation Panel may at any time seek amendment or extension of their Terms of Reference. The DVC R&E shall seek and take into account the views of the researcher before making any such change.\n6. Action following the Formal Investigation\nThe decision of the Formal Investigation will take the form of findings on any allegations made and recommendations to the DVC R&E as to action that might be taken.If an allegation is not proven: the researcher shall be entitled to have this recorded, and to have all information put forward in the process managed in a manner that appropriately protects the interests of those involvedthe DVC R&E shall give consideration to any redress that may be appropriate for the researcher.If the investigation suggests any allegation was made in bad faith, the DVC R&E shall give consideration to referring the matter to the Vice Chancellor for appropriate process to be followed.If the allegation is proven the DVC R&E: shall refer the matter if it involves a member of staff to the Vice-Chancellor for action to be considered under the researcher's employment agreement or independent contract or for other legal action to be consideredin the case of any matter involving a student, shall exercise any of the powers established by clause 5.7(b) to (f) of the Academic Statute 2011shall determine what information, if any, should be released, having regard to the interests of all concerned. This shall include determining whether funding agencies and publishers need to be informed that research and publications may have resulted from misconducted researchshall determine any steps that may be required to address the position of past and present co-workers in relation to the misconduct.\n7. Acknowledgement of misconduct by researcher\nIf at any point a researcher acknowledges that their actions represent misconduct in research the DVC R&E may suspend the operation of these procedures as they relate to a Preliminary Inquiry and/or Formal Investigation, and instead shall arrange for a report to be prepared recording the circumstances and the researcher's acknowledgment.A report prepared under clause 7(a) shall be supplied to the researcher who shall be: advised of their right to seek legal advice or other supportinvited to provide written acknowledgement of their acceptance of the terms of the report.If a researcher accepts a report in accordance with clause 7(b)ii the matter shall be dealt with under clause 6(d) on the basis of that report.\n8.Interim measures\nAt any stage of the processes under these procedures relevant funding agencies may need to be informed that an investigation is in progress. Any decision to make such disclosure shall be made by the DVC R&E.If at any time it appears to those undertaking a Preliminary Inquiry or Formal Investigation, or to the DVC R&E, that there may be grounds to suspend the researcher's employment, contract or enrolment while these procedures are followed, the DVC R&E shall refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor to be addressed in accordance with the researcher's employment or contractual terms, or enrolment status."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Ancestry_Verification_Procedures_for_M\u0101ori_and_Pacific_Students", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Ancestry_Verification_Procedures_for_M\u0101ori_and_Pacific_Students.html", "scope": "University-wide", "purpose": "The purpose of these Procedures is to detail University processes for verifying M\u0101ori or Pacific ancestry where such verification is required for special admission into restricted programmes, access to particular scholarships, or any other University initiatives for students which necessitate verification of ancestry. \nGeneral principlesVerification is not required in relation to ethnicity information provided to the University (e.g. self-identification of ethnic affiliation at enrolment).The University may require verification of ancestry where a provision, programme admission pathway, scholarship or other benefit is targeted at a particular group (e.g. M\u0101ori or indigenous Pacific Peoples) on the basis of ancestry.The University reserves the right to determine which provisions, programme admission pathways, scholarships or other benefits shall require verification of ancestry, provided that where such verification is required, this shall be a consistent requirement for all students to whom the benefit applies.No student shall be required to provide verification of ancestry, but access to provisions, programme admission pathways, scholarships or other benefits identified under clause 1(c) shall be dependent on verification of ancestry.Verification of ancestry in relation to any University process will be recorded in eVision, and will serve as confirmation of ancestry for any subsequent University purposes.Verification of M\u0101ori AncestryIwi registration documentation is the primary and preferred method of M\u0101ori ancestry verification and shall be deemed to confirm ancestry.A student who cannot provide Iwi registration documentation shall be required to provide a completed Whakapapa Endorsement Form endorsed by an appropriate independent party (the parents, siblings or spouse of an applicant may not provide endorsement).Assessment of ancestry shall be carried out under the authority of the Director, M\u0101ori Development, who may delegate the power to confirm M\u0101ori ancestry to appropriately qualified staff.For any particular case, where a staff member with delegated authority under clause 2(c) cannot confirm M\u0101ori ancestry on the basis of a student's provided documentation or believes ancestry is otherwise contestable, they must refer the matter to the Director, M\u0101ori Development, who will make a final decision.Verification of Indigenous Pacific AncestryWhere possible, students should provide verified official documentation, such as birth certificate(s), passport(s), citizenship papers, land title documents and/or death registrations, showing a traceable link to the student's indigenous Pacific ancestry.Where verified official documentation cannot be provided or demonstrates no clear link to indigenous Pacific ancestry, endorsement of the student's ancestry from an appropriate leader of a relevant Pacific Islands community group, such as a church minister, chief or elder, should be provided using the prescribed Indigenous Pacific Ancestry Endorsement Form.

General principles\nTo support compliance with the Privacy Act 2020 and the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement, it is the University's responsibility to ensure that, wherever possible, only staff members with a clear functional need to do so are able to access students' personal information.Operational responsibility for ensuring that only appropriate staff members are able to access student information in eVision resides with the relevant Head of Department.When assessing the need for a staff member to have access to eVision and/or associated Business Objects reports, the following question should be asked to inform the decision: To enable the employee to carry out the functions of his or her University employment, does the employee clearly need regular access to students' personal information and academic records?If the answer is 'yes', then access should be approved.If the answer is 'no', then access should not be approved. To enable the employee to carry out the functions of his or her University employment, does the employee clearly need regular access to students\u2019 personal information and academic records?Requests to create, change or remove eVision access for particular staff members, including access to associated Business Objects reports, may be made by completing and submitting the online eVision Access Form.The Manager of Student Administration has delegated authority to make a final decision on eVision access based on the criteria laid out in this Procedure.\u00a0\u00a0Depending upon the sensitivity and nature of the information being accessed, additional approval may also be required from designated managers with overall responsibility for particular sets of data.Staff members with approval to access student information in eVision may only access and use such information in accordance with the Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement.Where a staff member's access to information in eVision includes access to functionality that allows changing or updating information held in eVision, such functionality may only be used where this is authorised through the appropriate authority and/or clearly part of the staff member's functional role.\n2. Restrictions on access\nStaff members who, in order to undertake the responsibility of their positions, irregularly or infrequently need to access student personal information, should not be granted direct eVision access, but should instead access information via an Authorised Departmental Administrator.Student-staff members will not normally be granted eVision access.\u00a0\u00a0Where a student-staff member must access student information to carry out the functions of their employment, such information should be accessed via an Authorised Departmental Administrator.Notwithstanding clause 2(b), where it can be clearly demonstrated that a student-staff member cannot practically carry out the functions of their employment without eVision access, such access may be approved subject to the student-staff member signing a confidentiality agreement confirming that they have read and will adhere to the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement. Requests for eVision access for student-staff members, or for roles normally filled by student-staff members, should be made in writing to the Director, Academic Services.\n3. Removal of access\nWhere a staff member ceases employment at the University, eVision access will be removed via an automated updated at the end of their last day of work.\u00a0\u00a0For a short notice departure, or where a staff member's access needs to be removed immediately, their manager should contact the SMS Support Office to request this.Where a staff member is continuing in employment at the University but no longer requires eVision access as part of their role, their manager should remove access using the online eVision Access Form.Any staff member who has not accessed eVision within the last six months may have their access removed.A staff member's eVision access may be temporarily or permanently removed by the University where: It is deemed that they no longer require access to student informationthey have been shown to have accessed or used student information in contravention of the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement, orwhere the University deems that the staff member's continued access may pose an unacceptable risk to the privacy of students."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Bank_Accounts_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Bank_Accounts_Procedure.html", "scope": "This is a University-wide procedure.", "purpose": "These procedures set out the requirements of the Public Finance Act (1989) as to who may have Bank Accounts and the operation of same within the University. \nWho may operate a bank accountIn general, individual departments do not require bank accounts.

Following approval, once the examination begins, conveners are advised by an alert from eVision that provides details of the candidate and examiners, as well as links to key examination policies. They are asked to confirm that there is no conflict of interest in convening the examination, and acknowledge that any information received is given in confidence for use solely in relation to assessment of the thesis. In a separate email they are sent a link to a digital copy of the thesis and a Convener Recommendation Form.\n3. Receiving supervisors' and examiners' reports\nAdministrators in Student Experience receive supervisors' and examiners' reports directly, and will upload and enter the results in eVision. The Convener will receive a notification via eVision as each report is entered.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener receives reports directly from the supervisors or examiners, these should be emailed to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing.\u00a0\u00a0Administrators and/or the Dean of the Graduate Research School will follow up on any late reports, but may enlist the assistance of the Convener.The supervisors' report is for the Convener's information in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0It should not be circulated before the examiners' reports have been received. In the interests of facilitating an examination result, and providing the supervisors' report contains relevant context, the Convener may wish to make this report available to the examiners after all three examiners' reports have been submitted. The candidate does not normally receive a copy of the supervisor's report at any stage in the examination process.The examiners should report independently on the thesis; the content of the independent reports should not be shared amongst the examiners until all three reports are received.\u00a0\u00a0 Occasionally a substandard report (in terms of length, tone or language) may be received.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener is concerned about the quality of the report, they should confer with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who may request a revised report from the examiner.\n4. Facilitating the reaching of consensus on a result\nThe Convener is responsible for facilitating a consensus amongst the examiners on the result of the examination and any required amendments.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the Convener may need to take on an adjudicating role in order to assist this process, for example through assessing the evidence being presented by examiners' for their positions, but at no time should the Convener become involved in judging the quality of the thesis itself (this is the role of the examiners).Possible outcomes from the examination are recommendations that the thesis: be accepted as is, and the degree be awarded;be accepted with minor editorial corrections, and the degree be awarded;be accepted and the degree be awarded after amendments have been made to the satisfaction of the Convener of examiners in consultation with the internal examiner;be revised and resubmitted for examination;be rejected and referred to the appropriate authority within the University for consideration of the award of another degree; or,be rejected with no right of resubmission.The following steps may be taken to reach a consensus: circulating the examiners' reports and outlining the available options and/or a possible way forward;discussing the situation individually with one or all of the examiners, or chairing an audio or web conference with all the examiners;in exceptional circumstances, following consultation with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, seeking clarification from the supervisor(s) about specific aspects of the thesis. For example, the thesis may contain co-authored published material and the examiners may want clarification over the contribution of the candidate and the co-authors.A decision should also be made on whether the examiners recommend the thesis be nominated for 'exceptional' status (in the top 10% of theses examined).\u00a0\u00a0Such a recommendation requires that all three examiners agree that the thesis is of exceptional quality, which may be demonstrated through initial examiner recommendations or through written examiner statements confirming this recommendation following discussion.\u00a0\u00a0Each examiner should provide brief written reasons for their judgment that the thesis is exceptional.If a consensus on a result cannot be reached, the Convener should contact the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who will advise on next steps, for example the appointment of a referee.Once consensus is reached, the Convener should draft a letter for the candidate, containing the result and required amendments, and circulate this around the examiners for final confirmation.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notifying the result\nThe Convener should email the recommendation for the result on the prescribed form, along with a letter to the candidate (see 4(f) above), to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing. The Administrators in Student Experience will send this letter to the candidate with copies to the primary supervisor.For an 'Accept' result (see 4(b)I, ii and iii) the Administrators at Student Experience will formally advise the candidate of the result via an alert from eVision; the Convener's letter and the examiners' reports will be sent to the candidate and copied to the primary supervisor.\u00a0\u00a0The Convener may also inform the candidate of the result prior to formal notification being sent.For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 4(b)iv,) the Dean of the Graduate Research School will normally liaise with the candidate's primary supervisor, who shall inform the candidate of the result in person.\u00a0\u00a0 The Convener's letter and anonymised copies of examiners' reports will be emailed to the primary supervisor to share with the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, and the head of the supervising department.\u00a0\u00a0This process is intended to provide additional support to the candidate.For a 'Reject' result (see 4(b) v and vi) the Dean of the Graduate Research School shall manage communications to the candidate.\u00a0\u00a0The result letter, the Convener's letter and copies of examiners' reports will be provided to the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, the Primary Supervisor and the head of the supervising department. The candidate will also be advised of the process to seek leave to appeal.Where the result includes amendments or revisions, the Convener should be available to the candidate to provide clarification on the nature and scope of additional work required.A candidate has the right to seek leave to appeal if they believe there has been an unfair examination process.\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approving the required corrections or amendments\nFor an 'Accept' result (see 4(b)ii and iii), the Convener is responsible for ensuring that any required corrections or amendments have been completed. For this result the candidate should submit the corrected thesis directly to the Convener. The Convener should confirm with the candidate the format in which they would prefer the amended thesis (electronic, hard copy or both).For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 4(b)iv), the thesis will be fully re-examined, preferably with the same examiners and Convener; in this case the candidate will work on revisions under the guidance of their supervisor(s) and the candidate should submit their revised thesis and a separate summary of changes made to phd@otago.ac.nz; the Convener will not be required until the thesis is resubmitted.Where minor corrections are required (see 4(b)ii), the Convener is solely responsible for checking that these have been made.Where amendments are required (see 4(b)iii), the Convener is responsible for checking that these have been made in consultation with the internal examiner. Note that the internal examiner is expected to check that the amendments agreed to by the examination panel are addressed; any specific concerns of the internal examiner should not be given undue weight in this process.Once any corrections or amendments required by the examiners have been completed and the Convener is happy that all amendments have been made, an email should be sent to phd@otago.ac.nz with the following text and the Administrators at Student Experience will enter the result and upload the email to eVision.

Following approval, once the examination begins, conveners are advised by an alert from eVision that provides details of the candidate and examiners, as well as links to key examination policies. They are asked to confirm that there is no conflict of interest in convening the examination, and acknowledge that any information received is given in confidence for use solely in relation to assessment of the thesis. In a separate email they are sent a link to a digital copy of the thesis, as well as word documents of the Oral Examination Briefing Report and Convener Recommendation Form.The Convener should find out from the supervising department who is providing administrative support for the examination process. Normally an Administrator from the supervising department would assist in liaising with examiners for logistical aspects of the examination, such as the timing of the oral examination.\n3. Overview of the examination process and role of the oral examination\nAn oral examination is normally held as part of the examination process for the degrees of PhD , DMA and DBA ; an EdD may include an oral. If the candidate first enrolled for their doctorate in 2013 or earlier, they may not be required to have an oral examination.The convening procedure for Doctoral examinations that have an oral includes five steps: initial organisation of oral examinationreceiving supervisor and examiner reports and finalising details for the oral examinationholding the oral examination and facilitating a consensus resultnotifying the resultapproving required corrections or amendmentsThe main objectives of the oral examination are to: celebrate the work of the candidate from a position of appreciative inquiryprovide the candidate with a special opportunity to discuss their work in depth and defend their thesis;establish that the candidate fully understands the work and its wider implications;provide the candidate with an opportunity to reply to criticism or challenge;enable the examiners to clarify issues in the thesis which may be unclear;allow for discussion of publication opportunities arising from the research;help the examiners to decide on the nature and extent of any corrections or revisions which may be required;provide the examiners with an opportunity to clearly communicate required corrections or revisions to the candidate; and,allow the examiners to reach agreement on an examination result, including confirming whether the thesis should be recommended as an 'exceptional thesis'.The oral examination should normally include assessment of the candidate's ability to: display detailed knowledge of the thesis;locate their research in the broader context of their discipline;demonstrate the originality of the thesis and the contribution it makes to knowledge;defend the methodology and conclusions of the thesis;display awareness of the limitations of the thesis; and,authenticate the work (i.e. prove that it is their own work).The oral examination is normally conducted in English or Te Reo. It is not the purpose of an oral examination to test the candidate's command of spoken English or Te Reo; this is particularly important for candidates whose first language is not English or Te Reo and for some candidates with disabilities.\n4. Initial organisation of the oral examination\nThe Convener, with the administrative support of the candidate's supervising department, should make arrangements for the oral examination.The date for the oral should be set once the examination has started, and pencilled in for about 12 weeks later.The oral examination is attended by: the Convener (in the Chair);the candidate; and,at least two of the examiners (typically the Internal Examiner and the New Zealand External Examiner); at the discretion of the Convener, the third examiner may also attend. If the examiners are in disagreement as to whether the candidate should pass, all three examiners must be invited to attend the oral examination.Following consultation with the candidate, the Convener may also elect to invite to the oral examination: the candidate's supervisors (to whom the Convener may address questions during the oral examination);the candidate's Head of Department or senior academic with relevant expertise (to whom the Convener may address questions during the oral examination); and,other parties as deemed appropriate, for example a support person for the candidate (such parties will not usually contribute to any discussions, but see 6(g)).The oral examination will normally be held on a University of Otago campus, and participants can either attend in person, or join by an audio or video conference link. If the candidate is joining by an audio or video link, this should occur from a site with reliable connectivity and privacy.The format of the oral examination will normally include: a brief presentation by the candidate (no more than 10-15 minutes);questions from the examiners on substantive issues communicated to the candidate in advance;other questions;free discussion; and,opportunity for questions or comments by the candidate.\n5. Receiving supervisors' and examiners' reports and finalising details for the oral examination\nAdministrators in Student Experience receive supervisors' and examiners' reports directly, and will upload and enter the results in eVision. The Convener will receive a notification via eVision as each report is entered.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener receives reports directly from the supervisors or examiners, these should be emailed to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing.\u00a0\u00a0Administrators and/or the Dean of the Graduate Research School will follow up on any late reports, but may enlist the assistance of the Convener.The supervisors' report is for the Convener's information in the first instance.\u00a0\u00a0It should not be circulated before the examiners' reports have been received. In the interests of facilitating an examination result, and providing the supervisors' report contains relevant context, the Convener may wish to make this report available to the examiners after all three examiners' reports have been submitted. The candidate does not normally receive a copy of the supervisor's report at any stage in the examination process.The examiners should report independently on the thesis; the content of the independent reports should not be shared amongst the examiners until all three reports are received.\u00a0\u00a0 Occasionally a substandard report (in terms of length, tone or language) may be received.\u00a0\u00a0If the Convener is concerned about the quality of the report, they should confer with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who may request a revised report from the examiner.The oral examination must not normally be held until two weeks after all the examiners' written reports on the thesis have been submitted and circulated to the candidate. If getting close to the date for the oral examination and all the examiner reports have not been received, the Convener should contact dean.grs@otago.ac.nz for assistance in getting any remaining reports submitted.Prior to the oral examination, the Convener should circulate copies of the examiner reports to each examiner to assist the examiners in determining a preliminary consensus view and agreement over the main issues to be discussed in the oral examination. Liaison with examiners could occur by email, audio visual conference, or in a pre-meeting immediately prior to the start of the oral examination. If the initial recommendation of the examiners prior to an oral examination is that the thesis be revised and resubmitted for examination, an oral examination is normally deferred until the re-examination.Regardless of whether all examiners attend, the Convener should ensure the range of views on the adequacy of the thesis are represented at the oral examination.Once arrangements are finalised, the Convener should complete the Oral Examination Briefing Report. The Convener should identify by name all those who will be present in the oral examination (i.e. the names of the examiners who will be present can be disclosed at this point). The Convener should email: the Oral Examination Briefing Report, to phd@otago.ac.nz; and,the Oral Examination Briefing Report and copies of the examiners' reports to the candidate, the supervisors, and the examiners, at least two weeks prior to the oral examination.\n6. Holding the oral examination and facilitating a consensus result\nThe Convener chairs the oral examination, which typically takes between one and three hours.Prior to the start of the examination (either by email or by a pre-meeting), the Convener should ensure the format of the examination is discussed with the examiners, and decide who will ask questions of any absent examiner.The Convener welcomes all participants and ensures introductions are made.The candidate provides a brief (no more than 10-15 minutes) presentation and may use this opportunity to address examiner concerns.The Convener oversees questioning by the examiners, trying to ensure no one dominates the questioning.Once questioning is complete, the Convener may ask the candidate if they have any questions for the examiners or any comments to make.The Convener asks the candidate, supervisors and any support people for the candidate to leave the room. On occasion, the Convener may ask the supervisors to remain behind to respond to questions the examiners may have.The Convener facilitates a consensus among the examiners on the result of the examination and any required amendments.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the Convener may need to take on an adjudicating role in order to assist this process, for example through assessing the evidence being presented by examiners' for their positions, but at no time should the Convener become involved in judging the quality of the thesis itself (this is the role of the examiners).Possible outcomes from the examination are recommendations that the thesis: be accepted as is;be accepted with minor editorial corrections, and the degree be awarded;be accepted and the degree be awarded after amendments have been made to the satisfaction of the Convener of examiners in consultation with the internal examiner;be revised and resubmitted for examination;be rejected and referred to the appropriate authority within the University for consideration of the award of another degree; or,be rejected with no right of resubmission.A decision should also be made on whether the examiners recommend the thesis be nominated for 'exceptional' status (in the top 10 per cent of theses examined).\u00a0\u00a0Such a recommendation requires that all three examiners agree that the thesis is of exceptional quality, which may be demonstrated through initial examiner recommendations or through written examiner statements confirming this recommendation following discussion and/or an oral examination. The Convener needs to provide commentary to back up the recommendation. The Convener must not disclose the recommendation to the candidate or supervisors, as the final decision to grant exceptional status resides with the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor.Following the deliberations of the Convener and examiners, the Convener invites the candidate, supervisors and support people back into the room. The Convener then verbally communicates the recommended result and may briefly outline any required corrections or revisions, noting that further details will be provided in a letter for the candidate. This is not an opportunity for the candidate to challenge the result, although they may seek clarification on the nature of required amendments to the thesis.If a consensus on a result cannot be reached, the Convener should contact the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who will advise on next steps, for example the appointment of a referee.Once consensus is reached, the Convener should draft a letter for the candidate, containing the result and required amendments (this may refer to particular (or all) examiner reports), and circulate this around the examiners for final confirmation.\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notifying the result\nAs noted in 6(k) above, the Convener may relay the recommended result to the candidate at the conclusion of the oral examination.The Convener should email the recommendation for the result on the prescribed form, along with a letter to the candidate (see 6(m) above), to phd@otago.ac.nz for processing. The Administrators at Student Experience will send this letter to the candidate with copies to the primary supervisor.For an 'Accept' result (see 6(h)i, ii and iii) the Administrators at Student Experience will formally advise the candidate of the result via an alert from eVision; the Convener's letter and the examiners' reports will be sent to the candidate and copied to the primary supervisor. The Convener may also inform the candidate of the result prior to formal notification being sent.For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 6(h)iv) the Dean of the Graduate Research School will normally liaise with the candidate's primary supervisor. The Convener's letter and anonymised copies of examiners' reports will be emailed to the primary supervisor to share with the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, and the Head of Department. This process is intended to provide additional support to the candidate.For a 'Reject' result (see 6(h) v and vi) the Dean of the Graduate Research School shall manage communications to the candidate. The result letter, the Convener's letter and copies of examiners' reports will be provided to the candidate, and documents will be copied to the Convener, the Primary Supervisor and the Head of Department. The candidate will also be advised of the process to seek leave to appeal.Where the result includes amendments or revisions, the Convener should be available to the candidate to provide clarification on the nature and scope of additional work required.A candidate has the right to seek leave to appeal if they believe there has been an unfair examination process.\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approving required corrections or amendments\nFor an 'Accept' result (see 6(h)ii and iii), the Convener is responsible for ensuring that any required corrections or amendments have been completed. For this result the candidate should submit the corrected thesis directly to the Convener. The Convener should confirm with the candidate the format in which they would prefer the amended thesis (electronic, hard copy or both).For a 'Revise and Resubmit' result (see 6(h)iv) the thesis will be fully re-examined, preferably with the same examiners and Convener; in this case the candidate will work on revisions under the guidance of their supervisor(s) and the candidate should submit their revised thesis and a separate summary of changes made to phd@otago.ac.nz; the Convener will not be required until the thesis is resubmitted.Where minor corrections are required (see 6(h)ii), the Convener is solely responsible for checking that these have been made.Where amendments are required (see 6(h)iii), the Convener is responsible for checking that these have been made in consultation with the internal examiner.

The CCW is prepared on a full cost basis, meaning all the direct and indirect costs are included, to determine the budgeted contribution the project is to make to the University.\nPricing\nCommercial projects have a profit element. The contracted price must be greater than the total cost of the project.\nOverhead waiver\nThe CCW allows the PI to recommend the waiver of overhead. Department overhead waivers are approved by the Head of Department (HOD) and Central overhead waivers by the DVC Research and Enterprise.  In the case of Health Sciences' projects, overhead waiver requests must be approved by the Dean or PVC in addition to the HOD.\nOverheads may only be waived if there is a clear and substantiated benefit to the University. Benefits may be tangible or intangible but should be expressed as an amount and compared to the value of the overhead waived.\nContracting\nA contract for each commercial project is required. Only the DVC Research and Enterprise, or delegate, may approve and sign a contract with a third party. The relationship is between the University and the contracting party.  Undertaking an activity outside of the contractual relationship can create legal and insurance issues. For example, the activity will fall outside of the University's insurance policy and may result in personal liability for the individual conducting the project.\nSet up in Finance One\nA commercial project is set up in the Finance One system as an E Activity Type. Completed applications to open an E Activity are signed by the HOD and sent to the Financial Accountant along with a copy of the last page of the CCW showing the summary budget and sign-offs. Spending must not take place prior to the activation of the E Activity, and all costs and revenue associated with the project must be recorded against the Activity.\nIf a new commercial project commences outside of the budget or budget review periods, Financial Services will open up the E Activity, but no budget may be loaded. A budget is still required, and will be loaded at the next budget or budget review round.\nProcedures followed during the life of the project\nThe following procedures are completed during the period the project is active through to its conclusion.\nProject monitoring\nDepartments are required to perform basic project administration including:\n\nInvoicing customers according to the requirements of the contract\nAll work must be completed at the contract price\nRecording indirect salary costs to the project by journal entry\nMonitoring project end dates to ensure that projects are completed and accounts closed in a timely manner\n\nIn addition to these administrative tasks, the Department needs to:\n\nVerify that overhead is calculated properly and any amount calculated over the waived amount is charged to the project\nRequest a rate change to the project when the commercial overhead rate changes and the project can bear the higher rate\nEnsure that projects continue to be viable. Where the planned return is unlikely to be achieved, the HOD and the Research Office should be informed, and a solution identified. Solutions may include an approach to the customer for additional funding, change in approach to the project or other opportunities\n\nCommercial surplus transfer and project closing\nThe Research and Enterprise website hosts transfer and closing forms that are completed to either transfer a surplus during the life of the project or to request a balance transfer and project closing at the conclusion of the project. Surpluses may not be transferred to another commercial project, an external research account (P or Q Activities), or a research committee account (R Activity).\nAt the project conclusion, the Department\n\nVerifies that all invoicing is complete and in accordance with the contract\nEnsures all indirect salaries and other costs are recorded\nMakes a comparison of actual results to budget\nCalculates overhead on a life to date basis to ensure that the correct amount based on actual salary costs has been charged and:     \nCharges overhead if the calculated amount exceeds the amount waived.\nRecovers overhead on projects with an overhead waiver when the project finishes in a surplus. The amount recovered is agreed between the Head of the Department and the Principal Investigator.\n\n\nProject deficits are followed up with the Principal Investigator and the Head of Department. A discussion should be held with the Research and Enterprise Office to determine the potential of recovering additional costs from the customer\n\nForms may be completed by the Department Administrator but must be signed by the Principal Investigator and the Head of Department.

This Report shows the net results for the Cost Centre and variance analysis is prepared to explain performance against budget.Should a department require a General Ledger Transaction Listing Report, please contact Finance Advisory. The General Ledger Transaction Listing Report lists all the transactions within income and expense dissections (accounts) and includes the reference, a brief description, and the amount.Custom designed Project Ledger Reports are provided monthly to Principal Investigators.Trust Reports are held in the Trust Ledger (TL) in Finance One. All income and expenditure is held in the one account with the unspent balance being carried forward from one year to the next. These accounts are not permitted to go into a negative.Detailed financial information is also available from Finance One. Report Format:Incomeless Expensesequals Surplus (Deficit)\n3. Report Analysis\nMonthly Financial Reports are produced the 4th and 10th working days of the month and are distributed to Cost Centre managers and Principal Investigators for feedback.When the Reports arrive in the Cost Centre what should happen?After being distributed to the persons responsible, the Cost Centre head should ask for a report back from the Activity Centre as soon as possible giving a brief reason for the variance and the action, if any being taken to correct. The reporting mechanism is important because it reinforces the staff members\u2019 accountability for their budget.What to look for in Reports?All financial performance is measured against the budget (University Policy). However, the budget is a forecast of the future prepared the previous year, and it is inevitable that there will be variances on a line-by-line basis.The key result is the contribution margin result. Cost Centres should match or exceed the budgeted contribution. If a Division is not going to meet the contribution margin, this must be discussed and pre-approved by the Vice-Chancellor.Look for trends. In most cases it is easy to see if any Activity Centre is starting to trend adversely.A common reason for variance is timing differences between actual events and the budget. It is accepted that timing can be difficult to predict. However, it is recommended that departments endeavour to apply some methodology to monthly budget splits rather than adopting the practice of simply dividing the budget total by twelve.Forecasting the year end position is required and Finance Advisory staff will support Cost Centre heads in preparing this.It is strongly recommended that early help is sought if a budget problem is becoming evident. Do not ignore it and hope it will come right. The first contact should be your Finance Advisory staff, who will confirm the analysis of the problem. Should the analysis be confirmed as correct, the departmental or divisional head should be advised so that action can be taken.Errors?Where unexpected transactions appear in the reports, they should be followed up to ensure they are correct and properly authorised. Advice can be sought from the Finance Advisory team.Where errors are found, embedded Finance Advisory staff will assist with correcting journals which will include appropriate and relevant supporting documentation.\n4. Annual Reports\nThe Education and Training Act 2020 (s 305) deems all tertiary institutions to be crown entities in terms of the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA) . Section 43 of the PFA requires that crown entities prepare financial statements. The form of these statements must comply with Generally Accepting Accounting Practice  (GAAP)  which in turn is defined in the Financial Reporting Act 2013. GAAP is defined by reference to approved accounting standards with authoritative support within the New Zealand accounting profession.The University is required to prepare and submit to Parliament an audited Annual Report detailing the operations of the University during the year for each of its outputs as determined by the University Council.The Annual Report includes: Financial statements including a Statement of Financial Performance, Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Accounting Policies.Non-financial statements (called a Statement of Service Performance) reporting on the achievement of the targets per output outlined in the Statement of Objectives approved by the University Council and presented to the Tertiary Education Commission.A report from the Vice-Chancellor."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Fixed_Assets_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Fixed_Assets_Procedure.html", "scope": "Organisational scope not found", "purpose": "These procedures provide a definition of a fixed asset, how fixed assets are to be recorded, their useful life and how they should be disposed of. \nA fixed asset must have a future economic value to the University, be held for more than one year, and have a reliably measured value.The University level for fixed asset capitalisation is set at $2,000.

Classes of fixed assets\nThe University classifies fixed assets into the following categories: Land (dissection 8841)Buildings (dissection 8842, WIP 8843)Computers (dissection 8848)Furniture (dissection 8851)Leasehold Improvements (dissection 8844)Library Books (dissections 8852 & 8857)Motor Vehicles (dissection 8849)Network Infrastructure (dissection 8845)Plant & Equipment (dissection 8846, WIP 8847)Software (dissection 8853, WIP 8854)Rare Books & Special Library Collections (dissection 8855)Artworks (dissection 8856) Ongoing projects should be coded to the applicable fixed asset WIP -additions dissection code.\u00a0\u00a0All amounts relating to a finished fixed asset must be journaled from the WIP dissection code to the corresponding additions dissection code before they are capitalised.More detailed classification is available when recording fixed assets on the central Asset Register.\n3. Purchase of fixed assets\na. Land and Buildings\nThe capital works budget covers land purchases, new buildings (including associated equipment and furniture requirements), building improvements and upkeep and other key IT University projects (e.g. new student management system).The Capital Development Committee is responsible for prioritising the capital works budget allocation. Further information can be obtained from the Project Management Office.\nb. Other Fixed Assets\nFixed assets other than land and buildings may be purchased in accordance with the Financial Delegations Policy.Budget allocations can be transferred from operating expenditure to capital expenditure, but not vice versa, with the authority of the appropriate Divisional Head, subject to the limits in the Schedule of Financial Delegations.Fixed asset purchases may also be funded from Special Departmental Funds, External Research Grants, Otago Research Committee Grants, Trust Funds and capital carry forward credit balances. There is likely to be some conditions attached to the use of these sources of funding and further clarification should be sought from Financial Advisory, Financial Services Division.\nc. Library Books and Periodicals\nThe Information Resources Unit of the Library is responsible for the purchase of library books, standing orders and journals.Library staff select items that support the teaching, learning and research needs of academic programmes and consult with academic departments regarding selections for these purchases.Further information can be obtained from the Associate University Librarian \u2013 Information Resources.\n4. Fixed asset recording and documentation\nFixed assets are recorded on the Asset Register maintained by the Financial Control team, Financial Services Division. This register provides physical description, location, age, depreciation rate, cost, and current book value detail for each asset.Approved purchases of fixed assets must be added to the Asset Register in Finance One on the Create Asset tab within the Finance One Asset Officer Role.\u00a0\u00a0When a purchase order for a new fixed asset is receipted by the Supply Chain, they will complete an asset chart in Finance One (See Appendix I).\u00a0\u00a0This will then be commissioned by the Financial Control team.Fixed asset details recorded include the physical description, division, cost centre, purchase account, depreciation account, value (excluding GST), useful life, location code and asset classification. Data fields are also available for other useful information including manufacturer, model, and serial number.It is recognised that not all fixed assets may be purchased via Unimarket (e.g. some may be purchased via PCards).\u00a0\u00a0Finance Advisory will review the general ledger each month and any uncommissioned transactions will be treated as follows (See Appendix I): Journal the transaction to the correct asset addition dissection codeComplete the New Assets Import Template spreadsheet:New Assets Import Template (XLS) One fixed asset is to be recorded per rowAll costs to get the fixed asset fit for use should be included in the value of the asset e.g. freight, installation, etc.The amount on the spreadsheet must match the amount in the general ledger to the centIf there are several fixed assets purchased on one invoice they must be separated into one fixed asset item per rowForward the completed New Assets Import Template spreadsheet to the Financial Control team Email fsd.assets@otago.ac.nzFurniture additions do not need to be entered into the spreadsheet as these assets are created in bulk by the Financial Control team.The Financial Control team is responsible for reconciling the Asset Register monthly and the commissioning of all fixed assets.All purchases of an asset nature under the value of $2,000 should be charged to a Minor Equipment Account (3216 for other minor equipment) in the relevant activity centre.Items purchased by the Equipment Committee will be coded against the centrally held Equipment Committee budget. However, the fixed asset is attributed to the cost centre for which the fixed asset was purchased and any depreciation on the fixed asset will be charged to that cost centre.Each fixed asset is attributed to a cost centre in the University. The budget manager responsible for the cost centre is also responsible for the physical safeguarding and control of the fixed asset. Any depreciation on the fixed asset is charged to the cost centre.When purchasing motor vehicles please refer to the University Health and Safety Vehicle and Safe Driving Policy.\n5. Depreciation\nAll fixed assets except Land and Special & Rare Library Collections have a limited useful life. The Financial Control team capitalises the fixed asset by including it on the University Balance Sheet and then reduces the value of the fixed asset by charging depreciation to the cost centre.The fixed asset is depreciated to its estimated residual value. University fixed assets are depreciated down to residual values as follows: Fixed asset type Estimated useful life Depreciation rate p.a.Notes\n\n           Buildings and components \n\n        \n\n           10 to 250 years \n\n        \n\n           0.4% to 10% \n\n        \u00a0\n\n           Motor Vehicles \n\n        \n\n           3 to 10 years \n\n        \n\n           10% to 33.3% \n\n        \n\n           see note 1 below \n\n        \n\n           Furniture and Fittings \n\n        \n\n           5 to 10 years \n\n        \n\n           10% to 20% \n\n        \u00a0\n\n           Plant and Equipment \n\n        \n\n           4 to 60 years \n\n        \n\n           1.7% to 25% \n\n        \n\n           see note 2 below \n\n        \n\n           Computers \n\n        \n\n           3 to 10 years \n\n        \n\n           10% to 33.3% \n\n        \u00a0\n\n           Library Collections \n\n        \n\n           5 to 10 years \n\n        \n\n           10% to 20% \n\n        \u00a0Depreciation is calculated monthly and charged to each cost centre in dissections 5111\u20135191.The breakdown of this monthly charge is available in Finance One.\n Note 1: All Motor Vehicles will have a \u201cSalvage Value\u201d entered on the Asset Register as the time of purchase. The Salvage Value will be set at 30 per cent of the purchase price. The vehicle will then be depreciated to this Salvage Value over a 4 year period. In the last year of depreciation the Assistant Accountant \u2013 Assets and Insurance will approach the departmental owner of the vehicle to review the current Salvage Value and the estimated period the department will retain the vehicle \u2013 after this review the Salvage Value and the Remaining Life of the vehicle will be adjusted accordingly and the vehicle depreciated to the new Salvage Value over the new estimated useful life.  Note 2: The default depreciation period for Plant and Equipment is 10 years \u2013 this will be used unless the asset chart is annotated with an item appropriate useful life. \n6. Fixed asset disposal \u2013 Statutory provisions\nEducation and Training Act 2020\nSection 282(4)(a) of the Education and Training Act 2020 states that the power to sell or otherwise dispose of assets or interests in assets shall not be exercised without the written consent of the Secretary. Subsection 5 of Section 282 modifies this by allowing an institution to: 'Sell or otherwise dispose of, or mortgage or otherwise charge, an asset or interest in an asset, where the value of the asset or interest does not exceed an amount determined by the Minister or an amount ascertained in accordance with a formula determined by the Minister'.The following fixed assets cannot be disposed of without first obtaining government approval: Any fixed asset, other than land or buildings, where the market value of the asset being disposed exceeds $50,000 should be referred to Treasury Assets and Insurance Accountant, Financial Services Division.All Land and Building fixed assets should be referred to the Manager of the Property Management Unit, Property Services.Consumer Guarantees Act 1993The Act requires goods to be of an acceptable quality and reasonably fit for any particular purpose. The University may be in breach if any defects are not specifically drawn to the consumer's attention prior to sale.Fair Trading Act 1986Prohibits any person from engaging in \"conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive\".\n7. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 General\nDisposal includes any sale, trade-in, loss, destruction, theft or write-off. The sale or gifting of a fixed asset to another University of Otago department is NOT a Disposal \u2013 see Fixed Asset Transfer procedures below.The Head of Department is responsible for the custody and maintenance of their department's fixed assets. All disposals must be made with the appropriate Senior Leadership Team member's full authority in accordance with the Financial Delegations policy.\u00a0\u00a0Refer to the\u00a0\u00a0 Schedule of Financial Delegations for details of delegation levelsA Fixed Asset Disposal Form must be completed and forwarded to the Financial Control team. Email fsd.assets@otago.ac.nzDownload the Fixed Asset Disposal Form (PDF)The University must receive the maximum value for fixed asset disposals and disposal processes should be fair. GST must be accounted for in fixed asset sales as the University is GST registered.Disposal options include trade-in, transfer to another University department, sale by auction, dismantling and public tender.\u00a0\u00a0 For further advice on the best options for a particular disposal, contact: Email procurement@otago.ac.nz\n8. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 ITS E-Waste and E-Cycle Centre\nElectronic equipment and components should be recycled; refer to ITSE-Waste and E-Cycle Centre.\n9. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Sale of surplus fixed assets to staff\nFixed Assets that are replaced by the University remain the property of the University until such time as they are sold, or disposed of if they have no realisable value.The University will not sell fixed assets to staff or others at a value that is less than can be realised by sale on the open market. If the market value of a fixed asset is not able to be easily assessed, the Chief Financial Officer must be consulted for a value to be agreed.Fixed assets with no realisable value should be disposed of in the most appropriate manner, which may include gifting to staff, but only where an appropriately experienced independent person provides written advice to the University that the fixed asset being disposed of has no realisable value.All sales or gifting of fixed assets to staff require the approval of the Chief Financial Officer. Written advice from the Chief Financial Officer will be provided to the Financial Control team, Financial Services Division attached to the fixed asset disposal form.The Chief Financial Officer shall from time-to-time publish guidance and process advice on the sale of surplus assets to staff. Guidance on sale of surplus assets to staff (PDF)\n10. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Motor vehicles\nSpecial conditions apply to the disposal of motor vehicles. All motor vehicles should be disposed of via auction at Turners. The Treasury Assets and Insurance Accountant should be notified of all intended Motor Vehicle disposals prior to their disposal. Vehicles will not be sold directly to staff, if any staff wish to purchase University vehicles, they can only do so through Turners' auction process.\n11. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Sales receipts\nProceeds from the disposal of a fixed asset must be credited to the University bank account and Cashiers advised. Refer to deposit instructions for guidance. A fixed asset disposal form must be immediately forwarded to the Financial Control team after the disposal. If there are no proceeds from the disposal a fixed asset disposal form must still be completed and forwarded immediately to the Financial Control team.If a fixed asset is traded in, the supplier's invoice must show separately the total cost of the new item and the allowance for the item traded in. A fixed asset disposal form must accompany the supplier invoice before it will be passed for payment.The Financial Control team will reconcile the sale proceeds stated on the disposal form with the department account code to ensure funds have been received and credited appropriately.\n12. Fixed asset disposals \u2013 Accounting treatment\nAll proceeds from the disposal of a fixed asset should be credited to the Department's Proceeds from Sale of Asset account (dissection 5211).The 5211 account is included in the calculation of the department carry forward. Any remaining fixed asset book value on the disposal will be credited (debited) to the Departments Book Value of Assets Sold (dissection 5215). The 5215 account does not impact on the department carry forward. The net effect of the 2 entries is the gain (loss) on sale of the assets for financial reporting purposes.The loss/gain/depreciation recovered on sale will be calculated by the Financial Control team using the fixed asset disposal form.\n13. Transfer of fixed assets between Departments and/or Divisions\nIf a division or department wishes to transfer a fixed asset to another University Division or Department, a fixed asset transfer form must be completed and forwarded to the Financial Control team. Email fsd.assets@otago.ac.nzFixed Asset Transfer Form (PDF) The form must be signed by both the transferee and transferor of the fixed asset (i.e. agreement by both parties)Any deemed transfer price for the fixed asset should be processed via journal entry by the purchasing department as an internal grant.The Financial Control team will prepare the necessary entries to transfer the fixed asset between the departments concerned. The fixed asset cost and accumulated depreciation will transfer to the new cost centre when the fixed asset is transferred in Finance One.\n14. Control of fixed assets\nAn important University internal control objective is the safeguarding of fixed assets. University fixed assets are widely distributed and the responsibility for their safeguarding rests with the Head of Department.All fixed assets should be secure wherever possible. Fixed assets should only be removed from the premises with the permission of the Head of Department and a system for recording the location of such fixed assets should be in place.\n15. Fixed asset audits\nThe Asset Register is one of the key tools in ensuring fixed assets can be accounted for. An audit of the main asset register will be carried out on a regular basis to ensure that the accuracy and completeness of the register is maintained.An annual verification of high value fixed assets in selected classes will be performed.\u00a0\u00a0Items will be selected based on the original cost value. Verification should be actioned by 20 December each year and documented on the appropriate record sheet.An audit will take the form of a cyclical check to ensure that all assets per the register are still in the department, that all new assets have been correctly added to the register, and that other information included in the register is accurate.In order to achieve these checks a Financial Services Division representative will assist the department to conduct the checking on a test basis.\n16. Insurance\nThe University has an extensive insurance programme aimed at minimising the risk of significant loss to the University. The insurance policy has a high level of excess which reduces the premium costs but means that departments incur the first $1,250,000 of every claim (except for motor vehicle claims). Hence insurance does not remove the obligation to manage risk within the departments.The Marine Cargo transport policy covers goods in transit within New Zealand and Australia only. Staff taking assets to other countries, which exceed the covers available on the University Travel Insurance, must arrange additional Marine Cargo transport insurance cover."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Flexible_Working_Request_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Flexible_Working_Request_Procedure.html", "scope": "All University employees.", "purpose": "To outline the procedure for staff wishing to request a flexible working arrangement. \nStaff are able to request flexible working arrangements for personal and/or academic / professional reasons.

Retired staff will be paid an honorarium of $2,000 for panel members and $4,000 for panel convenors, in line with current external academic audit bodies.\nd.\tPanel Members from Outside Tertiary Education\nFor panel members from outside Tertiary Education, including former students, the University of Otago provides an honorarium in line with the current government advisory panels of $342.50 per day for a maximum of five days.\ne.\tReview Secretaries\nThe University of Otago recognises that review secretaries provide an invaluable support to the convenors and other panel members.  Staff who take on this role in addition to other employment within the University are provided with a one-off payment of $750 for each full review they undertake.  Review secretaries are not eligible for time off in lieu or overtime for the work of the review.

However, as the amount of work is less than a full review, the honorarium for retired staff acting as panel members is $250 per GYR and for retired staff acting as convenors is $500 per GYR.  External discipline specialists will be paid an honorarium of $171.25 for each GYR.\n3.\tProcessing and Taxing of Remuneration\nRemuneration of panel members and secretaries is managed and administered by the Quality Advancement Unit.  Like all review expenses, this remuneration is funded by the Divisions (although some exceptions apply).  Payment to convenors and panel members is via the \"Review Panel Member Honorarium Request Form\" and payment to secretaries is via the \"Review Secretary Payment Recommendation Form\".  All reviews remuneration is subject to tax; honoraria are scheduler payments subject to withholding tax and review secretary remuneration is subject to PAYE.

The University operates a wide range of professional business units (e.g. UniPrint, the University Union and Campus Temps) as well as Research Services provided by Research Infrastructure Centre ( RIC ) units.From existing University approved suppliers under contract. These contracts may be established: directly between the University and supplier;through selected contracts with syndicated procurement provisions established by other Crown entities or government departments;through wider public sector arrangements adopted by the University (e.g. All of Government contracts);from pre-qualified supplier panels established by the University or via a professional buying organisation that the University chooses to take out membership with, such as N3 purchasing agreements.through competitive market analysis and associated processes (e.g. tendering/quotes);through selective (including sole source) tender/purchase;via emergency purchase procedures as outlined in clause 8 below.Information on these purchasing options is available from the Procurement Office.\nNote: The University of Otago P-Card is effective and efficient for small value or infrequently purchased items.\nNote: In the normal course of events the University would not expect staff members to be undertaking purchases from their own funds and seeking reimbursement. In the vast majority of cases purchasing should be via a purchase order or p-Card.\n4. Restricted categories for purchase\nThe purchasing process for the sourcing of goods and/or services within the following spend categories have been restricted to the use of the approved specific University processes: IT-related hardware and associated peripheralsComputer softwareMobile phonesTravel and Travel InsuranceAirBnb bookingsPurchase of Research Equipment & ServicesAny purchase that is for Health and Safety Equipment must be secured in line with the University\u2019s Health and Safety policies.\n 5. Purchasing framework\nThe following framework provides advice on purchasing methods and options for given values of goods and services based on the total cost of ownership (including likely additional requirements after initial purchase):  Purchase Value Purchasing Method Purchasing Option\n\n             <$5,000 \n\n          Unimarket Purchase OrderP-CardApproved supplier invoicePetty CashUniversity Contracted SupplierSimple Market analysis\n\n             $5,000 to $100,000 \n\n          Unimarket Purchase OrderP-Card (up to limit defined under P-Card policy)Approved supplier invoiceUniversity Contracted SupplierMinimum of three written quotes (if possible)Formal Tender (if appropriate)\n\n             >$100,000 \n\n          Unimarket Purchase OrderUniversity Contracted SupplierMarket evaluation via formal tender processGoods or services which are available via an existing valid Standing Offer or Contract are able to be purchased in accordance with those agreements without the need for further tendering, regardless of value.Where the selection of the supplier has been made using three quotes or some other method of market analysis, evidence of this analysis should be attached to the resulting purchase order to be retained for audit purposes. Where the supplier selected did not supply the lowest quote, include a brief comment on why that particular supplier was selected such as; ability to meet required delivery timeframe, or overall value for money, etc. The selected quote should be attached to the purchase order sent to the supplier.Any purchase with a value in excess of $5,000 must be endorsed by the Financial Services Division (Finance Advisory) prior to approval by the relevant Purchase Authority (as per the Financial Delegations Policy) prior to purchase.Any purchase with a value between $75,000\u00a0and $100,000\u00a0\u00a0for which only one quote is available, or where a formal tender process is considered inappropriate, must be supported by a\u00a0Procurement Plan or\u00a0\u00a0relevant documentation which provides a justification as to the purchase method requested. This alternative purchase process must be endorsed by the Financial Services Division (Finance Advisory) and approved by the relevant purchasing authority (as per the Financial Delegations Policy) prior to purchase.Purchases greater than $100,000 will require a Procurement Plan to be completed to determine the most appropriate purchasing option unless that purchase is being transacted using an existing valid contract or via an Internal Service Unit.Purchases must not be designed, otherwise structured or divided, at any stage, in order to cause the value to fall below the thresholds listed above to avoid the requirement to competitively market test the purchase or avoid financial endorsement by Finance Advisory.High-value purchases (in excess of NZ$500,000) should be notified to the Financial Services Division\u00a0upon approval of the Purchase Order\u00a0\u00a0(email treasury.accountant@otago.ac.nz) for the purposes of cash flow planning. This advice should include the contracted payments schedule including anticipated invoice payment dates.\n6. Tendering principles\nThe University requires that all procurement of works, goods or services with a value over $100,000 (excl. GST) are subject to a competitive procurement process.Tendering processes are to be used to: establish the competitive prices and terms available;explore or test the market for alternative opportunities;fulfil a public duty of fairness and equity between suppliers;reduce the risk to reputation arising from allegations of purchaser bias or conflicts of interest;confirm current market intelligence; andidentify the best source of goods and services.The content of all tenders received by the University are confidential, and are not to be discussed, or shared under any circumstances with competing suppliers.Anyone involved in a University tender process must meet their obligations under the University\u2019s Conflicts of Interest policy.No commitment, express or implied, should be given to any supplier at any time up until the tender evaluation summary recommendation has been accepted by the relevant purchase authority.The University will use tender processes that allow for transparency of decision-making and subsequent review of the process of decision-making.All University tenders should be coordinated through the University Procurement Office to, at a minimum, obtain a tender number and for publication on the Government Electronic Tender Service (GETS) where necessary. Departments are encouraged to contact the procurement office as soon as practical after identifying that a procurement process is required.Find further information on the University Tender Process\n7. Tendering methods\nOpen tenders should be advertised in a manner so as to attract a wide response. At a minimum, such tenders should be listed via the Government Electronic Tendering Service website.Selective (including sole source) purchase or tender of any goods and services may be appropriate where: It is an emergency purchase (see section 9 below);The goods or services require specialised skills or are very complex, and there are limited qualified suppliers;The required goods and services are only available from one source, or limited sources, in the relevant timeframe;The standardisation or compatibility requirements require the use of a specific supplier;The goods or services are substantively identical to those purchased within the last twelve months under an open tender process; careful consideration should be given to changes in market conditions and the entitlement of other tenderers to compete on more favourable terms; and,Purchasing Officers should ensure that the element of competition is maintained by requesting that the selected tenderer submit a firm quotation on each occasion this dispensation is used with no indication that the selected tenderer is the only bidder.The goods or services are subject to prototype or development work. In this case, the following factors should be considered when selecting the vendor and negotiating any subsequent contract: the technical and commercial experience of the prospective vendor;the ownership of the finished product, protection of intellectual property, possible patent rights and ownership of any moulds and dies;the basis of payment including method of calculating charges, progress payments and final payments;ownership of pre-production samples; and,rights to commercial development of the product.The cost of a procurement process is likely to be disproportionate to the value or benefits likely to be gained; orThe goods or services can be obtained via a syndicated procurement or contract privity opportunity clause that provides a commercial benefit to the University and avoids any further cost of procurement.Each decision to purchase via selective tender for goods/services in excess of $100,000 must be supported by an approved procurement plan. The decision to proceed with selective tendering rests with the Delegated Purchase Authority. This documentation should be attached to the Unimarket requisition for future reference and audit purposes. A selective tender cannot be used to: Avoid competition;Protect domestic suppliers;Discriminate against any domestic or international supplier.\n8. Establishment of contracts\nThe establishment of standing offers and contracts (either established by the University or as part of a syndicated procurement opportunity) should be the result of a formal tender process (either an open tender or a selective/sole source tender).Contracts are to be executed in the name of the University of Otago and where possible, the University Contracts Templates should be used in the first instance. All standing offer contracts or agreements are undertaken on behalf of the University and will be available for use by any University of Otago department.The financial delegation\u2019s policy and procedures along with the delegations schedule classifies the categories of contracts and who has delegated authority to approve them. Contracts can only be approved by officers authorised to do by the Financial Delegations Procedure.All contracts must be registered within the respective Department\u2019s legal library within OurDrive. Contracts executed for the purchase of goods and services must be advised to the University Procurement Office who will allocate a contract number, where none exists, and, if required, provide advice to users on how to record the contract in the Ourdrive Contract Register Tool for contract recording and administration purposes.\n9. Emergency purchases\nIn case of an emergency, normal purchasing rules may be set aside for specific goods and services where: the goods and/or services are required to complete or continue significant tasksit is impossible to purchase goods and services under normal purchasing procedures.Emergency purchasing is to be used solely to meet immediate emergency\u00a0or genuine unforseen\u00a0\u00a0requirements,\u00a0\u00a0and must never be used solely for expediency. Authorising officers are to ensure that emergency purchases are strictly controlled.Approval of Emergency Purchases is to be made in accordance with the University\u2019s Financial Delegations Policy/Procedures. Where the value of an emergency purchase is in excess of $75,000, the respective Pro Vice Chancellor ( PVC ) or Service Division Head must approve that the purchase meets the Emergency Purchase threshold prior to committing expenditure.\n10. Overseas purchases\nPurchases are normally only to be made from overseas when price (including delivery and associated costs) and quality are competitive and goods are unavailable in New Zealand,\u00a0which is aligned with the New Zealand Governments\u2019 broader outcomes.For purchases requiring foreign currency, please refer to the Treasury Management Policy for notification procedures and arrangements for forward cover.\n11. Probity/conflicts of interest\nAnyone involved in a University purchase process must meet their obligations under the University\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Policy. A conflict of interest can be: Actual: where the conflict already existsPotential: where the conflict is about to happen, or could happenPerceived: where other people might reasonably think that a person has been compromised.University staff and contractors must comply with the following principles of probity (ethical conduct) throughout all stages of the procurement and contracting process: use of a competitive process where possible;transparency;identification and resolution of conflicts of interest;fairness and impartiality;security and confidentiality.All conflicts of interest shall be managed in line with the University\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Policy and recorded in the University Conflicts of Interest Register.\n12. Use of third party (agents or brokers)\nThere is no restriction on the use of agents or brokers. When considering their use, issues associated with total costs of ownership, effectiveness and efficiency, and leverage should be analysed so that the value added by agents or brokers is clearly articulated and understood. The use of an agent or broker does not negate the need for compliance\u00a0\u00a0with the University Procurement Policy and/or procedures; both in terms of how the Agent or Broker was initially selected and their subsequent purchasing activity on behalf of the University.\n13. Trade ins, free goods and trial items\nAs part of the negotiations for a purchase of replacement goods or equipment an existing item of equipment may be offered as a trade-in.A trade-in is considered to be an asset disposal for the purposes of S282 and S283 of the Education and Training Act 2020. All disposals with a book value greater than an \u201camount determined by the Minister of Education\u201d (and advised annually by FSD to Cost Centre Heads) requires the written consent of the Secretary of Education before disposal. Any further queries on this subject area should be directed to the Financial Accountant, FSD .Trade-ins should be explicitly dealt with in the contract's terms and conditions, including the value of the trade-in credited by the seller against the value of the new equipment. Full details of the sale of the old asset and the true cost of the new asset must be obtained for updating the Asset Register.Trials, free goods and trade-ins all provide opportunities for goods and services to pass between entities or individuals without fully recording the transaction. Wherever possible a price discount should be sought in preference to a 'free' item. If the good being supplied \u2018free\u2019 is an asset, where title as passed to the University, it should be advised to the University Assets and Insurance Accountant\u00a0\u00a0for registration in the University Asset register.Any \u2018Trade in\u2019 of existing University Assets needs to be advised to FSD Assets and Insurance Accountant to ensure that the asset is correctly disposed of within the University Asset Register.Goods provided for trial, where the asset \u2018risk\u2019 passes to the University, must be notified to the University Insurance Officer so that the appropriate insurance coverage can be arranged."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Purchase_Card_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Purchase_Card_Procedure.html", "scope": "This procedure applies to the University and its subsidiaries.", "purpose": "The purpose of this procedure is to define the rules and procedures governing the use of Purchase Cards. \nPurchase Cards are available to staff who have a genuine need for one.

Issue of Purchase Cards\nPurchase Cards are available to staff who have a genuine need for one. To be eligible for a Purchase Card, an employee must be a University of Otago staff member and meet at least one of the following criteria: Travel frequently in the course of their dutiesTravel overseas in the course of their dutiesPurchase single, non-recurring purchases from a supplier not already within UnimarketIncur regular expenses of a kind appropriately paid for by a Purchase CardPurchase small value or infrequently purchased itemA Purchase Card should not be used where the University has established specific procurement arrangements for certain goods and services with preferred or mandatory suppliers that do not anticipate the use of Purchase Cards.

Distribution of Purchase Cards\nThe issuing bank will forward the Purchase Card directly to the Accounts Payable team. The Pcard Administrator will contact the applicant who will be required to collect the card in person (photo ID is required).The applicant will also receive an email with all relevant links to the Policy and Procedures, including the Purchase Card User Guide. If the applicant is located outside of Dunedin, the purchase card will be couriered.The Purchase Card can be used from the commencement date printed on the face of the card. The cardholder must visit an ANZ bank branch to add a PIN (4 digit number) to the Purchase Card, photo identification will be required. The PIN selected should be unique to this Purchase Card i.e. should not be the same number as other cards and\u00a0\u00a0should be kept confidential to the cardholder. PIN numbers should never be disclosed to anyone or written down.\n3. Purchase Card limits\nEach Purchase Card will be issued with a monthly credit limit of either $2,500, $5,000 or $10,000. If a different limit under $10,000 is required, this will be approved by the Pcard Administrator on a case-by-case basis.If a credit limit higher than $10,000 is required, approval resides with the Chief Financial Officer. All requests should clearly state the reasons for the higher limit.Credit limits will be reviewed on a regular basis, and where a Purchase Card is being operated well below the assigned limit, that limit may be reduced at the discretion of the Purchase Card Administrator with agreement by the cardholder's HOD or Manager.Temporary limit increases may be applied for as and when required by emailing the Pcard Administrator with authoriser's approval, the value of increase and the length of time required.\n4. Use of the Purchase Card\nThe Purchase Card can be used at any location displaying the Visa brand.The Purchase Card must only be used by the individual staff member to whom it is issued. Under no circumstances should the details of a Purchase Card be shared with another person or the Purchase Card be used by another person on the holder's behalf as per Visa policy.Purchase Cards should not be used as departmental cards by several members of staff.Expenditure charged to Purchase Cards must be business-related. It must be reasonable, appropriate and in accordance with the University's policies and procedures related to expenditure. In particular, cardholders should be familiar with the Travel and Travel Related Costs Policy.Where expenditure is incurred on behalf of a number of cardholders, and one of the cardholders is the supervisor of the other cardholders, then the expenditure must be charged to the Purchase Card of the supervisor (the \u2018one-up\u2019 principle).A Purchase Card may be used to make purchases over the phone or internet. To reflect good security practices, such purchases should only be from established reputable companies known to the University. Purchase Card details should only be entered on an identified secure web site.Note: Staff should be cautious and refrain, where possible, from purchasing from global online retailers for equipment and goods on the basis that there is very little support available when there is an issue with either the purchase or when the product is in use (non-delivery, incorrect item, warranty issue, product quality, etc).Goods purchased online or by phone using a PCard should always be delivered to a University address unless prior approval from a HOD has been obtained. Approval (e.g. email) should be attached to the transaction in Finance One along with the appropriate invoice/receipt.A Purchase Card should not be used where the University has established specific procurement arrangements for certain goods and services with preferred or mandatory suppliers that do not anticipate the use of Purchase Cards. Examples of this include the purchase of stationery via UniMarket and the purchase of air travel which should be made via the University's mandatory travel agents, and the subscription to mobile phone accounts which should be made through the University\u2019s agreement with One NZ .When travelling to China staff will need to link their Pcard to a Mobile Payment platform App. Please contact the Pcard Administrator who will provide you with the most current App to use. On return to New Zealand, the Pcard must be un-linked from the App.\n5. Disputed transactions\nDisputed transactions must be resolved with either the supplier or the issuing bank by the cardholder. If the issuing bank suspects a fraudulent transaction, they will contact the cardholder via text or email/phone the Pcard administrator to investigate with the cardholder.If the cardholder is unable to contact the supplier, they must complete the ANZ Disputes Form and contact the Pcard Administrator so that the bank can be advised immediately that the transaction is being disputed. ANZ Disputes Form (PDF)The transaction must be coded as \u201cin dispute\u201d in the Finance One PCard module, and remain so until the issue has been resolved.\n6. Cash advances\nPurchase Cards will only be issued with a cash advance facility if the cardholder has indicated the intention to travel overseas, although such a facility may be provided to other cardholders on request to the Pcard Administrator. Each request should contain a full explanation of the reason for needing to access cash advances.Where a cash advance facility is provided, the use of the facility must comply with the following:\nDrawing cash within New Zealand is not permitted unless the cardholder is away from their home campus at the time the cash is required.Approved koha for UOW or UOC may be withdrawn using Pcard, with approval from the Office of M\u0101ori Development provided as supporting documentation for the transaction.Approved Pacific Gifting for UOW or UOC may be withdrawn using Pcard, with approval from Divisional Pacific Leaders and/or the Pacific Development Office provided as supporting documentation for the transaction.Prior to withdrawing cash, the cardholder should exhaust all other options of payment including using the standard Purchase Card functionality.Cash withdrawn must be accounted for in the same manner as all other expenditure, including the attachment of appropriate supporting documentation.Unspent cash should be converted back to NZ currency, banked into the University bank account, and coded to the Finance One ledger account used for the original cash withdrawal. Evidence of this deposit should be included with the Purchase Card monthly statement.In the event that unspent cash cannot be converted back to NZ currency, such as coins or an uneconomic amount, then the cash should be returned to the Cashiers team, Financial Services Division.\n7. Expenditure documentation\nConsistent with any purchase on behalf of the University, expenditure must be supported by appropriate documentation. Tax invoices must be supplied for NZ expenditure in excess of $50.00. Appropriate invoices and/or receipts must be supplied for all foreign purchases. Invoices and/or receipts must be legible and itemised.A lost receipt form must be completed for all missing receipts over $50 detailing each item of expenditure.The requirements of a valid tax invoice issued by a New Zealand organisation can be found under the heading \u201cUniversity Expenditure \u2013 Claiming GST From Invoices Received\u201d within the University of Otago Taxation Guidance.\n8. Coding of Purchase Card Transactions\nPurchase Card transactions will be loaded into the Finance One Pcard Module on a regular basis using an import file provided by the bank.The principal coder for that card will receive a reminder email alerting them to the fact that there are outstanding transactions to be coded.It is the cardholder\u2019s or designated administrator\u2019s responsibility to monitor and appropriately code all Purchase Card transactions. Coding needs to be completed by noon on the first working day of each month following the transaction date. If the purchase card holder is traveling for longer than 30 days at a time, an exception may be granted to allow additional time to complete this task. If an exception is given, the cardholder will receive an email from the Pcard Administrator confirming the revised due date.Coding of Purchase Card transactions is actioned within the Finance One OU My PCard Module. The process includes identifying any applicable New Zealand GST, inclusion of suitable comments supporting each transaction and a summarised narration for finance reports.Note that both the supporting comments and ledger narrations will appear on the monthly Purchase Card statement. It is important that they include sufficient detail to substantiate each transaction.Further information relating to this process can be found in the Purchase Card User Guide.\n9. Monthly Purchase Card statements\nOn the first business day of each month, cardholders will be emailed a statement showing the previous month\u2019s Purchase Card transactions. This statement should be reviewed and signed by the cardholder, declaring that \u201cthe information contained on this form is correct and the expenses incurred were for business purposes in accordance with the University of Otago Purchase Card Policy\u201d. Under no circumstances should a Purchase Card statement be signed on behalf of the cardholder \u2013 only the cardholder can make the above declaration.The Purchase Card Statement must be authorised by the cardholder\u2019s supervisor. The supervisor must record their name and position on the statement. In all cases, this review and authorisation should be performed by a person senior to the cardholder. This is known as the \u201cOne-up\u201d principle and should always be applied.If a Purchase Card Statement contains expenditure relating to the supervisor, then it should be referred to a higher authority for approval.The signed and approved Purchase Card Statement, along with all original supporting documentation must be forwarded to pcard.admin@otago.ac.nz by the date specified on the statement. If possible, each invoice/receipt should be scanned and attached to the appropriate transaction row within Finance One.\n10. Lost or stolen cards\nPurchase Cards are valuable and should be treated in the same way as a passport or cash.If a Purchase Card is lost or stolen during working hours, the cardholder must contact ANZ and the Pcard Administrator immediately. The administrator will arrange for the Purchase Card to be cancelled and a replacement issued.\u00a0\u00a0If the Purchase Card is lost of stolen outside normal working hours, the cardholder must contact ANZ bank immediately to arrange for the card to be cancelled and then contact the Pcard Administrator to advise the loss and initiate arrangements for a replacement card.ANZ Bank Contact details are: In New Zealand call 0800 888 111 From overseas call collect +64 9 914 8026 The ANZ bank is liable for all charges incurred on the account once they have been advised of the lost card.In the event the lost Purchase Card is subsequently found by the cardholder, it should be destroyed as it will no longer be valid as a replacement card has been issued.\n11. Audit\nAn audit of Purchase Card transactions will be performed on a regular basis by the Office of Risk, Assurance and Compliance and may be sample selected annually by external auditors as part of the annual accounts audit process.If a cardholder is suspected of misusing their Purchase Card, the details will be reported to the cardholder\u2019s HOD, the Chief Financial Officer, and the Financial Controller for comment and/or resolution.\n12. Misuse of Purchase Card\nMisuse of a Purchase Card could include, but is not limited to: Inappropriate expenditurePersonal expenditureInappropriate or inadequate supporting documentationInappropriate use of a cash advance facilityUse of a Purchase Card by someone other than the cardholderFailure to provide a correctly authorised monthly statementFailure to comply with any other University policy or procedure related to the use of Purchase CardsMisuse of the Purchase Card by the cardholder will lead to: Cancellation of the Purchase CardA request for immediate reimbursement of the inappropriate expenditure if repayment has not been made per Clause 5 of the Purchase Card PolicyPossible disciplinary actionIntentional misuse of a Purchase Card for personal gain is fraudulent behaviour under the University's Fraud Policy and will be referred to the relevant authorities for the purposes of investigation and possible prosecution.\n13. Cessation of employment\nIf a cardholder leaves the employment of the University (or its subsidiaries), or no longer holds a role where a Purchase Card is required, it is their responsibility to: Reconcile all Purchase Card expenditure since the last statement and provide the necessary supporting documentation for this expenditure.Advise the Pcard Administrator so the Purchase Card can be cancelled. In the event a cardholder is not able to do so, the responsibility lies with their supervisor.Return the Purchase Card to their immediate supervisor or the Pcard Administrator.\n14. Review of continued use\nA monthly review of the Purchase Cards on issue will be performed by Accounts Payable personnel. The results of the review, together with recommendations, will be presented to the Chief Financial Officer.Purchase Cards which have not been used for a period of six months will be subject to cancelation.If the signed and approved Purchase Card Statement and supporting documentation are not received within the policy timelines, the Purchase Card may be suspended.In all cases the cardholder must account for all outstanding expenditure incurred prior to the Purchase Card being cancelled."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Remote_Access_Procedure_including_VPN", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Remote_Access_Procedure_including_VPN.html", "scope": "This Procedure applies University-wide.", "purpose": "This procedure must be followed to ensure the integrity of the University's network and to protect all users of University systems. \nThe University VPN service is managed and operated by ITS as part of the overall University network infrastructure.Access to the University VPN service shall be via authenticated login utilising the University Authentication System.Access shall only be granted for approved users.Users of the University VPN service are bound by the University Information and Communications Technology Regulations 2014 and Policies.

This procedure describes how to:", "content": "Interim or final reporting\nFunders often require a financial report and those providing funding in a foreign currency require the report to be completed in the funding currency. Reports may be completed at specified dates during the life of the project and/or at its conclusion. Reporting requirements are described in the project contract.\nWhen completing financial reports in a foreign currency, identify the foreign currency amount(s) received in the reporting period from the finance system. Expenses shown on the project statement for the reporting period are converted to the funding currency using the budgeted rate shown on the CCW.\nConcluding the project\nCalculate Exchange Gain or Loss on Funding.\nThe University assumes foreign exchange risk when it enters into a contract that stipulates it will be paid in foreign currency. The risk arises from movements in the exchange rate. The CCW for the project will assume a fixed rate of exchange when the project budget and funding application is completed. The University will receive either more or less funding when measured in New Zealand dollars if the exchange rate is different from planned when the funding is received. Since the funding is fixed in the foreign amount, the University does not have recourse to be reimbursed for any loss. Exchange gains are also retained by the University on the same basis.\nBefore beginning\n\nEnsure the project balance is final\nDetermine if the funder is entitled to any surplus with reference to the contract\nConsult the signed CCW to confirm the budgeted exchange rate\nRun a project life-to-date report from the reports menu in Finance One\n\nStep 1: Calculate the Exchange Gain or Loss on Funding \u2013 this amount is the University's\n\nIdentify the foreign amounts received using the enquiry function in Finance One for each year the project was running also noting the NZD equivalent. If the total of the NZD equivalent matches the life-to-date report, then all the foreign amounts have been identified\nConvert the total of the foreign amount received to NZD using the budgeted exchange rate from the CCW\n\nIf the NZD amount shown on the life-to-date report is larger than the amount calculated, the University has earned an exchange gain.  Conversely, if the amount calculated is more than the amount shown on the life-to-date report, the University has suffered an exchange loss\n\nStep 2:  Determine the Project Over or Under Spend\n\nUsing the life-to-date report, determine whether the amount spent in NZD is larger or smaller than the budgeted amount\nNothing is refundable if the amount spent is larger than the amount budgeted in NZD. This difference is a project overspend (i.e. deficit) for which the Cost Centre is responsible\nA project under spend has occurred if the amount spent in NZD is smaller than the budgeted amount in NZD. This amount is either refundable to the funder or may be retained by the Cost Centre as described in the project contract\n\nStep 3:  Complete the Project Closing Form\nThe exchange gain or loss on funding is charged to the Department using dissection code 7516 in the project and crediting 7116 in the Department.  Losses are closed crediting dissection 3281 in the project and debiting it in the Department.  Indicate the account code and amount of the gain or loss on the project closing form.\nIf the project under spend is to be refunded, follow the Credit Note procedure.  A credit note is entered against the last invoice recorded in the Accounts Receivable system.  Dissection 1321 is generally used.\nAny project under spend that is retained is entered on the project closing form along with the account code to receive it.  The same holds true for any amount overspent.\nCompleted project closing forms are forwarded to the Research and Enterprise Office who in turn provide a copy to the Financial Services Division.  The Financial Services Division will enter the amounts shown on the closing form to the account codes specified.\nResponsibilities\nThe calculation of the exchange gain or loss and the project under or over spend is part of the project management responsibility undertaken in the Cost Centre.\nThe credit note is usually prepared by the Research Office.  The supporting calculation is sent from the Cost Centre to the Research Office, if that office is completing the credit note, to attach to the transaction.  The Department attaches the calculation to the credit note transactions if it prepares the credit note.\nUse the worksheet at the end of this procedure to calculate the exchange gain or loss and the over or under spend on the project.  Double click anywhere on the worksheet to open Excel and complete the shaded boxes.  Print the worksheet to attach to the closing form or to scan it to be attached to the credit note.\nExamples\nExample 1 \u2013 An exchange gain and a project under spend\nAssume a project has received an award for USD $100k and the budgeted exchange rate is $0.83 (one NZD buys USD 0.83) producing budgeted revenue of $120k in NZD. Over the life of the project the funding received when measured in NZD was $125k. Lastly, assume that the amount spent was $115k.\nThe exchange gain on the funding was $5k and this amount always belongs to the University.  The amount is determined by comparing the amount budgeted to be received ($120k) to the amount actually received ($125k).\n\n\nExchange Rate per CCW\n\n0.83\n\n\nAmount funded in foreign currency\n100,000\n\n\nBudgeted funded in NZD\n\n120,000\n\n\nActual funding in NZD\n\n125,000\n\n\nCurrency gain or (loss)\n5,000\n\n\nThe amount to be returned to the funder at the end of the project is NZD $5k which is the budgeted spend of $120k in New Zealand dollars less the actual spend of $115k in New Zealand dollars.  A credit note is processed for $5,000.  Please refer to the Projects Account Refund Procedure for instructions on creating a credit note in a foreign currency.\n\n\nBudgeted Expenditure\n120,000\n\n\nActual Expenditure\n115,000\n\n\nRefundable (non-refundable)\n5,000\n\n\nExample 2 - An exchange loss and a project over spend\nAssume the same facts as in Example 1 except that over the life of the project the NZD equivalent of the funding received was $117k and the expenses incurred were $123k.\nThe exchange loss on the funding was $3k determined as the amount received of $117k less the budgeted amount to be received of $120k.\n\n\nExchange Rate per CCW\n\n0.83\n\n\nAmount funded in foreign currency\n100,000\n\n\nBudgeted funding in NZD\n\n120,000\n\n\nActual funding in NZD\n\n117,000\n\n\nCurrency gain or (loss)\n-3,000\n\n\nThe project over spend is the amount that was budgeted of $120k less the $123k that was spent.\n\n\nBudgeted Expenditure\n120,000\n\n\nActual Expenditure\n123,000\n\n\nRefundable (non refundable)\n-3,000\n\n"}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Research_Account_Refunds_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Research_Account_Refunds_Procedure.html", "scope": "This procedure applies to all University of Otago staff involved in the administration of externally funded research contracts, where there is an obligation to return surplus funds to the funder.

This balance may have arisen because the amount funded was different from the amount budgeted; the amount spent was different from the amount budgeted; or a combination of the two.  When a project concludes with a surplus, that is the amount spent is less than the amount funded, the surplus may have to be returned to the funder.  The project contract should be consulted to determine whether the funder or the University owns the surplus or if the right to retain the surplus must be negotiated with the funder.\nDebtor Accounts\nAll funders should have a Debtors Account created at the time the contract for service is signed.  Invoices are issued using the Finance One system for all amounts receivable under the terms of the contract.\nFollow the steps below once it has been confirmed that the project surplus is to be refunded.\nStep 1: Ensure that the project balance is final\n\nIf the project was funded in foreign currency refer to the procedure Reporting on Foreign Funded Research Projects\nAll funding has been invoiced and received\nAll supplier invoices have been recorded or amounts accrued\nAnnual leave has been accounted for\nService divisions have been notified that the project is closed\nThere are no commitments listed on the project's financial reports\nIf the project is currently active, ask DMU to inactivate the project\n\nStep 2: Determine the refundable amount\n\nRun the project life-to-date report from the reports menu in Finance One\nIdentify the amount in the Operating Surplus (Deficit) line and the Act+Comm column of the report.  If the amount is without brackets, the project has finished with a surplus and is the amount to be returned to the funder unless a different lower amount has been negotiated\n\nStep 3: Creation of the credit note\nCredit notes are used to cancel invoices either in whole or part.  A credit note for the refund is to be linked with the last invoice issued.\n\nRefer to the Finance One Accounts Receivable Manual for instructions on how to create a credit note\nCreate the credit note and attach any supporting documentation that explains why a credit is being entered to the funder's account. The documentation may include making use of the Notes feature to type a full and complete description of the refund     Use the attachment feature to include any important documents, calculations or emails relating to the refund.     Credit notes must contain sufficient documentation to allow the reviewer in Financial Services to understand both the amount and reason for the refund.\n\nStep 4: Notify the Revenue Management Office\nAdvise Financial Services Division, Revenue Management Office (RMO) that the credit needs to be repaid to the funder.  The RMO will complete an AR Adjustment which transfers the Debtor Account credit to the clearing account 10.BS.C05.8206.00.\nFinancial Services Division Accounts Payable staff will scan an invoice form prepared by the RMO staff to relieve the clearing account and create a balance to be paid on either the Debtor's Creditor Account or a Sundry Creditor Account.\nThe balance is paid out in the next Creditors payment run."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Research_Project_Closing_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Research_Project_Closing_Procedure.html", "scope": "Organisational scope not found", "purpose": "This procedure describes the steps followed once a research project has been completed. \n\nObligations described in the contract have been met\nService divisions are advised to discontinue any charges to the project\nThe financial result is final\n", "content": "Cost Centres are responsible for ensuring:\n\nObligations described in the contract have been met\nService divisions are advised to discontinue any charges to the project\nThe financial result is final\n\n\nAll funding has been received\n\nFinal invoices from suppliers have been received and processed\nAny general ledger entries to account for payroll related accruals have been completed\nCost transfers have been accounted for, if any\n\n\nA Project Closing Form is completed by the Cost Centre and forwarded to the Research and Enterprise Office.

The debtor account is used to make credit sales by raising an invoice against the account.  Existing accounts with a nil balance that have not had any activity for 18 months and no signed Debtor Account Application form is on file are made inactive.  The Accounts Receivable \u2013 Account Application \u2013 Research Funder form is used to request an account be reactivated.  The form is also used to have new debtors set up in the financial system.\nInvoicing\nAll revenue transactions are recorded in the University's financial system, Finance One, using an appropriate invoice format.  No off system invoices or emails should be made to customers to communicate amounts due or adjustments to amounts due.  Communication of amounts to be paid is always made via an invoice issued from Finance One.  The Accounts Receivable Procedure states that an \u201c\u2026invoice is required in all circumstances where a cash sale is not made.\u201d\nSome funders make regular electronic payments to the University.  These receipts also require an invoice.  This ensures that all revenue is properly documented and facilitates any future necessary account adjustments.  In these cases, an invoice would be generated against which payments are applied, but the invoice would not be sent to the customer.\nInvoices can only be sent to Funders once they have been reviewed and posted to the Finance One ledger by the Revenue Management Office. This is to ensure that any issues with the invoice can be resolved prior to the Funder receiving the invoice.\nCredit notes\nCredit notes are used to cancel invoices either in whole or in part and are used to:\n\nCorrect errors in the original invoice\nAccount for the return of unspent funds\nAmend the debtor account for a price dispute\n\nBecause GST is paid by the University to the IRD as soon as a GST invoice is issued it is important that any credit notes be issued promptly.\nCredit notes should not be sent to customers prior to posting for those reasons described in the invoicing section above.\nSee the Finance One Accounts Receivable Manual for information on how to create a credit note.\nRevenue Management Office, Financial Services Division\nMaintenance of debtor accounts\nThe Revenue Management Office is responsible for the maintenance of the debtors account list.

Prior to this it is considered by the Senior Leadership Team and approved by the Finance and Budget Committee. The budget preparation is an important process. Heads of Departments and Cost Centre heads advise the Divisional head of the resources required to produce the agreed level of outputs or service. This should be done in the standard budget submission document for service divisions. Academic Department Heads should take advice from the Divisional Office.\nBudget Pack\nA Budget Pack is prepared by the Budget Accountant and distributed annually. This pack contains the budget submission template for Service Divisions.\nThe following information is included for Academic Divisions:\n\n\nEFTS by paper\nIncome summary\n\nPBRF information\nCost driver information\nFunding model by cost centre\nFunding model summary\n\nThe following charges, previously distributed in budget packs and salary templates, are loaded into the budget module in Finance One:\n\nBase salary data and salary related costs\nInsurance\nITS charges\nInternal charges (rent, energy, cleaning and car parking)\nTrust information\nDepreciation\n\nTraining\nThe Financial Services Division Training Programme includes training on the budget module which is timed to coincide with service division and academic division budget preparation.\nBudget guidelines\nGuidelines are prepared annually and are available on the introduction page in each budget pack within the budget module. The guidelines should be read prior to commencing the preparation of the budget.\nBudget advice\nAdditional advice or assistance is available from the Division's Financial Analyst.\nBudget review\nThe budget review takes place from April to June each year after enrolment and course changes are known. The Funding Model is recalculated to take into account the updated EFTS information.\nThe budget review is also used to correct any major errors and allow for any major changes in objectives and outputs. The approval process for the budget review is similar to that for that original budget.\nFunding model overview\nThe purpose of the funding model is to allocate resources to the four Academic Divisions of the University.\nThe first step is the estimation of the income, for each Division, from the Government grant and student fees based on the forecast EFTS for the budget year.\nThe next step is the calculation of deductions from the income for the following items:\n\nCapital Component \u2013 a fixed amount per EFTS and is used to partially fund capital expenditure\nInternational Student Levy \u2013 an amount deducted for each international student providing central funding\nService Divisions \u2013 deductions are made for service Division budgets\nCentral Committees and contestable funds \u2013 deductions are made for each of the contestable Committee budget and contestable funds for special purposes\nFiscal Strategy Adjustment \u2013 A deduction may be made to meet the fiscal objectives set by University Council.\n\nService Division allocations\nThe main function of the Service Divisions is to provide ancillary and support services to the Academic Divisions. Service Divisions are required to prepare zero based budgets for ongoing activity. These budgets are scrutinised by the Special Budget Committee to ensure that the ongoing budgets are reasonable for the level of service performance required.\nThe Non Academic New Initiatives fund is a contestable fund which is available for new initiatives put forward by the Service Divisions and Central Committees. The Vice-Chancellor invites bids for allocations from this fund.\nSeveral departments within the Service Divisions are required to recover costs by directly charging for the services provided. These units are described as \"Business Units\" and the process is called \u201cFull Cost Recovery\u201d. Business Units are required to budget for break-even (income less expenditure equals zero). Expenditure includes depreciation but excludes capital expenditure. The Business Units include Property Management Unit, Information Technology Services, and Uniprint.\nCentral Committees and contestable funds\nThe Central Committees funded through the Funding Model are the Research Committee, Internationalisation Committee, Committee for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching (CALT), Risk Management Committee, Animal Welfare Committee and the Scholarships Committee. These Committees submit budget submissions based on forecasted need. A funding allocation is made after considering the strategic importance of outputs. The Research Committee allocates budgets to staff members for research projects based on the merit of proposals and to further the objectives set out in the University Research Plan.\nThe Internationalisation Committee promotes the achievement of the goals and objectives of the Internationalisation Management Plan and provides international scholarships and financial support for student exchange.\nThe Scholarships Committee provides funding for many of the University's awards and scholarships to promote excellence.\nThe Committee for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching promotes excellence in teaching, learning and assessment. The Committee supports innovative developments, internationalisation of programmes and curricula, and fosters and facilitates research into teaching.\nSeveral contestable funds also exist to allocate funds for proposals that help achieve the University's objectives and outputs and where funding is not available elsewhere. The current funds are the Academic Development Fund supporting new academic initiatives and the Teaching Development Fund encouraging the development of new teaching methods. Interested Departments or staff members should contact the Divisional office in the first instance."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Revenue_Receipting_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Revenue_Receipting_Procedure.html", "scope": "Organisational scope not found", "purpose": "Teaching and Research outputs create the majority of income with the remainder coming from various sources including departmental activities, student accommodation, investments and trading activities. \n\nany sales are for cash, not credit\nany invoices issued are processed promptly and paid on time\nbanking of cash is performed regularly\n", "content": "\nSources of income\nGovernment Grant\nThe Government Grant is based on the expected number of EFTS enrolments at the University. The EFTS information system is used to provide all returns to the Ministry of Education. Departments are required to provide forecasts and confirm their enrolments at various times during the year. EFTS calculations and returns are managed by the Planning Support and Funding Office.\n\n Student tuition fees\nCourse fees are set by the University Council after careful consideration of the forecast Government Grant and the quality of the courses to be offered. Revenue Management Office (Financial Services Division) administer the invoicing and collection of the fees. For more information on student fees, contact the Revenue Management Office.\n\n Research grants\nExternal research grants are sourced from numerous national and several international bodies. The Research and Enterprise Office co-ordinates University applications for research grants. Research funding is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 18. Any queries relating to applications and administration of research grants should be made to the Research and Enterprise Office, phone extension 8413.\n\n Departmental income\nThe sources of the income are varied, for example:\n\nThe School of Dentistry charges for services provided to the public in training dentistry students.\nGoods and services provided to other departments result in internal charges which are reflected as departmental income in the charging departments accounts.\nWork is performed by department staff for external parties and a charge is made.\nA commercial activity generates departmental income.\n\nHalls and flats\nThe University provides accommodation for students studying at the University. This activity is self funding in that the charges made are designed to cover the full costs of providing the accommodation.\nThe activities relating to accommodation are contained in the A section of the ledger. The Director of Accommodation Services is responsible for this activity.\n\n Investment income\nCash, surplus to monthly requirements, is invested in accordance with University Investment Guidelines and the Public Finance Act. A comprehensive cash management function is performed by the Treasury Accountant in conjunction with the Revenue Management Office to ensure that the optimum return is achieved from day-to-day cash management. The level of income derived is very dependent on interest rates and the cash flow patterns in the University.\nThe management of departmental cash flow can have a significant influence on this income by ensuring:\n\nany sales are for cash, not credit\nany invoices issued are processed promptly and paid on time\nbanking of cash is performed regularly\n\n\n Trust income\nThe University is the beneficiary of many donations each year. Many of these donations are held by the University in Trust. Further information is available in the Trust Funds Procedures.\n\n\nDepartmental banking\nIntroduction\nCash and cheques are received by University Departments as part of the day-to-day management of the department. The receipts may result from cash sales or the payment of invoices issued previously by departments. This section describes the procedures for collecting (receipting) and banking (departmental banking) cash and cheques. \nThe Revenue Management Office is responsible for the administration and supervision of all University banking. The Revenue Management Office is situated in the basement of the Clocktower Building, Dunedin.\nThere are also Cashiers located at the Otago Dental and Medical Schools and the Christchurch and Wellington Schools of Medicine.\nSecurity of cash on departmental premises\nNo department can hold more than $500 of cash and cheques. One member of staff should be responsible and ensure that all monies are kept in a safe or lockable cash box secured in a locked cupboard or drawer with secure overnight storage. Cash should be counted out of public view.\nCash should not be sent through the internal mail to the Revenue Management Office for banking \u2013 any cash should be delivered in person.\nWhere departments hold petty cash for cash requirements please contact the Accounts Payable Manager, Accounts Department.\nWhere significant amounts of cash are likely to be collected, appropriate security should be arranged to ensure the safety of staff. Contact the Revenue Management Office for further information regarding security.\nFrequency of departmental banking\nBanking should be done weekly unless receipts exceed $500, in which case banking must be done on the day. Special arrangements to exceed the weekly criteria can be made with the Cashier, however these will not supersede the $500 requirement.\nDepartments with EFTPOS facilities should liaise with the Cashiers Section in respect of banking times and frequency.\nStandard banking procedure\nThere are two methods of departmental banking:\n\nthrough Cashiers Section, Registry\ndirect lodgement to University's bank account\n\n Both methods require the use of a sub receipt book and a banking summary form described in the next sections and available from the  Revenue Management Office.\n\n\nFor banking through the Cashiers Section     Deliver banking to the Revenue Management Office in the Clock Tower Building who will check the cash and cheques and the validity of the general ledger codes and invoice numbers, then a Cashiers receipt will be issued while the person depositing the banking is present.\n\nFor direct lodgements to the University's bank account     Deliver the banking to a branch of the National Bank of New Zealand for deposit to the University's bank account. Deposit slips for this purpose can be arranged by the Revenue Management Office.\n\nOnce the deposit has taken place, promptly fax or email the Revenue Management Office a copy of the banking summary form to identify the deposited credit to the University's bank account.\nThe Revenue Management Office will receipt this deposit to the supplied ledger codes and invoice numbers as per the banking summary.\nThe receipt number can be located from the ledger code in Finance One for your reference for the deposit.\nIssue of Sub Receipts\nThe Revenue Management Office issues receipts for all departmental banking. Departments issue Sub Receipts for any funds they receive.\nSub Receipts must be issued and signed for all funds received. The only exception is student tuition fees which will be processed by the Revenue Management Office, Registry and Christchurch and Wellington Schools of Medicine and the University's Auckland Office. WSM, CSM and the Auckland Office should itemise the student numbers, names and year to which the fee payments relate on the banking summary form.\nThe supporting documentation for each Sub Receipt should be held in the department (with the exception of student tuition fees).\nLodgements should not include Sub Receipts from more than one Sub Receipt book.\nSub Receipts Register form\nA Sub Receipt Register form is on the cover of each Sub Receipt book. This should be maintained by the Department for audit purposes.\nThe register form should be completed for every banking by entering:\n\nThe sub receipt numbers from the banking summary form\nTotal dollars receipted\nThe date\nSignature of person completing the banking\nEnter the receipt number and date of the receipt once the Cashiers have receipted the banking. The receipt number can be found under the general ledger code in Finance One.\n\nOnce the sub receipt book is completed, this is held by the Department.\nAny cancelled sub receipts should be noted on the front form and both copies left in the sub receipt book (marked cancelled).\nNote: Where a cash register is used that provide till tapes and totals at the end of each day, the use of a sub receipt is not required. However, these till tapes must be held in the Department as documentation agreeing to the banking summary. Attach these tapes to the relevant banking summary form copy which is held by the Department for audit purposes. Do not send till tapes to the Revenue Management Office.\nCash and cheques\nOn receipt\nAll cheques must be made payable to University of Otago, not the department or any other name. The University of Otago is the only payee for all inwards remittances as per the Bills of Exchange Amendment Act 1995. It is recommended that departments obtain a stamp to cross cheques made out in person \u2013 \u201cUniversity of Otago \u2013 Not Transferable\u201d.\nOverseas drafts or cheques must NOT be stamped on the front and should be entered on a separate banking summary form. Overseas cheques in foreign currency will be converted to New Zealand currency by the Revenue Management Office at the current day's exchange rates and the converted amount will be credited to the nominated debtor or ledger account. The Cashiers receipt will show the New Zealand amount banked.\nNote: overseas drafts/cheques must meet certain criteria in order to be banked. If the criteria are not met, items cost a minimum of $50 to be sent overseas \u201con collection\u201d. In this case the Revenue Management Office will advise the department concerned so payment can be arranged by an alternative method. Contact the Revenue Management Office for further information.\nThe number of the sub-receipt issued should be written on the reverse of the cheque. When paying in person, the payee should also put their name, local address and telephone number on the back of the cheque. This saves time in pursuing dishonoured cheques should this occur.\nSurpluses/deficits \u2013 ideally there should be none but if these occur they are to be advised in the first instance to the cashier who will advise procedures. Should there be a recurrence the internal auditor is to be advised.\nFor banking\nDollar notes: Banknotes are counted by weighing, so to save time for bank staff when weighing them, please don't fold the notes nor hold them together with bands, paper clips etc. Simply flatten them and put all notes together in order of denomination and put one rubber band around the whole lot. A full bundle is $20s \u2013 $2,000.00; $10s \u2013 $1,000.00; $5s \u2013 $500.00 (NB: If you have enough for a \u201cfull bundle\u201d as above, this should be separated within its own rubber band, otherwise all notes should be banded into one pile).\nCoins: Coin is also counted by weighing, therefore if you have a full bag in any one denomination, please ensure it holds only $100 gold (or $10 silver). If you have lesser amounts than $100 (or $10), please bag each denomination separately i.e. do not mix the various coins, as wrong denominations in wrong bags will create problems when weighing the coin. If the coin is less than $20.00 it can all go in one bag. Further to this, please do not make up bags to $100 (or $10) with different denominations.\nRounding policy\nFrom 1 August 2006 the following rounding will apply to cash transactions:\n\nWhere the total price ends in 5 cents or less \u2013 round down to the nearest 10c.\nWhere the total price ends in 6 cents or more \u2013 round up to the nearest 10c.\n\nDishonoured cheques\nIf a cheque is dishonoured by the bank as \u201cRefer to Drawer/Account Closed or Payment Stopped,\u201d the Cashier's receipt will be reversed by journal and a copy of this and the cheque sent to the department to obtain repayment \u2013 it is recommended this be in cash or a bank cheque. A sub receipt should be issued for the repayment and the cheque included on the banking summary crediting the appropriate general ledger code.\nIn general\nPersonal cheques are not to be cashed, or have change given.\nPreparation of banking summary forms\nA banking summary form must be used for every banking whether through the Revenue Management Office or a direct lodgement to the bank. The forms are available in Excel format by using one of the templates listed below. The spreadsheet format will ensure that additions and extensions are correct and will automatically calculate GST and the banking totals.\nThere are four banking summary forms for use:\n\nGeneral Ledger Only\nGeneral Ledger and Debtors Only\nCredit Card Only\nEftpos Only\n\nThese forms are available at the Financial Services Forms Store.\nThere are two methods for completing the banking summary form:\n1. Entering into Excel spreadsheet on computer:\nAdd all sub receipts issued since the last banking, entering the total sum in the sub receipt-book.\nKey the sub receipt numbers covering the lodgement in the space provided on the banking summary form along with department name, date of lodgement, contact name and telephone number.\nAnalyse and enter particulars and individual general ledger codes or invoice numbers into the spreadsheet in the appropriate fields, entering the total sums for each code in the Total column \u2013 the GST and Sub Totals will automatically calculate. If the Total figure is GST exempt enter a 'Z' into the appropriate \"Z=No GST\" field \u2013 the GST amount will change to \u201cN/A\u201d (not applicable) and the Sub Total figure will amend accordingly.\nEnsure the automatically calculated Grand Total sum at the bottom of the spreadsheet agrees with the previously recorded total in the sub receipt-book.\nEnter cash, cheque, EFTPOS or credit card details into the appropriate fields at the top right hand corner of the banking summary spreadsheet.\nThe Total Banking figure must agree with the Grand Total of banking summary. If it doesn't match, the narration \u201cDOESN'T BALANCE!\u201d will automatically display, only disappearing when the two figures are matched.\nPrint the spreadsheet and sign the banking summary.\nCredit card, EFTPOS or overseas funds should be entered on separate banking summary forms.\n\n 2. Handwritten on banking summary form:\nAdd all sub receipts issued since the last banking, entering the total sum both in the sub receipt-book and in the Grand Total section of the departmental banking summary sheet.\nWrite the sub receipt numbers covering the lodgement in the space provided on the banking summary form along with department name, date of lodgement, contact name, signature and telephone number.\nAnalyse and enter individual general ledger codes or invoice numbers and amounts to be credited in the appropriate fields. Ensure this breakdown correctly adds to the Grand Totals.\nCalculate GST on sums being credited to General Ledger account codes and extend to the Total column.\nWhen payment is received for an invoice, the invoice number MUST be entered. GST is not deducted from invoices.\nEnter cash, cheque, EFTPOS or credit card details on the banking summary. The Total Banking figure must agree with the Grand Total of banking summary.\nCredit card or overseas funds should be entered on separate banking summary forms.\n\n\nTreatment of GST on receipts\n\n Donations and \u201cUnconditional Gifts exempt from GST\u201d\nExtra care must be taken with \u201cdonations\u201d. If the donation is made as a result of the provision of goods or services then IRD do not consider this a donation and the payment must have GST deducted. The donation must be given without conditions and this exemption will apply only in rare instances.\nIf a remittance is received from a non-profit body and is believed to represent an \u201cunconditional gift\u201d the cheque must be forwarded to the Registry Revenue Management Office, together with full supporting documentation. The Revenue Management Office will ensure that the GST treatment is correct based on the information supplied. If there is any doubt, the University will set out in a letter its understanding for the receipt to clarify the most appropriate GST treatment. It is likely that GST will be deducted from the receipt as the IRD impose severe penalties where tax is not returned according to the law. Hence we take a conservative approach in evaluating these situations.\nAn unconditional gift has a special meaning for GST purposes. Generally it is a payment made to the University where the donor receives no \u201cidentifiable direct value benefit\u201d as a result. However, if a donor is provided with a GST tax invoice in respect of a sum received the parties are acknowledging that there has been a supply of goods and services.\nA donor may be assumed to have made an unconditional gift even though a condition, specifying the purpose for which it may be used, is attached to the gift. This is provided the gift is voluntary, for the purposes of the University, and the donor received no \u201cidentifiable direct value benefit\u201d.  It is only in circumstances where the entity paying the university is not registered for GST where this will make any difference. This is because the GST component of any payment made by a registered person will be recovered from the IRD.\nIf your department receives money which may fit into this category, but you are unsure, please contact the Revenue Management Office in the first instance \u2013 they have access to specialist advice.\nAgency accounts\nSome departments perform receipting functions on behalf of parties external to the University (the principal). For example Recreation Services collect subs for some sports clubs. The receipts from these activities are kept in an agency account. This money is not owned by the University and normally no GST is to be deducted as the principal is responsible for returning the GST, if you believe you are carrying out an agency function but are unsure, contact the Revenue Management Office for advice.\nPayments from overseas\nEach payment will be treated on a one to one individual basis and the cheque should be forwarded to the Registry Revenue Management Office, together with full documentation. The staff will ensure that the GST treatment is correct based on the information supplied.\n\n\nEFTPOS\nElectronic Funds Transfer \u2013 Point of Sale units have been installed in some departments where significant amounts of receipts are collected. Benefits will arise from reduced labour for cash handling, better security as less cash is on hand, guaranteed payment for valid transactions (no dishonoured cheques), quicker to process than cheques, and increased customer satisfaction on payment options. The only fees associated with an EFTPOS machine is the rental cost and ETSL charge.\nPoints to note regarding University EFTPOS transactions are:\nWhile EFTPOS terminals can accept both debit and credit cards each terminal needs to be set up to handle credit card transactions, if your terminal does not accept credit cards, please contact the Revenue Management Office.\nCash is not to be issued from the EFTPOS sites. EFTPOS is to be offered as a method of payment only.\nA daily &lquo;financial settlement time\u201d needs to be chosen for each day's transactions, the $ total at this settlement time being credited to the University's bank account daily. This will normally be a time that suits each type of operation i.e. a Hall, a department, a business activity. The EFTPOS terminal is settled at the nominated time so to obtain totals which are entered on the EFTPOS banking summary which is to be faxed to the Revenue Management Office each working day.\nBecause an EFTPOS receipt is produced for the customer with each transaction it will not be necessary to issue individual sub receipts, but when the terminal is \u201csettled\u201d daily a sub receipt should be written for the bulk total of the EFTPOS transactions.\nThe Revenue Management Office will coordinate installation and necessary procedures associated with EFTPOS and can advise the associated costs.\n\n\nCredit card receipts\n Visa and Mastercard will be accepted by the University for all payments except for the following:\n\nAll student fees\nStudent accommodation payments\nPayments for amounts on debtor statements\n\n Credit cards other than Visa and Mastercard will not be accepted.\nAll credit card payments incur a merchant service charge. This will be charged to the department accepting the payment. The current charge is 1.55 per cent of the value of the transaction. This is subject to change.\nDepartmental applications for accepting payment by credit card should be forwarded to the Revenue Accountant for consideration.\nProcedure:\nIssue a sub-receipt for credit card payments.\nA separate banking summary form must be used for credit card transactions.\nA ledger expenditure code must be provided on the banking summary in order to debit the merchant service charge.\nThe detail required to process a mail order transaction includes:\n\nCardholder's name\nExpiry date of credit card\nCardholder's number\n$NZD amount\nSignature\nCard Security Code (three digit number on the reverse side of the credit card)\n\nPayment details are to be attached to the banking summary form.\nThe Revenue Management Office will advise if any transactions are declined, departments are advised to delay the dispatch of purchased goods until the receipt for credit card banking is received in the department.\nSecurity of credit card information\nCredit card transactions sent to Financial Services Cashiers Office for processing:\nThe processing of all transactions where the card is not present will be done by the Revenue Management Office. Departments MUST ensure that any credit card detail and information sent to the Revenue Management Office is not copied, replicated or stored electronically in any fashion.\nThe Revenue Management Office will ensure all information is held in a secure place with restricted access.\nFor information on University Purchase Cards refer to the Purchase Card Policy and Procedure.\n\n\nCredit card gateway\n\n University procedures\nAll departments wishing to use this website must submit an ecommerce application form to the Revenue Management Office, Financial Services Division for each activity they wish to set up to connect to this secure site.\nThe Revenue Management Office will then determine if the ecommerce site is the most efficient way to receive the transactions. Once this is approved, the proposed web site will be checked by the ITS security officer and an access code for the site allocated. This access code identifies all payments to that particular department and allocates a general ledger code for receipting of the funds.\nDepartments will construct their own web page for each activity, e.g. an upcoming conference. On this page customers should be able to select various options, e.g. conference registration only or conference registration plus accommodation. Once the customer has selected their requirements, they will click on a link to enable them to make the payment by credit card. This link will direct the customer to the University's secure payment page where the credit card details are entered and the transaction sent to the bank.\nWhen this has been completed the cardholder will be re-routed back to the department's web page where they will be presented with a status page, including a tax invoice / receipt if the transaction is successful. The receipt / invoice shall comply with bank guidelines as set out in the following example: Credit Card Gateway Sample Invoice/Receipt Form\nAccess to reports which will give a summary of card payments will be made available to departments.\nA total settlement figure of all payments processed each day through the payment page will settle to the University's bank account. An automated receipt batch will be created daily crediting the general ledger codes set out on the ecommerce application form for that particular web page. This batch will also debit Departments with admin and bank fees applying to each transaction.\nCredit card numbers will not be held in departments for security reasons.\nAny refund requests will be passed to the Revenue Management Office to action. Refunds will be processed to the same credit card as the initial transaction.\nThe process\n\n\nFill out the application form and return to Revenue Management Office.\nThe Revenue Management Office will email you an activity key which is for you to develop and test your website.\nWhen ready to go live contact the cashiers who will then set up a live activity and provide you with the new LIVE activity.\nAll that is required to change your test site to LIVE site collecting data is to replace the test activity key with the live activity key and change your URL to point to the live credit card gateway, by removing \u201c_test\u201d from the original URL you were provided for testing purposes.\n\nRevenue Management Office do have the contact details for a PHP designer should you need to contract one, otherwise contact ITS who may be able to provide you with contact details of an ITS consultant that can help you.\nAn information pack containing sample code for interfacing with the credit card gateway, documentation and sample invoices is available from: http://ecommerce.otago.ac.nz/\nFor gateway issues contact the Revenue Management Office.\nAs you are collecting personal information, you need to take steps to secure the information in accordance with the privacy act.\nThe Revenue Management Office may request information from you regarding a transaction.\nIf a cardholder should ever dispute a transaction, the University's bank will require us to pass all relevant information to them in the dispute process.\nAt a minimum please make sure you collect and retain the following:\n\nName of person completing form\nContact details for the above including phone number and address if possible\n\n"}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Sensitive_Expenditure_Procedure_and_Guidelines", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Sensitive_Expenditure_Procedure_and_Guidelines.html", "scope": "This is a University-wide procedure and guidelines, applying to all University staff or individuals including the University's Council members and students, where they are incurring costs on the University's behalf.", "purpose": "The purpose of these procedures is to provide guidance to staff and other relevant individuals on the application of the University's Sensitive Expenditure Policy. \nApproval of sensitive expenditure should be given: only when the person approving the expenditure is satisfied that the principles in the Sensitive Expenditure Policy have been adequately metbefore the expenditure is incurred, wherever practicalonly when an approved budget and delegated authority existby a person senior to the person who will benefit or who might be perceived to benefit from the sensitive expenditureIn the case of the Vice-Chancellor, final approval shall be given by the Chancellor.In the case of the Chancellor, final approval shall be given by the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee.In the case of the Convenor of the Audit and Risk Committee, final approval shall be given by the Pro-Chancellor.In the case of all other Council members, final approval shall be given by the Chancellor.If staff are unsure about the escalation of approvals they should contact their Finance Associate.Where Sensitive Expenditure is required to be approved by Deans, Pro-Vice-Chancellors, Heads of Division or the Vice-Chancellor, the relevant form should be completed: Event approval form (PDF)Gift approval form (PDF)Donation approval form (PDF)Where Sensitive Expenditure is required to be approved by Heads of Departments or budget holders this approval can be granted in a method deemed appropriate by the authoriser.Approvals can be granted in principle or for a series of events at the discretion of the approver.", "content": " 1.

Claims and supporting documentation\nClaims and supporting documentation should be of the same type and standard outlined in the Financial Delegations Policy except that greater detail should be provided where the documentation does not fully explain why the sensitive expenditure was necessary. It is a requirement for sensitive expenditure that supporting documentation is original, or scanned / photograph images of the original.\u00a0Receipts and other supporting documentation must be itemised, and clearly show GST for NZ transactions.It is expected that staff will claim their reimbursement within three months of incurring the expenditure.\n3. Use of University-owned business units\nUniversity-owned business units must be used wherever possible. This includes, but is not limited to, the University Union, Residential Colleges and UniPrint. Therefore any goods or services covered by the Sensitive Expenditure Policy will be subject to this directive.\n4. Travel and accommodation expenditure\nThe University's policy and procedures for travel and travel related expenditure can be found at: Travel and Travel Related Costs PolicyTravel Planning Procedures\n5. Entertainment and hospitality expenditure with external parties\nEntertainment and hospitality is defined as business expenditure usually for the purposes of: building relationshipsrepresentation of the organisation, orreciprocity of hospitalityThis expenditure can cover a range of expenditure from coffee with a research colleague while at a conference to a fully catered alumni event.For the purposes of this procedure and guidelines staff, students, contractors, suppliers and potential suppliers are not considered to be external parties.The principles of a justified business purpose, and moderate and conservative expenditure are particularly relevant.In most instances the guidelines pertaining to meals and alcohol should apply. In instances where the expenditure may not meet the guidelines pertaining to meals and alcohol staff should be prepared to demonstrate why the spending was appropriate.Approval must be gained from the person holding delegated authority to expend the budget being charged. If the person holding the delegated authority could be a beneficiary, or a perceived beneficiary, of the expenditure then the one-up principle for sign-off must apply. Where practical this approval should be sought before the entertainment or hospitality expenditure has been incurred.\n6. Farewell and retirement functions\nExpenditure on farewell and retirement functions for staff members will only be at the University's expense if they are formal, organised by a University department and are moderate and conservative.The time of day, size, scale and nature of the function should be commensurate with the staff member's length of service and role. It is not expected that formal farewell functions paid by the University will be held for staff with less than five years of service.The first option for a venue for farewell and retirement functions should be on campus. If the function must be held off-campus due to unavailability of a suitable on campus venue, then the choice of venue must be appropriate and moderately priced.Approval must be gained before the event from the person holding delegated authority to expend the budget being charged. This approval can be granted even when the person holding the delegated authority could be a beneficiary, or a perceived beneficiary.\n7. Staff recognition, team building, retreats, student events and Christmas functions\nFor any event under this category it should be demonstrable that the event has a justified business purpose and the expenditure is moderate and conservative.Where possible the venue for events under this category should be on campus. If the function must be held off-campus due to unavailability of a suitable on campus venue, then the choice of venue must be appropriate and moderately priced.Approval must be gained before the event from the person holding delegated authority to expend the budget being charged. If the person holding the delegated authority could be a beneficiary, or a perceived beneficiary, of the expenditure then the one-up principle for sign-off must apply. When the person holding the delegated authority or the person granting one-up approval is an invited attendee, rather than the organiser or host they can still grant approval.Low value events, such as morning teas, afternoon teas, and staff/student events can be approved by a Head of Department or Service Division provided they aren't frequent and they follow the principles set out in the Sensitive Expenditure Policy. This applies even when the Head of Department or Service Division are also in attendance at the event.Where the University is providing low value catering primarily intended for students approval should come from the Head of Department, Head of Service Division or from Directors, Head of Service or Managers within Operations, External Engagement, Research Office and Student and Academic Services. This is also the case if staff (including the authoriser) benefit from this catering where the benefit is incidental to the purpose of the catering.If meals are included in the cost of these activities, then the principles for those categories of expenditure, found elsewhere in these procedures should apply.The University has an organisation wide Graduation function and as such if departments wish to hold their own function these should be modest and reasonably priced.\n8. Meals and alcohol\nMeals must have a clear business purpose and be moderately priced. As a guide they should not exceed NZD$65 per head for dinner and NZD$45 per head for lunch. These amounts include non-alcoholic beverages. Dollar values specified are in New Zealand dollars and inclusive of GST.Where possible the venue for meals should be in University owned and catered premises.Except where the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor provides approval in advance, the University will not fund the purchase of alcohol for University events or in relation to staff travel, hosting, sustenance or entertainment.\u00a0\u00a0Staff requests, which will only be approved in exceptional circumstances, should be directed to the Vice-Chancellor.The University would not normally pay for a staff member or University representative's partner's meal unless the presence of a partner is of benefit to the University, such as for cultural reasons. Permission should be sought from the approver prior to the meal occurring.The cost of staff or University representative travel from and to home for a local University function is not a business expense so will not be paid by the University.\n9. Caf\u00e9 meetings\nCaf\u00e9 meetings between staff (or between staff and students) will not be funded by the University. If staff choose to meet in a caf\u00e9 the expense is personal, not business related.Caf\u00e9 meetings with external guests will be paid by the University where it is appropriate to do so. In such cases, it is a requirement that University-owned caf\u00e9s are used wherever possible.\n10. Recruitment dinners\nDinners with staff and prospective candidates are acceptable for the recruitment of academic or executive positions. Staff attendance should normally be limited to four with any exceptions to be prior approved by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor.Dinners with staff and prospective candidates for the recruitment of all other professional staff positions are not acceptable except in exceptional circumstances, in which case the approval of one of the Vice-Chancellor, a Deputy Vice-Chancellor, a Pro-Vice-Chancellor or the Chief Operating Officer is required.\n11. Koha and Pacific Gifting\nThe University has separate policies that cover Koha and Pacific Gifting payments: Koha Payments Policy and ProcedurePacific Gifting Policy, Procedure and Guidelines\n12. Giving gifts\nThe giving of gifts to University staff where the University makes a contribution in addition to funds raised through contributions by staff is only acceptable in the following circumstances: Farewells and retirements for staff with more than five years of service to the UniversityThe bereavement of a close family member of a staff memberOn the occasion of a staff member's serious illness or accidentThe giving of gifts to external parties or individuals where the University makes a contribution is only acceptable in the following circumstances: Recognition and thanks for unpaid work given by non-staff members for the benefit of the University.A meeting, event or ceremony where the giving or exchanging of gifts is customary, other than Koha or Pacific Gifts which is covered elsewhere in these procedures and is subject to a separate policy.Any gifts up to and including NZD$100 must be pre-approved by the head of the Division responsible for the cost.Except where the Chancellor or Vice-Chancellor provides written approval in advance, the University will not fund the purchase of alcohol as a gift.Gifts for purposes not included in clause 12 (a) and (b) or for a value above NZD$100 will require the approval of the Vice-Chancellor. This function has been delegated to the Chief Financial Officer to review in the first instance.Only one gift from the University should be purchased and this should be arranged by the line manager of the individual receiving the gift.Under no circumstances can gifts given by the University be exchanged for cash by the recipient.Gifts for other events (including births, engagements, weddings, birthdays, Easter and Christmas) will not be funded by the University.\n13.Donations\nA donation is a payment (in money or by way of goods or services) made voluntarily and without expectation of receiving goods or services in return.All donations must be pre-approved by the Vice-Chancellor.\n14. Sale of surplus assets to staff\nThe University's procedures relating to sales of surplus assets to staff is contained in the Fixed Assets Procedure.\n15. Loyalty reward scheme benefits\nLoyalty reward schemes provide a benefit to the customer for continuing to use a particular supplier of goods or services. Generally, the rewards tend to be given to the named individual who orders or purchases the goods or services, regardless of who has paid for them.In such cases it is impractical to control the use of these rewards, but as far as is practicable, staff should use loyalty rewards for the benefit of the University or for business-related activity.\n16. Private use of University assets\nAny physical item owned, leased, or borrowed by the University is considered an asset for the purpose of this section. This includes photocopiers, phones, digital devices, internet access, and stationery. As a general rule, staff should not use University assets for personal reasons unless approval is obtained from the manager of the department responsible for the asset and a reasonable charge is made that recovers at least the direct costs of that usage. However, it is recognised that it is sometimes impossible to avoid a personal element of use during business use of an asset. When this occurs it should be clear that the personal use was secondary to the use for business purposes and that no additional cost was incurred by the University as a result of the personal use. It is the responsibility of the staff member to provide this evidence if requested.\n17. Clothing and grooming\nOther than uniforms and health and safety-related clothing, staff should not be clothed or groomed at the University's expense when they are engaged in a normal business activity (whether in New Zealand or overseas), except when allowed for under an employment agreement.\n18. Care of dependants\nPayments for the care of dependants, other than under employment agreements, are not permitted unless there is a clear business purpose, and prior approval is received from the Vice-Chancellor or the Director of Human Resources.\n19. Miscellaneous staff support and welfare expenditure\nThere is a wide variety of expenditure that can fall into this category of sensitive expenditure, and can include club and professional memberships, motor vehicles use, and access to papers, magazines and periodicals.The following principles shall apply to this category of expenditure: Payments and rewards in lieu of, or additional to, a staff member's usual periodic remuneration can be made where they are provided for in the staff member's employment agreement.Where a payment or reward is not provided for in a staff member's employment agreement, prior approval must be obtained from the Vice-Chancellor or the Director of Human Resources before a payment can be made or a reward provided.Both Financial Services and Human Resources must be contacted prior to seeking approval to ensure that the payment or reward is appropriate and consistent with similar circumstances and that any taxation implications are clearly understood and appropriately addressed.\n20. Compliance\nTransactions are monitored regularly by Financial Services Division and the Office of Risk, Assurance and Compliance for compliance with this policy.The Vice-Chancellor or any approver as per clauses 1(b) through to 1(f) has the authority to disallow any expenditure considered to be unreasonable.Breaches of this policy will be reported to the Vice-Chancellor and may result in disciplinary action."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Special_Consideration_in_Student_Assessment_Procedures", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Special_Consideration_in_Student_Assessment_Procedures.html", "scope": "University-wide.", "purpose": "Special Consideration is the means by which the University seeks to ensure just and equitable treatment of students who suffer unexpected and significant impairment (e.g. serious illness) in relation to assessment tasks, including final examinations and internal assessment. \nthe procedures for applying for Special Considerationprocesses and authorities for assessing whether a student's impairment, and the evidence of such impairment, is sufficient for Special Consideration provisions to be applied, andappropriate academic outcomes in cases where it is determined that Special Consideration should be applied.", "content": "1. General principles\nSpecial Consideration is intended to ensure students who have significant and unexpected impairment are not unduly disadvantaged in assessment activities.The aim of Special Consideration is to reduce the impact of impairment on assessment as practicable; a complete reduction of the impact of impairment is not guaranteed.Special Consideration shall not be used to unfairly advantage students who are impaired in assessment, i.e. through the provision of academic outcomes which the student would have been unlikely to achieve if they had not been impaired.Special Consideration is appropriate for some kinds of unexpected impairment in relation to assessment, but in certain circumstances other University provisions may be more appropriate: General study support for students with impairments through Disability Information and Support Alternative arrangements for assessment in cases of ongoing and known impairment affecting assessment (note that this normally prevents approval of Special Consideration on the basis of the same impairment)Withdrawal under exceptional circumstances, where significant and unexpected impairment prevents completion of a paper or papers (note that this cannot normally be applied for if Special Consideration in final examinations has been approved for the paper in question).For further advice on the best option for their circumstances, students are advised to contact the AskOtago (university@otago.ac.nz, 0800 80 80 98) or Disability Information and Support.Applications for Special Consideration shall not be considered if received after the results for the relevant assessment have been made available to students.Special Consideration provisions are not available for Special Examinations.Personal information provided by students in support of Special Consideration applications will be treated in confidence and with care, in accordance with the University's Privacy Policy and Privacy Statement.\n2. Applications for Special Consideration\nStudents seeking Special Consideration in final examinations should apply via their eVision portal unless the application relates to a Specified Health Sciences Programme, in which case alternative application provisions may be in place.\u00a0\u00a0Applications must be made no later than five calendar days after the last final examination for which Special Consideration is being sought.Applications for Special Consideration in final examinations should include relevant evidence of impairment: in cases based on medical impairment (i.e. illness or injury), a University-prescribed Health Declaration, including an assessment by a health professional, is requiredin cases based on non-medical impairment (e.g. bereavement, property damage, interpersonal issues) such other documentation as may verify the applicant's circumstances is requiredin all cases, a University-prescribed statement confirming impairment, completed by a person other than the applicant, is recommended.The University reserves the right to require that an applicant provide a statement confirming impairment and/or such additional documentation as may be needed to assess or confirm impairment.Students seeking Special Consideration in internal assessment should apply in writing to the Head of Department concerned (or nominee).\u00a0\u00a0Applications should make clear the paper(s) and assessment activities to which the application applies and, if appropriate, a requested outcome (e.g. an extension for an assignment).\u00a0\u00a0Application should be made in a timely fashion (the meaning of which may vary based on the assessment activity in question and the nature of the student's impairment).For Special Consideration in internal assessment students should provide a medical certificate or such other supporting evidence as is appropriate to verify their circumstances. Note that departments may waive the requirement for documented supporting evidence in relation to less significant internal assessment (normally assessments worth less than 10 per cent of the overall mark) and/or requests for small extensions on due dates for assessments (normally less than 5 days).In exceptional circumstances, a health professional may make a recommendation that a student not sit an examination or test, where sitting such an examination or test may be seriously detrimental to the health of the student or to others.\u00a0\u00a0In such circumstances it is the student's responsibility to provide evidence of this recommendation as part of his or her application for Special Consideration, except where the recommendation is made by Student Health in relation to a final examination.\n3. Assessment of Special Consideration in final examinations (excluding Specified Health Sciences Programmes)\nThe Examinations Office shall assess Special Consideration applications in relation to each examination for which the student claims impairment, taking account of: the extent to which the evidence provided supports the student's claim of impairmentthe length of the relevant impairment and its proximity to the examination, andthe severity of the relevant impairment.For Special Consideration to be possible, the relevant impairment must be unexpected (see definitions above) and some part of the impairment must occur within the 14 days prior to, and/or on the day of, the examination.For each examination for which Special Consideration is applied for Student Administration shall determine either: that Special Consideration be granted, with an assessment of High Impairment, orthat Special Consideration be granted, with an assessment of Medium Impairment, orthat the level of impairment, or the evidence of impairment, is insufficient for Special Consideration to be granted. Any paper for which Student Administration grants Special Consideration will be marked \u201c SC \u201d on the student's academic transcript, except when there is no change in the academic outcome under clause 4 below.Where Special Consideration is granted, the application will be forwarded to the relevant department for determining the outcome of Special Consideration (see clause 4 below).\u00a0\u00a0Full details of impairment will not be provided, but the assessment of High Impairment or Medium Impairment will be made known to the department.Where a student has a history of seeking Special Consideration for similar circumstances across multiple examination periods, the Student Administration may: decline Special Consideration on the grounds that the impairment in question is not unexpected, and/oradvise the student that Special Consideration will not be subsequently granted on the basis of the same impairment.The Examinations Office shall maintain internal guidelines to ensure consistency in assessing Special Consideration applications.\n4. Academic outcomes of Special Consideration in final examinations\nTo assist in determining an appropriate academic outcome, internal assessment and other results may be used to calculate a student's expected (i.e. unimpaired) performance in an examination versus the student's actual (i.e. impaired) performance, noting that: significant differences in class mark distributions and averages between internal assessment and the final examination in the paper concerned should be taken into account (e.g. through weighting marks to reflect these differences)for students with High Impairment, internal assessment marks in the relevant paper should be used for calculating expected performance, but only where at least 20 per cent of the final mark is based on internal assessment and where the department considers internal assessment a reasonable guide to expected performance in the examination (otherwise an expected mark should not be calculated in High Impairment cases)for students with Medium Impairment, final results in other papers (preferably at similar levels and/or in similar subject areas) may also be used as a guide to expected performance where internal assessment in the paper concerned does not provide a reasonable indication of expected performance.Where a student has Medium Impairment a department may choose from the following standard academic outcomes, or choose an Aegrotat pass as specified under clause 4(e) below: The student's performance in the relevant examination was at or above expected performance \u2013 no action.The student did not sit the scheduled examination \u2013 no action (Special Consideration will not normally be granted where a student with Medium Impairment fails to sit an examination).The student's performance in the relevant examination was below expected performance \u2013 examination mark adjustment up to 5 per cent of the total possible marks available for the final examination.The student's expected performance in the relevant examination could not be determined \u2013 examination mark adjustment up to 5 per cent of the total possible marks available for the final examination (with the addition of 3 per cent being the recommended outcome in the absence of any other relevant factors).Where a student has High Impairment a department may choose from the following standard academic outcomes or the other outcomes available under clauses 4(d) and (e) below: The student's performance in the relevant examination was at or above expected performance \u2013 no action.The student did not sit the scheduled examination \u2013 Special Examination.The student's performance in the relevant examination was below expected performance but expected performance can be approximated with a limited mark adjustment \u2013 examination mark adjustment up to 10 per cent of the total possible marks available for the final examination.The student's performance in the scheduled examination was below expected performance and expected performance cannot be approximated with a limited mark adjustment \u2013 Special Examination.The student's expected performance in the relevant examination could not be determined \u2013 Special Examination.Notwithstanding the standard outcomes for High Impairment in clause 4(c): a department may recommend no action instead of a Special Examination where a student with High Impairment has very poor performance in significant internal assessment (a mark of less than 30 per cent in internal assessment where internal assessment for the paper is worth at least 30 per cent of the final result)a department may recommend a Special Examination in any case of High Impairment where it is felt that this is justified and will not unfairly advantage the student.An Aegrotat pass may be appropriate where a student has demonstrated competence in the paper concerned (normally through achieving a minimum C+ standard in significant internal assessment) and is close to, but not entitled to, a passing mark via a mark adjustment, and/oris entitled to, but is unlikely to be able to sit, a Special Examination, due to ongoing impairment or relevant timing factors (e.g. an Aegrotat pass may be appropriate to allow timely graduation).Aegrotat passes are not available as Special Consideration outcomes for students in Specified Health Sciences Programmes.Where possible and appropriate, a department may offer a student the choice between: an adjusted examination mark or a Special Examination, oran Aegrotat pass or a Special Examination. Departments are encouraged to consider these options where delays in sitting Special Examinations may potentially disadvantage students, particularly in terms of the provision of a timely finalised result for a paper, or where it is possible a student may prefer another justifiable outcome to a Special Examination.\u00a0\u00a0Where an Aegrotat pass is offered as an option, students should be made aware of the potential implications of this (see further information on the Examinations webpages).All mark adjustments should be applied to the final examination result rather than directly to the overall result for the paper.\u00a0\u00a0Mark adjustments should be used to approximate but not exceed expected performance (where expected performance can be determined).Where plussage is used, any mark adjustment on the basis of Special Consideration should be applied to the final examination result before a plussage decision is considered.When a student sits a Special Examination, the better of the two results from the original examination and the Special Examination shall count as the final result.\n5. Review process for Special Consideration in final examinations\nA student who is dissatisfied that Special Consideration in a final examination or examinations (excluding examinations in Specified Health Sciences Programmes) has not been granted may request that the decision be reviewed.To request a review, the student must write to the Director of Student Experience within five days of the initial decision to decline Special Consideration, detailing the grounds for requesting review, and including any additional documentation as appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0There is no formal provision for a student to present his or her case in person.On reviewing a Special Consideration decision the Director of Student Experience (or their nominee) shall consider whatever evidence he or she deems relevant, which will include: consideration of the review request letter from the studentconsideration of all documentation provided by the student and may include:consideration of the academic record of the student (if needing to determine whether marks appear consistent with claimed impairment when compared with unimpaired results)consultation with the student's Health Professionalconsultation with any parties providing statements in support of the student's caseconsultation with the student's academic department, and/orconsideration of such other evidence as may assist in making a fair and informed decision.As a result of review, the Director of Student Experience (or their nominee)\u00a0\u00a0may: uphold the initial decision not to grant Special Considerationoverturn the initial decision not to grant Special Consideration and grant Special Consideration with High Impairment, oroverturn the initial decision not to grant Special Consideration and grant Special Consideration with Medium Impairment.If, on assessing the academic outcome for a student with Medium Impairment, a department finds that the student's examination performance is well below expected performance (normally at least 15 percentage points lower than equivalent internal assessment marks), the department may request that the Director of Student Experience (or their nominee) reconsider the level of impairment; this may or may not result in the level of impairment being adjusted.\n6. Special Consideration in final examinations for Specified Health Sciences Programmes\nFor final examinations in Specified Health Sciences Programmes the appropriate department, school or faculty office shall make an assessment as to whether the student's impairment justifies Special Consideration, and if so, the academic outcome as a result of this.In so far as is practicable, assessment of Special Consideration in Specified Health Sciences Programmes should be carried out by the relevant department, school or faculty office in accordance with the Examination Office guidelines established under clause 3(f), and with the recommendations for academic outcomes in clause 4.Notwithstanding 6(b) above, where programme regulations for Specified Health Sciences Programmes detail Special Consideration processes which differ from those in these Procedures, the programme regulations shall take precedence.\n7. Special Consideration in internal assessment\nThe provision of any Special Consideration in relation to internal assessment is at the discretion of the Head of Department (or nominee) and should take account of: any relevant paper or programme regulationsfairness to the student concernedfairness to other students in the classthe significance of the assessment in question, in terms of its contribution to the final mark and resultpracticalities of providing Special Consideration, andthe requirement that students demonstrate competency to pass the paper.Special Consideration in internal assessment should normally only be granted where impairment is significant (i.e. is likely to have a demonstrable and significant effect on performance).Special Consideration should not be granted in internal assessment where a student has been granted Alternative Arrangements in relation to the same assessment on the basis of the same impairment.For assessments due in on a given date (e.g. essays, assignments, lab reports), the recommended action where Special Consideration is granted is an extension to the due date for submission.\u00a0\u00a0Extensions of five days or more should normally be accompanied by appropriate independent evidence (see clause 2(d)).For tests and other in-class assessments, the recommended options where Special Consideration is granted are: the rescheduling of an in-class assessment (e.g. a student presentation)the setting of an alternative and equivalent test or assessment activity for the student in questiona calculated score based on the student's marks from other assessments in the paper, which may include future assessments and the final examination, and which may be weighted based on class performance (i.e. the score may be increased if the class tended to grade higher on the assessment in question or vice versa)additional marks to a maximum of 10 per cent of the total possible marks available for the test or in class assessment based on the student's impairmentno change, where a test is worth less than 5 per cent of the final mark in the paper.The recommendations in clauses 7(d) or (e) do not prevent a Head of Department (or nominee) from taking alternative actions where they believe that such actions are consistent with the principles in clause 7(a).Terms and/or attendance requirements may be varied where Special Consideration is granted, so long as the academic integrity of the paper can be maintained.Care should be taken where a student requests Special Consideration for multiple assessments in a paper, that this will not prevent the student from demonstrating competence in the paper.\u00a0\u00a0If sufficient assessment cannot be completed, the student should be advised to consider applying for withdrawal under exceptional circumstances (see clause 1(d) above)."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Staff_and_Non_Staff_Reimbursement_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Staff_and_Non_Staff_Reimbursement_Procedure.html", "scope": "This policy applies to all staff of the University and individuals seeking financial reimbursement from the University.\u00a0\u00a0This policy does not apply to suppliers of goods and services to the University.", "purpose": "To set out the University's procedures for the reimbursement of staff and non-staff. \nAll claims for reimbursements must be made using Finance One.The University's Divisional Services and Administration can be contacted for assistance in making a reimbursement claim.All expenditure must be supported by itemised electronic receipts, which must be attached to the claim form or scanned into Finance One.All reimbursement payments to University of Otago staff will be direct credited into the bank account held in the University's payroll system.Reimbursement payments to non-staff will be made into a bank account.

Responsibilities of students\nStudents are expected to fulfil the following obligations:\nStudents have a responsibility to participate actively and positively in their learning. It is expected that students will apply themselves to their study to the best of their ability, attend classes, maintain steady progress within the subject framework, respond to feedback provided, comply with workload expectations and submit required work on time.As per the Provision of Course and Study Information to Enrolled Students Policy, students are responsible for making themselves aware of all University rules and regulations pertaining to their rights and responsibilities as students and the degree for which they are enrolled, and are deemed to be aware of paper information made available to them.Students are responsible for their overall course planning and for monitoring their progress in their academic programme.Students are expected to respect the right of staff members to express views and opinions.Students are expected to take the initiative and consult appropriately when problems arise.\n3. Due process\nHoD s and PVC s are expected to receive, consider and investigate academic grievances made in writing in an open and honest way, to allow the student complainant to have a support person or whanau support at any meeting, and to be sensitive to power imbalances which may exist between students and staff.HoD s and PVC s are expected, as regards any staff implicated in a complaint, to follow the principles of natural justice by: giving notice to the staff member or staff members of any complaint against them as soon as is reasonably practicable, if it is to be investigated;before finalising any finding which may reflect adversely on a staff member, informing the staff member of the proposed outcome and allowing them the opportunity to comment, provide evidence on the matter and/or add their version of events to the record;formally recording any finding which relates to the performance of a staff member.No finding by any HoD or PVC from these proceedings can be used as a surrogate for standard disciplinary procedures in relation to the staff member concerned without being proved afresh.\n4. Procedure\nAny student who seeks the resolution of an academic grievance must follow the steps set out below. Students may seek advice and support from the OUSA Student Support Centre at any stage of the process. Staff or students may contact the University Mediator to seek assistance with the resolution of interpersonal issues as appropriate.\nStep 1 The student should, where possible and within a reasonable timeframe, attempt to resolve the grievance with the staff member(s) concerned.If the student's grievance relates to research Master's or doctoral-level study and the matter cannot be resolved directly with the staff member(s) concerned, the student should seek assistance from the postgraduate coordinator in their department. If a satisfactory resolution still cannot be reached, the student should raise their concerns with the Dean of the Graduate Research School, who is empowered to make recommendations to departments to assist with the resolution of graduate research candidate issues.Step 2 If the matter remains unresolved, the student should complain to the HoD . If the student is uncomfortable complaining directly he/she may wish to contact a student advocate, such as the student representative for the paper concerned or an OUSA support person, who can raise the issue on the student's behalf. The student may initially meet with the HoD . If the matter cannot be resolved easily and is to be fully investigated, the complaint must be made formally in writing. Written complaints should detail the precise grounds of the complaint and provide objective evidence where appropriate.Complaints under Step 2 will normally only be considered if they are made within one month of the events complained about or within ten working days of the completion of Step 1 (whichever is later). This restriction may be waived if there are good reasons for the delay in making a complaint.If the complaint involves the HoD , the student may complain to the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor ( PVC ) who shall appoint an independent party to substitute for the HoD , and that party shall investigate the complaint using the process described under clause 4(b)v below.If the HoD considers they have a conflict of interest with regards to a complaint, they should advise their PVC who shall appoint an independent party to substitute for the HoD , and that party shall investigate the complaint using the process described under clause 4(b)v below.The HoD or nominated party: must decide whether or not to investigate the complaint; and if somust give notice to any affected staff member entitled to it under clause 3(b)i of these Procedures;must liaise with relevant parties, including the student and affected staff, and consider relevant documentary evidence (e.g. relevant email communications, student teaching evaluations provided by staff, etc.) to ensure that any findings or outcomes are based on a thorough and balanced investigation of the complaint;can make formal recommendations to the involved parties with a view to resolving the dispute (this may include exploring mediation, for example with the assistance of the University Mediator);can make findings about particular disputed matters;must, before making any findings, give notice to any staff member entitled to it under section 3 (b)ii;must conclude any investigation by compiling a record of the investigation, including any agreements reached, any findings made, any steps taken as a result of those findings, and the reasons for any such steps taken;can take steps within the HoD 's ordinary powers which are the appropriate consequence of the findings or any agreement reached;must appropriately inform the student and any staff members who are the subject of the complaint of the outcome of the investigation, including providing a written statement of their findings.Step 3 If the student is dissatisfied with the outcome of the complaint, the student can, within ten working days of receiving written notification of the outcome, request in writing that the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor ( PVC ) review the outcome.If a staff member against whom a grievance was directed is dissatisfied with any of the findings of the HoD , the staff member can, within ten working days of receiving written notification of the outcome, request in writing that the PVC review the findings.The PVC may appoint a nominee to act on their behalf with regards to the review, in which case that nominee shall be responsible for the process as outlined under clauses 4(c)iv-v below (the nominee may not have acted for the HoD under clauses 4(b)iii or 4(b)iv above).The PVC or their nominee will, within ten working days of receiving written notice requesting a review, arrange to meet and discuss the issue with the student or staff member requesting the review. They will also meet with the Head of the relevant department (or the HoD 's nominee responsible for the initial findings). After these meetings, they will consider their response.The PVC or their nominee: may decline the request for a review from the student or staff member, in which case a written reason for this decision must be provided to the party requesting the review;may review the initial investigation, findings and outcomes, which shall include consideration of the documentation from the initial investigation carried out under clause 4(b) ('Step 2'), and may include further investigation by the PVC ; and if somay invite the parties involved to meet to attempt to facilitate a solution agreed to by all involvedmay endorse the original findings and the outcomes resulting from those findings;may overrule the initial findings and/or outcomes, in which case they must give notice to any staff member entitled to it under section 3 (b)ii, including the HoD or nominee who carried out the investigation, before finalising any revised findings;can take steps within the PVC 's ordinary powers which are the appropriate consequence of any revised findings;must conclude any review by compiling a record of the review, including any agreements reached, any findings made, any steps taken as a result of those findings, and the reasons for any such steps taken;must appropriately inform relevant parties of the outcome of the review, including providing a written statement of their findings.\n5.

Level Two and Three misconduct will result in disciplinary sanctions.\n2. Types of Academic Misconduct\nPlagiarism: copying or cutting and pasting text from others without using quotation marks or block quotes to identify that text, nor clearly indicating the source (this includes paper and electronic sources)copying visual materials, images and/or physical objects without clearly indicating the sourceusing poor paraphrasing of sentences or whole passages without referencing the original workusing another person's ideas, work or research data without acknowledgmentcopying computer files or computer code without clearly indicating their originsubmitting another student's work in whole or in part, where this is not specifically permitted in the course outlinesubmitting work that has been written by someone else on a student's behalfresubmitting portions of previously submitted work without indicating the source.Unauthorised collaboration: presenting group work in any form of assessment where individual answers are required. This does not include assessment tasks where students are expressly required or permitted to present the results of collaborative work. Unless it is explicitly stated otherwise, each student's answers should be in their own words.Multiple submissions of single assessment: submitting substantially the same work for multiple assessments; presenting work submitted previously at the University or another educational institution.Impersonation: getting someone else to participate in any assessment on one's behalf, including getting someone else to sit a test or examination on one's behalf.Use of unauthorised materials: using notes, books or other material in the completion of assessment unless expressly permitted to do so; taking calculators, computers or other electronic devices (e.g. cell phones or tablets) into a test or examination unless expressly permitted to do so.Assisting others in academic misconduct: impersonating another student in a test or examinationwriting an assignment for another studentgiving answers to another student in a test, examination or any other assessment (whether in a current or previously offered paper) by any direct or indirect meansallowing another student to copy answers in a test, examination or any other assessment.Misrepresentation: feigning disability, temporary illness or injury or exceptional circumstances beyond one's control, and then claiming special conditions and/or special consideration.Purchasing assessment: submitting for assessment material obtained from commercial essays, assignment services, other students or any other source.Falsification: falsifying or fabricating the results of one's research or laboratory assignments; presenting as true or accurate material that one knows to be false or inaccurate.Breach of ethics: a breach of a duty of confidentiality, privacy or the terms of any ethical approvals.Breach of intellectual property: using the intellectual property of others in an unauthorised manner, including copyright breach and the unauthorised sharing of the work of others.Other misconduct: actions that are deemed to contravene the values and accepted practices associated with academic integrity.\n3. Authority for Dealing with Academic Misconduct\nIn the first instance: all suspected instances of academic misconduct in in-person final examinations must be referred to the Head, Student Experienceall suspected instances of academic misconduct in online final examinations using the ExamSoft platform must be referred to the Head, Student Experienceall other suspected instances of academic misconduct, including online final examinations not using ExamSoft, must be referred to the relevant Head of Department (or nominee).Alleged instances of Level One academic misconduct, excluding those relating to doctoral degrees (see 3(d) below),\u00a0\u00a0which proceed to a full investigation shall normally be dealt with by the relevant Head of Department (or their nominee \u2013 referred to as the Head of Department henceforth).Alleged instances of Level Two and Level Three academic misconduct, excluding those relating to doctoral degrees (see 3(d) below), which proceed to a full investigation shall be dealt with by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division (or their nominee \u2013 referred to as the Pro-Vice-Chancellor henceforth) within which the relevant assessment was conducted.Alleged instances of academic misconduct in relation to doctoral degrees which proceed to a full investigation shall be dealt with by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) in consultation with the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor(s) or their nominee(s).Level Three academic misconduct and extremely serious academic misconduct in doctoral degrees shall be referred to and dealt with by the Vice-Chancellor, if the party that has determined misconduct occurred recommends that the student concerned be excluded from the University.In instances where the person who would usually have responsibility for dealing with the alleged misconduct may have a conflict of interest, for example if he or she is supervising a student whose research work is to be investigated, advice should be sought from the Head, Student Experience who will arrange for the matter to be dealt with by a different person with appropriate authority under the Academic Statute.Any delegation of authority relating to the investigation of academic misconduct, including any standing delegation or delegation due to a conflict of interest, should be documented in writing prior to any investigation taking place.\n4.Procedural Fairness\nA student shall be presumed innocent unless and until guilt is freely admitted or is determined with appropriate certainty.The University will ensure that: the student will be informed in writing of the subject matter of the complaint and the possible penalties if misconduct is found to have occurredthe student will have access to information about the allegation of misconductthe student will be given adequate notice of the process and timelines for dealing with the alleged misconductthe student will be offered the opportunity to be heard before a determination is made in relation to the alleged misconductthe process of inquiry and determination will be conducted without biasa determination will be made only on the basis of facts and documentation relevant to the alleged misconduct (this will include the referencing of the Academic Misconduct Register to ascertain whether the student has been involved in previous cases of academic misconduct)the student will be notified in writing of the outcome including reasons to explain the outcomethe student will be notified of their right of appeal in accordance with clause 5.11 of the Academic Statute 2011.\n5.Identification of Potential Misconduct\nWhere a staff member identifies activity that they believe may constitute academic misconduct, they should first determine whether this meets the threshold for formal investigation under these procedures (see clause 1(d)).Where the potential misconduct considered falls within the definition of plagiarism, the staff member should take into account: whether the student has attempted to acknowledge the work of othersthe extent of the potential plagiarismthe previous opportunities the student may have had to learn correct academic practice, andwhether the matter can be adequately addressed through marking and feedback as part of standard assessment processes.In determining whether a formal investigation is needed, staff may contact Student Administration to check the Academic Misconduct Register to determine whether the student has any previous academic misconduct which has been formally addressed through these procedures.Staff members requiring additional advice on whether identified activity meets the threshold for formal investigation should consult with the Associate Dean (Academic) in their Division.\n6. Preliminary Investigation\nA preliminary investigation shall be carried out where an activity which meets the threshold for possible academic misconduct is identified. This should usually occur within seven days of detection of the alleged offence and should determine either that: there is sufficient evidence that the matter should proceed to a full investigation, orthere is insufficient evidence to proceed, orthere is no case and the matter should proceed no further. Final ExaminationsIn relation to final examinations the preliminary investigation shall be the responsibility of the Head, Student Experience, except where 3(a)iii applies, and the steps at 6(c)i-vi shall be followedFollowing the identification of a possible academic misconduct in a final examination, normally by an examination supervisor, the Group Leader, Examinations shall: obtain whatever evidence may be possible in the circumstances, including a written statement from the examination supervisorinterview the student(s), if practicable, immediately following their departure from the examination room and invite the student to make a written statementinform the student in writing of the nature of allegation and the process for the preliminary investigationforward a copy of the script to the department so that this may be marked while any investigation is taking place, the result to be impounded pending completion of the investigationask the Student Records Office to add 'Result deferred' immediately to the student's record until a decision has been reached and, if applicable, a mark awardedpass all information relating to the instance to the Head, Student Experience.The Head, Student Experience or relevant Head of Department (or nominee) as applicable shall either: determine that a full investigation is to take place as per clause 7 below and refer the matter to the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or their nominee), providing a completed Alleged Academic Misconduct Initial Report, ordetermine that a full investigation is not warranted, inform the student of this and update their record accordingly.The Head, Student Experience, or relevant Head of Department (or nominee) for online final examinations not using ExamSoft, may exercise option 6(d)ii in any case in which the University's Examination Rules were breached, but where it is clear that a student's actions were na\u00efve and no academic advantage was gained. In such cases the student shall be issued with a warning and the misconduct shall be recorded in the Academic Misconduct Register with a note that it was dealt with under this provision.All Other CasesIn cases other than final Examinations the preliminary investigation shall be the responsibility of the relevant Head of Department or an appropriate nominee.In relation to department-run tests or examinations, the process outlined in 6(c)i-iv should be used as appropriate, with the Head of Department (or appropriate nominee) undertaking the role of the Group Leader, Examinations. In such cases the student should be informed if it is determined that a full investigation is not warranted.If it is concluded that a full investigation is warranted the Head of Department shall contact the Head, Student Experience (at academic.integrity@otago.ac.nz) who will, within two working days, provide details from the Academic Misconduct Register on whether the student has previously been involved in academic misconduct at the University.As regards the full investigation: if the alleged misconduct to be investigated relates to doctoral degrees, the Head of Department shall refer the matter to the Dean of the Graduate Research School, providing a completed Alleged Academic Misconduct Initial Report, for further investigation by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise), otherwise:if the student has previous offending recorded on the Academic Misconduct Register and/or there is significant reason to believe the alleged misconduct is deliberate, the Head of Department shall refer the matter to the Head, Student Experience, providing a completed Alleged Academic Misconduct Initial Report, for further investigation by the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or their nominee), orif there is reason to believe the alleged misconduct is unintentional or na\u00efve, and the student has no previous record of offending on the Academic Misconduct Register, the Head of Department shall conduct a full investigation as per clause 7 below.\n7. Procedure for a Full Investigation\nThe investigating party shall inform the student in writing of the subject matter of the complaint and possible penalties if academic misconduct should be found to have occurred, using the appropriate letter template available from academic.integrity@otago.ac.nz. A copy of this letter should also be sent to the Head, Student Experience.The full investigation shall consider any material from the preliminary investigation, any further evidence collected, and the student's response (see 7(c) below), and shall take account of the following factors: the extent of the misconductthe student's intentioncontextual factors including but not limited to: stage/level of programmenumber and severity of previous offensesother information relevant to the caseacademic conventions within the relevant disciplinethe extent to which the misconduct, if undetected, would have resulted in an unfair advantage for the student or any other studentthe extent to which the misconduct, if undetected, would have had potential to compromise the integrity of the University's assessment processesthe impact of particular outcomes on a student's progression or graduationinformation and support provided to the student about academic integrity as part of their courseinformation about the student held in the Academic Misconduct Register.The student must be given the opportunity to be heard, before a final decision is made. The student should be given both the option to respond in person (with a support person present if desired) and to provide a written response.Following their investigation, the investigating party may: find that no academic misconduct has occurreddetermine an outcome commensurate with their powers and the level of offending as per Clause 8 of these proceduresfor allegations which have been investigated by the Head of Department and for which there is evidence of offending above Level One, refer the matter to the appropriate Pro-Vice-Chancellor for further considerationfor allegations which have been investigated by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor or a Pro-Vice-Chancellor and for which there is evidence of offending at Level Three, refer the matter to the Vice-Chancellor if exclusion of the student from the University is recommended. In all instances, the final outcome or referral should be reported to the Head, Student Experience (at academic.integrity@otago.ac.nz).The investigating party must keep a detailed record of their investigation.Where possible, investigations should be completed within a two-week timeframe.\n 8. Schedule of Outcomes where Academic Misconduct is Proven\nThe University shall take a primarily educative response to Level One misconduct. The Head of Department or Pro-Vice-Chancellor, or their nominees, shall take one or more of the following actions, including at least one educative action from options i to iv: issue the student with a warning that includes information about the University's Academic Integrity Policy and resources that are available to support the policyrequire the student to enrol in an academic integrity workshop or study skills workshop, or undertake personal consultancy with a Learning Adviser in Student Learning Development, within one month of receiving the letter advising them to do sorequire the student to undertake a supplementary, formative reflective assessment on academic integrityrequire the student to submit a new or revised version of the assessment affected by the academic misconduct, with the mark awarded for the resubmitted assessment not to exceed the student's original mark (including any adjustments made under 8(a)v)reduce the mark in the affected assessment so that the student gains no academic advantage from the misconduct; any such mark reduction should: not normally exceed 50% of the total available marks for the assessmenttake account of any reduction in marks (related to the misconduct) imposed through standard marking processes, andnot penalise the student beyond removing any advantage gained from the misconduct.In response to Level Two misconduct, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor or their nominee shall include at least one educative response from 8(a)ii \u2013 iii above and one of the penalties provided for under the Academic Statute, such as: submission of a new or revised version of the assessment with a maximum of a \u201cpass\u201d for the assessmenta zero mark for the assessment affected by the academic misconducta reduction in the overall mark for the paper affected by the academic misconducta fail grade for the paper in which the academic misconduct occurred, which may include withholding or withdrawing the granting of terms for the paper concernedthe cancellation of any pass or passes for any other part of the student's course undertaken in the same teaching period as the paper in which academic misconduct occurred, provided that any pass shall only be cancelled with the agreement of the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division in which the paper is taughtthe imposition of a non-academic penalty, consisting of a fine of up to $500 or community work of up 40 hours, provided that such a penalty will only be imposed where the student concerned could not have derived direct academic advantage from their misconduct.In response to misconduct in a doctoral degree, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) may include educational responses from 8(a) above and/or impose one of the penalties provided for under the Academic statute, such as: resubmission of the work affected by the complaint, either fully or in partdisqualification from continuing in the degree.In response to Level Three misconduct, including extremely serious misconduct in a doctoral degree, any appropriate penalties or responses provided for under the Academic Statute, including those listed under clauses 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c), may be imposed by the relevant authority or by the Vice-Chancellor. In addition, the Vice-Chancellor may direct that the student be excluded from the University permanently or for such period as the Vice-Chancellor may determine.The Head of the relevant Department shall be responsible for ensuring that any educational requirements as detailed under 8(a) are completed. Failure to satisfactorily complete such requirements shall be reported to the Head, Student Experience. This may entail: 'Result deferred' being reported for the relevant paper on the student's academic record and the paper being deemed incomplete until requirements have been met, orthe substitution of a penalty under clause 8(b) by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor or their nominee, if a student fails to complete a requirement within a reasonable timeframe and after at least two written warnings have been given. This may include a non-academic penalty as provided for under 8(b)vi.To ensure consistency in the application of the non-academic penalties provided for under clause 8(b)vi, the Pro-Vice-Chancellors shall maintain and apply a shared schedule of recommended outcomes for types of misconduct which may necessitate such penalties.The Proctor shall be responsible for ensuring that the requirements of any non-academic penalties imposed under clause 8(b)vi are met. Failure to meet such requirements shall be considered a breach of the Code of Student Conduct.\n9. Notification of Outcome\nUpon conclusion of the investigation, the investigating party shall advise the Head, Student Experience of the outcome.In cases of alleged misconduct in a doctoral degree, the Dean of the Graduate Research School will inform the candidate in writing of the outcome. The Head of Department, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) and, where relevant, Vice-Chancellor, will receive a copy of this letter.In all other cases, the Head, Student Experience will inform the student in writing of the outcome. The Head of Department, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and, where relevant, Proctor and/or Vice-Chancellor, will receive a copy of this letter. This communication will normally be sent within two working days of receiving notification of an outcome.Where an educational task or a penalty is imposed, notification of the student's right to request a review or appeal the decision, and the mechanism for a review or an appeal, shall be included in the letter to the student reporting the outcome of the investigation.\n10. Right of Appeal\nA student may appeal an academic misconduct decision made by: a Head of Department, to the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor, whose decision on the matter shall be finalthe Vice-Chancellor or Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) , or a Pro-Vice-Chancellor, to the Appeals Board of the University Council, in accordance with the provisions of the Appeals Statute.\n11. Reporting\nThe Head, Student Experience will provide oversight in relation to the completion of educative requirements as outlined under clauses 8(a) and 8(e).The Head, Student Experience shall ensure an accurate and up-to-date Academic Misconduct Register is maintained and that this information is kept confidential and accessed solely for investigating academic misconduct and providing reports on academic misconduct.The Head, Student Experience shall: ensure that all cases for the previous year are reviewed in January to check for trends, developments and repeat casesprovide a six-monthly update on academic misconduct to Pro-Vice-Chancellorsprovide an annual report on academic misconduct to Pro-Vice-Chancellors.The Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research and Enterprise) and Pro-Vice-Chancellors shall make reports to Senate and Council following the end of each academic year, containing a summary of all doctoral misconduct and Level Two and Three misconduct dealt with by them during that year. Such reports shall not include the names of individuals and shall as far as possible avoid reference to circumstances which might render any individual identifiable.AcknowledgementThese procedures are based on best practice principles developed by the Australian Office of Learning and Teaching (OLT)-commissioned Exemplary Academic Integrity Project (EAIP).

The International Centre for Academic Integrity definition of academic integrity has been adopted for these procedures."}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Travel_Planning_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Travel_Planning_Procedure.html", "scope": "These procedures apply to all staff, students and Council members of the University of Otago and all staff in controlled entities where they are travelling at the cost of the University of Otago or its controlled entities, and all other bookings made by the University of Otago.", "purpose": "The Senior Leadership Team ( SLT ) has agreed on a range of initiatives to further streamline the travel bookings process, beginning 14 June 2021. This Policy/Procedure should be read in conjunction with the memo issued by SLT. \nAs detailed in the Insurance Procedure, the University of Otago has subscribed to an international security and medical alert advisory service, Healix Travel Oracle.\u00a0\u00a0Travellers are strongly encouraged to install the Healix Travel Oracle App and select and read the Healix Travel information associated with the countries they are planning to travel to.Healix Travel Oracle App guide (PDF) - requires staff loginAll Domestic and International travel purchased through the MTA is loaded into the University's Travel Tracker programme (Healix) which allows the University and its insurers to know where staff or other University representatives are in the event of an emergency.", "content": "Please note that this document is currently under review.\n1.Travel Risk\nAs detailed in the Insurance Procedure, the University of Otago has subscribed to an international security and medical alert advisory service, Healix Travel Oracle.\u00a0\u00a0Travellers are strongly encouraged to install the Healix Travel Oracle App and select and read the Healix Travel information associated with the countries they are planning to travel to.Healix Travel Oracle App guide (PDF) - requires staff loginAll Domestic and International travel purchased through the MTA is loaded into the University's Travel Tracker programme (Healix) which allows the University and its insurers to know where staff or other University representatives are in the event of an emergency.\n2.Staff Travel Approvals\nBefore booking travel, staff should ensure that they have obtained the necessary approvals as required by their respective divisional travel approval process.\n3.Booking Air Travel\nThose approving air travel should ensure that travel is necessary given the impact air travel has on climate change, as well as the financial implications.Staff should ensure they book air travel via the most economical air travel class and route (in line with current policy requirements) in order to minimise the overall cost of travel to the University.All air travel should be booked through the MTA .All bookings made through a MTA must be made using a University Purchase Order for off-line bookings and include the appropriate GL/PL account code for on-line bookings.Travellers and travel bookers are encouraged to use the MTA online tools, where appropriate, to make their bookings to avoid any undue delay in the booking process.\n4.Land Travel\n4.1 Booking Land Travel\nLand Travel includes rental cars/taxis/trains/buses and ride sharing applications such as Uber.Land travel (including connections) may be booked as follows: Domestic via an MTA or be directly booked with the service provider subject to the conditions below.International via an MTA except as provided at section 6 below.\nNote: When using an MTA , bookings should be made at the same time as any associated flight bookings to avoid additional MTA fees.\n4.2Rental Cars\nRental car bookings (not being made in conjunction with Air Bookings) can be booked using the University's approved supplier(s) in the first instance, using either the supplier's web reservation system (with payment made via the travellers' PCard) or via the University's MTA (which can be charged back to the University via the MTA 's consolidated invoice). Rental car bookings required in conjunction with Air Travel bookings should be booked via the MTA at the same time as the respective flight bookings.To reduce cost and greenhouse gas emissions staff should select the lowest emissions option suitable for their journey. This should include consideration of Electric Vehicles ( EV s) where available. When considering EV s, the total cost of fuel/charging and rental should be used when comparing costs.No direct bookings (quoting a University Purchase order) for rental cars are to be made that would be directly invoiced back to the University.Where the approved supplier is unable to meet the booking requirement, the next most cost effective supplier should be used.When hiring a rental car, staff or other University representatives should not select the pre-paid fuel tank option as there is no credit applied for any un-used fuel remaining in the vehicle at the end of the hire period. To avoid a refuelling service charge, including higher fuel cost, staff or other University representatives should ensure the rental car fuel tank is full before returning it to the car rental company.If staff wish to use their private vehicle in lieu of a rental car, they should first familiarise themselves with section 7 of the Travel and Travel Related costs policy.\n4.3Taxis, Shuttles and Shared Ride Apps\nThe use of Taxi, shuttles and ride apps is permitted to be pre-booked or obtained as required directly with the service provider or via the MTA .Bookings for these services must be made noting the requirements in Section's 7 & 8 of the Travel and Travel Related costs policy.\n4.4Other\nFor all land travel, including road or rail, staff should use the best available pricing on the day.\n5.Booking Accommodation\nAccommodation can be booked (in order of preference): Using an MTA (as part of an overall travel booking for Domestic and International Travel). When arranging a booking, travellers are free to specify the required standard of accommodation to the MTA ;Directly with an accommodation provider, when: The booking is for domestic travel only;There is no associated air travel component to the itinerary;The booking can made using a recognised internet reservation system (eg trivago, booking.com) or directly with the accommodationThe payment for the accommodation will be via PCardAll 'Airbnb for work' bookings must be made through the MTA .\u00a0\u00a0A PCard cannot be used to pay for AirBnB as these bookings must be made via an MTA . To initiate an AirBnB for work booking: Go to https://www.airbnb.co.nz/workEnter your 'firstname.surname@otago.ac.nz' email address and follow the prompts to register with the University of Otago AirBnB AccountSearch for properties that are suitable for your needs based on the following minimum selection criteria: Type of Place: \u201cEntire Place\u201dAmenities: Has a \u201cSmoke Alarm\u201dUser rating of 4.5 or aboveEmail the link for the property to your University Travel Agent to book the property on your behalf and add it to your travel itineraryFor locations where AirBnB properties with the minimum criteria options are not available, AirBnB properties may only be used on the specific prior approval of the University Health and Safety Manager on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0\u00a0A copy of this approval will be required to be provided to the Travel agent to enable them to make the booking.\n6.Arranging Travel during period of RSL\nIt is recognised that where staff are on extended periods of RSL , it is often impractical to efficiently book incidental intra-continental travel via the MTA . Staff on RSL are free to book (and use their PCard for payment for) short-term/internal travel associated with their RSL provided: The staff member has downloaded the Oracle Travel App and has \u201cwatch-listed\u201d the countries they are intending to travel to.  To do this: Open the Travel Oracle AppClick into the 'Country Profile' sectionScroll to and 'select' the country you are intending to visitSelect 'Watch Country' box located at the bottom of the screenThe requirement for this ancillary travel was not identified/required at the time the initial RSL travel bookings were made with the University Travel Agent.\n7.Associated Private Travel\nWhere private travel is undertaken in conjunction with University business travel, or where family members or other non-business associates accompany staff members or University representatives on University business, the private part of the air travel and/or accommodation must be disclosed at the time the reservation is made and will be charged separately by the MTA . Private travel at discounted rates is not offered by all the airlines under the AoG agreement. Staff members or other University representatives should check with the MTA s prior to making a booking.Private travel or related costs are not to be charged to the University. This includes the charging of private travel costs to the University which is subsequently reimbursed by the staff member, or other University representatives. Any variation to this instruction requires the prior approval of the Chief Financial Officer.\n8.Insurance\nAll persons travelling internationally (including Australia and the Pacific Islands) on University business must have approved travel insurance.\u00a0\u00a0See the Insurance Procedure for more information.For vehicle rentals within New Zealand, staff or other University representatives are to decline the rental agency's insurance cover when hiring vehicles for Otago University business purposes.\u00a0\u00a0The University maintains insurance policies that provide coverage for the hire of rental vehicles used for University business purposes within New Zealand.Where a vehicle is hired outside New Zealand, staff or other University representatives must purchase comprehensive vehicle insurance from the rental agency. As not all hire contracts are structured the same, the staff member or other University representative must ask the rental agency to confirm that the insurance includes vehicle damage, third party, and public liability cover. Staff or University representatives should not pay an increased premium to secure an excess below NZ$6,000 (the University travel insurance policy will cover an excess up to this amount).Any questions regarding travel or vehicle insurance should be directed to Travel Insurance bookings, Divisional Services and Administration: Email travel.insurance@otago.ac.nz"}, {"policy type": "Procedures", "name": "Trust_Funds_and_T_Activities_Procedure", "url": "./output/html/Procedures/Trust_Funds_and_T_Activities_Procedure.html", "scope": "Organisational scope not found", "purpose": "These procedures set out the process for the distribution of Foundation Trust Funds held by the University of Otago Foundation Trust to the University of Otago. \nIntroductionThe University is the beneficiary of over 420 individual trust funds held by the Foundation Trust.

Minimum values for new prizes and scholarships are stated in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below. If perpetuity or minimum value requirements are not met, a special case will need to be made for the establishment of the prize or scholarship.The procedure for establishment of a new prize or scholarship is as follows: In considering establishment of a new prize or scholarship, the hosting department should first contact the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards or, if applicable, the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships for initial advice and assistance. If an external donor is involved, the Development and Alumni Relations Office and/or the Research and Enterprise Office must also be contacted.Where departmental funds are solely intended to support a new or amended prize, the Department must demonstrate the strategic value to the University of the prize before development of regulations. Strategic value in this instance is defined as supporting equity, sustainability or other key strategic frameworks of the University.The prize or scholarship regulations must be drafted to the satisfaction of the hosting department, the Manager Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards or Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships (whichever role is applicable) and the donor.The details for the prize or scholarship must be recorded on the appropriate proposal form, available from the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards.The completed proposal form must be signed by the appropriate Head of Department, Dean, or the equivalent head of the hosting department.For scholarships or prizes associated with an Academic Division, the proposal form and associated documentation must then be submitted for endorsement by the relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor or appropriate Divisional Board (approval practice may vary across Divisions).For University-wide scholarships or prizes, the proposal form must be endorsed by the appropriate Deputy Vice-Chancellor or the Vice-Chancellor.The completed documentation comprising a signed proposal form and final wording for the prize or scholarship regulations must be returned to the Manager Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, or the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships, if applicable, who will then arrange for final consideration and approval by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Proposals for new prizes or scholarships can be submitted at any time throughout the year.Naming of a new prize or scholarshipThe University allows prizes and scholarships to be named after sponsoring organisations and for the regulations of prizes and scholarships to acknowledge the donor, with the following provisos: The University does not accept sponsorship from companies that produce or distribute alcohol, tobacco or munitions.The University may require amendments to, or reject, a proposal for a new prize or scholarship, where the naming or acknowledgement of a sponsor is deemed to be against the values or strategic interests of the University.The University may require amendments to, or disestablish, an existing prize or scholarship, where the naming or acknowledgement of a sponsor is deemed to be against the values or strategic interests of the University.Prizes shall not be named after current members of staff or current students.Departments, Schools/Faculties and Divisions may choose to implement their own restrictions on prize naming and acknowledgement of donors within regulations, as is deemed appropriate to their discipline areas.Amendment of an existing prize or scholarshipAmendments to approved University Prizes or Scholarship regulations fall into three categories as follow:Minor editorial corrections such as formatting changes or minor wording changes that do not alter the substantive meaning of the regulations. These must be approved by the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, or for Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships by the Manager, Undergraduate Entrance Scholarships.Changes to the regulations which do not alter the general intent of the prize or scholarship. If applicable, these require consultation with the donor and/or the University's Treasury Accountant for trust-funded scholarships and prizes. Changes require the endorsement of the appropriate Head of Department (or equivalent) and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or equivalent) and final approval by the Convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council. Such changes may include amendments: to prize or scholarship titlesto information relating to the circumstances of the prize or scholarship (e.g. donor information)to selection criteria which do not alter the general intent of the prize or scholarshipto application processesto selection panelsto award valuesrelating to changes to papers, course structures or qualifications referred to in the regulations.Substantive changes to the regulations which alter the general intent of the prize or scholarship.

The process followed should be as detailed above under \u201cEstablishment of a New Prize or Scholarship\u201d.Disestablishment or suspension of an existing prize or scholarshipPrizes or Scholarships may be permanently disestablished or suspended due to lack of available funds or for strategic reasons.Where a prize or scholarship is funded by a trust, by an external donor, or by a department or other University unit, and temporarily there are insufficient funds to offer the award, the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards may suspend the prize or scholarship until such time as funding is again available or sufficient.Where a prize or scholarship is funded by a trust, by an external donor, or by a department or other University unit, and there are permanently insufficient funds to offer the award (either at its current value or under the guidelines laid out in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below),\u00a0the Scholarships and Prizes Committee may disestablish the prize or scholarship, through the delegated authority of Council.Requests for prizes or scholarships to be disestablished on strategic grounds should be made in writing to the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, and endorsed by the Head of the hosting department and relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or equivalent). This request shall be forwarded to the Scholarships and Prizes Committee who may disestablish the prize or scholarship, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Review of existing prizes and scholarshipsThe Scholarships and Prizes Committee shall conduct a formal review of the values of all University prizes and scholarships every four years. From this review the Committee shall:Approve increases of value in prizes and scholarships where funds permit.Approve the continuation of selected prizes and scholarships which fall below the usual minimum values outlined below, where there are strategic reasons for doing so, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Recommend to hosting departments the re-purposing of prizes and scholarships where an excess of available funds allow this (for example recommend a prize be amended to, or supplemented by, a higher-value scholarship where funding permits).Report to Senate and Council on currently suspended prizes or scholarships which have been suspended for more than one year.Approve the disestablishment of prizes and scholarships where there is insufficient continuing funding available, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Review minimum values as outlined in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below.Maintain a list of all University prizes and scholarships that is available on request to University staff and students.Prize and scholarship minimum valuesIt is expected that, notwithstanding section (f) below, all University prizes and scholarships will provide a monetary award, or an award in the form of other goods, to the recipient(s).The minimum monetary value for a new prize is normally $500.The minimum monetary value for a new scholarship is normally $3,000.The minimum monetary value for an existing prize or scholarship is normally half the minimum value for a new prize or scholarship (i.e. $250 and $1,500 respectively).Non-monetary goods awarded as prizes and scholarships (e.g. books) should have the approximate monetary values as specified above.Exceptions to minimum values for prizes and scholarships will only be approved in exceptional circumstances, and shall be considered by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council, either, for new prizes or scholarships, on the basis of a case provided by the hosting department, or for existing prizes or scholarships, following review (see Section 6 (b) above).Where, in any one year, a prize is shared across recipients, the value of the prize shall normally be split between the recipients. The amount awarded to each recipient must be no less than half the stated value of the prize. In cases where the prize is shared across more than twice the number of usual recipients, it is the responsibility of the host department to provide additional funds to meet this condition.Recording of prizes and scholarships on academic recordsThe recipient of a scholarship or prize approved by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council, will have the award notated on their academic transcript.", "content": "1.

The process followed should be as detailed above under \u201cEstablishment of a New Prize or Scholarship\u201d.Disestablishment or suspension of an existing prize or scholarshipPrizes or Scholarships may be permanently disestablished or suspended due to lack of available funds or for strategic reasons.Where a prize or scholarship is funded by a trust, by an external donor, or by a department or other University unit, and temporarily there are insufficient funds to offer the award, the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards may suspend the prize or scholarship until such time as funding is again available or sufficient.Where a prize or scholarship is funded by a trust, by an external donor, or by a department or other University unit, and there are permanently insufficient funds to offer the award (either at its current value or under the guidelines laid out in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below),\u00a0the Scholarships and Prizes Committee may disestablish the prize or scholarship, through the delegated authority of Council.Requests for prizes or scholarships to be disestablished on strategic grounds should be made in writing to the Manager, Postgraduate Scholarships, Prizes and Awards, and endorsed by the Head of the hosting department and relevant Pro-Vice-Chancellor (or equivalent). This request shall be forwarded to the Scholarships and Prizes Committee who may disestablish the prize or scholarship, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Review of existing prizes and scholarshipsThe Scholarships and Prizes Committee shall conduct a formal review of the values of all University prizes and scholarships every four years. From this review the Committee shall:Approve increases of value in prizes and scholarships where funds permit.Approve the continuation of selected prizes and scholarships which fall below the usual minimum values outlined below, where there are strategic reasons for doing so, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Recommend to hosting departments the re-purposing of prizes and scholarships where an excess of available funds allow this (for example recommend a prize be amended to, or supplemented by, a higher-value scholarship where funding permits).Report to Senate and Council on currently suspended prizes or scholarships which have been suspended for more than one year.Approve the disestablishment of prizes and scholarships where there is insufficient continuing funding available, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council.Review minimum values as outlined in \u201cPrize and Scholarship Minimum Values\u201d below.Maintain a list of all University prizes and scholarships that is available on request to University staff and students.Prize and scholarship minimum valuesIt is expected that, notwithstanding section (f) below, all University prizes and scholarships will provide a monetary award, or an award in the form of other goods, to the recipient(s).The minimum monetary value for a new prize is normally $500.The minimum monetary value for a new scholarship is normally $3,000.The minimum monetary value for an existing prize or scholarship is normally half the minimum value for a new prize or scholarship (i.e. $250 and $1,500 respectively).Non-monetary goods awarded as prizes and scholarships (e.g. books) should have the approximate monetary values as specified above.Exceptions to minimum values for prizes and scholarships will only be approved in exceptional circumstances, and shall be considered by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council, either, for new prizes or scholarships, on the basis of a case provided by the hosting department, or for existing prizes or scholarships, following review (see Section 6 (b) above).Where, in any one year, a prize is shared across recipients, the value of the prize shall normally be split between the recipients. The amount awarded to each recipient must be no less than half the stated value of the prize. In cases where the prize is shared across more than twice the number of usual recipients, it is the responsibility of the host department to provide additional funds to meet this condition.Recording of prizes and scholarships on academic recordsThe recipient of a scholarship or prize approved by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, through the delegated authority of Senate and Council, will have the award notated on their academic transcript."}], "Regulations": [{"policy type": "Regulations", "name": "Alcohol_Regulations_2014", "url": "./output/html/Regulations/Alcohol_Regulations_2014.html", "scope": "Organisational scope not found", "purpose": "Policy Purpose not found", "content": "Title, Approval and Commencement and RevocationThese regulations are the Alcohol Regulations 2014.These regulations were approved by the University Council at its meeting of 14 October 2014 pursuant to clause 7.3 of the Administration Statute 2011.These regulations apply, and the former Alcohol on Campus Statute 2011 is repealed and the Alcohol at Student Functions Regulations are revoked, with effect from 15 October 2014.DefinitionsAlcohol means any kind of liquor as defined in the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012.Campus means all land and buildings owned or occupied or for the time being controlled by the University of Otago anywhere in New Zealand.Dunedin Student Function means a Student Function held in Dunedin or arranged for Dunedin-based students, other than functions for residents of a University owned or affiliated college which takes place with the approval of the relevant Head of College.Student Function means any social function primarily for students and involving the use of alcohol which is held by a Division, Department, class or student group or student committee and any function held by the Otago University Students' Association (OUSA).Prohibited ActivitiesExcept as authorised by or under these Regulations, no person shall: bring alcohol into; orpossess alcohol in; orconsume alcohol in; ordisplay any material advertising alcohol (other than incidentally on personal clothing, bags or similar items) or conduct events or activities involving alcohol-related sponsorship in any part of the Campus.Except as authorised by or under these Regulations, no person shall: distribute communications; orconduct or endorse events or activities, involving alcohol-related advertising or sponsorship, in the name of, or in a way which implies the involvement of, the University.Alcohol at Student FunctionsDunedin Student Functions may be held only in accordance with an approval issued by the appropriate Head of Department, Head of College, Head of Service Division, Dean, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Deputy Vice-Chancellor or the Vice-Chancellor or, in the case of OUSA functions, the approval of the OUSA President or a delegate formally authorised by OUSA for the purpose.

Title, Approval and Commencement and Revocation\n1.1 These regulations are the Examinations and Assessment Regulations 2014.\n1.2 These regulations were approved by the Senate of the University at its meeting of 30 April 2014 pursuant to clause 4.1 of the Academic Statute 2011.\n1.3 These regulations apply, and the former Examinations Regulations are revoked, with effect from 1 May 2014.\n2. Internal Assessment and Terms Requirements\n2.1 The final grade for most papers (not including dissertations, theses, or other research exercises) incorporates the results for formal examinations conducted under the authority of the Senate at the end of the teaching period concerned (final examinations). Additionally, or alternatively, some or all of the final grade may be based on results for essays, assignments, laboratory or other practical work, and tests (sometimes known as terms tests) conducted by individual departments and schools (internal assessment).\n2.2 Some programmes and papers require that students gain terms (i.e. fulfil certain specified conditions such as completing oral, written or practical work) before they may sit final examinations. Terms are gained by completing established requirements such as attending classes or completing oral, written or practical work. Students must familiarise themselves with any terms requirements for any programmes or papers for which they are enrolled.\n3. Final Examination Only Enrolment\n3.1 A student, who has failed to pass a paper, subsequently may apply for Final Examination Only enrolment and the following shall apply:\nApplication for Final Examination Only enrolment must be made on the prescribed form, available from the University's website or AskOtago, to the Head of Department concerned by 10 January for summer school papers, 1 March for full year and first semester papers, and 31 July for second semester papers. A fee will be charged if an application is approved. Approval is at the discretion of the Head of Department and will only be given to students who have performed to a satisfactory standard.If the application is approved, the student is permitted to have internal assessment results and terms carried over in the paper and to sit the final examination again without attending any part of the course.This concession is not required to be available in all papers and, where available, may be granted only once in a particular paper.The examination must be attempted at the end of the semester or full year in which a paper is offered next, except that it may be attempted earlier if the paper concerned is offered in a summer school.A student who has been granted Final Examination Only enrolment in a paper may cancel the enrolment for that paper until 1 February for a summer school paper or 10 May for a first semester paper or 10 September for a second semester or full year paper. Later cancellations will be permitted only in exceptional circumstances.Final Examination Only candidates are not entitled to attend any lectures, laboratories, or tutorials, or receive assistance from academic staff, or have access to electronic holdings of course material, or receive printed course material.Final Examination Only enrolments are not taken into account in any consideration of a student's status as a full-time or part-time student.\n4. Examinations and Assessment\n4.1 Candidates are required to sit examinations at times and places which shall be determined by the Senate.\n4.2 The examinations shall be carried out in such manner as the Senate may prescribe. Candidates shall be subject to these regulations and to the Examination Rules and any other supplementary regulations prescribed and promulgated by the Senate from time to time.\n4.3 No candidate shall communicate with an examiner in regard to an examination either in the examination script or otherwise before the official release of confirmed final results, except through the Director, Student Experience.\n5. Special Consideration in Final Examinations\n5.1 At all University final examinations, other than Special Examinations, a student:\nwho has been prevented from taking any final examination through illness or other circumstances beyond his or her control; orwho considers that performance in any final examination has been seriously impaired by illness or other exceptional circumstances beyond his or her control at the time of, or in the 14-day period immediately prior to the examination,may apply for special consideration.\n5.2 Candidates seeking special consideration for all programmes in Dentistry, Medical Laboratory Science, Medicine, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy and Radiation Therapy, or in papers for Health Sciences postgraduate programmes other than papers with no clinical content which have been specifically excluded by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Health Sciences), should apply to the relevant Department, School or Faculty Office.\n5.3 Students in all other programmes or papers should apply to the Student Administration.\n5.4 The special consideration may consist of the following, except that the provisions in clauses (d) and (f) are not available for students enrolled in programmes identified in regulation 5.2:\na decision that no action is justified or appropriate; oradjusting an examination mark; orgranting a Special Examination in the paper concerned; orgranting an Aegrotat Pass in the paper concerned, where the examiners certify that the candidate's performance and competence in the paper were sufficiently above the minimum standard required to pass the paper (normally taken as a C+ standard or better); orgranting the choice of an adjusted examination mark or a Special Examination; orgranting the choice of an Aegrotat Pass or a Special Examination.\n5.5 Honours, distinction, or credit may not be awarded to a student who has received Aegrotat Passes in examinations for more than 30% of a programme, or for more than 30% of the final year's course in the case of a four-year degree programme.\n5.6 A claim for special consideration must be made within five calendar days of the last final examination for which special consideration is being sought and must be supported by a Health Declaration or other appropriate evidence.\n5.7 A student may not apply for special consideration after the date of the official release of confirmed final results.\n5.8 These regulations should be read in conjunction with any relevant examination regulations set out for individual programmes.\n6. Special Consideration for Internal Assessment\n6.1 Students may seek special consideration in internal assessment by applying to the relevant Head of Department, by whom, or under whose authority, appropriate special consideration may be granted.\n6.2 The extent of any special consideration allowed will reflect the weighting placed on the piece of work in question in determining the final overall result for the paper concerned. Where the assignment or internal assessment test counts significantly towards a final result, a formal Health Declaration will be required.\n7. Examinations Missed through Preventable Circumstances\n7.1 A student who is a finalist (i.e. enrolled for a course of study sufficient to complete a qualification in the semester or year concerned) or a postgraduate student, and who misses a final examination through genuine error, such as mistaking the time or date of the examination, may apply to sit a Special Examination.\n7.2 Application must be made in writing to the Director, Student Experience, no more than five calendar days after the missed examination.\n7.3 Each application must be accompanied by the prescribed fee.\n7.4 Applications shall be considered by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the Division in which the examination was held.\n7.5 Each applicant shall have no more than one application approved under this provision during their programme of study.\n8.

The multiplied figures are then summed and divided by the total number of points for all papers included in the calculation. GPAs are displayed to one decimal place on an academic record.\n10. Failure to Comply with Regulations\n10.1 Where a student has not complied with a University regulation in respect of a course or an examination (including a regulation relating to payment of course or examination fees), the Senate shall have power, having given the student reasonable opportunity of remedying the non-compliance:\nto decline to credit to the student's course any subject taken at the said examination; orto suspend, for such a time as it may think fit, the release to the student of the results of any examinations; orto withhold the recommendation by the Pro-Vice-Chancellor or Dean concerned for the conferring of the degree, or presentation of the diploma.\n11. Recounts\n11.1 Any candidate for a degree, diploma or other qualification may have the marks recounted in any paper or subject by making written application to the Director, Student Experience, within four weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n11.2 Each application must be accompanied by the prescribed fee.\n11.3 A recount of marks shall cover a careful re-check of the marks recorded by the examiner, and ensure that no answer or any portion of an answer, or work done during the teaching period which counts towards the final result, has been overlooked. Work is not re-marked.\n12. Retention of Scripts\n12.1 Examination scripts shall be retained by Departments for twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for that teaching period.\n12.2 Within the period of the start of week 7 to the end of week 12 following the official release of confirmed final results a student may, after completing an application form available from the University Information Centre, collect the original of that student's script from the Department concerned. In cases where an examination script is collected by a student no consideration will be given to any subsequent issue arising from the marking of that script, nor the addition or compilation of the marks. (Note: Some examination answers involving problem solving and multiple choice questions will not be returned to students, but may be seen within the Department concerned by arrangement.) After the end of week 12, Departments may dispose of all unclaimed examination scripts.\n12.3 Alternatively, a student may arrange through the Head of the appropriate Department to see that student's examination script for a particular examination in the presence of a member of the departmental staff within twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n12.4 A Distance Learning student who cannot reasonably visit the campus from which a paper is taught in order to view an examination script at the Department concerned may request a photocopy of the script by writing to the Director, Student Experience, within twelve weeks from the date of the official release of confirmed final results for the teaching period concerned.\n13. Variations\n13.1 In any case where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Vice-Chancellor that an alteration or amendment to a University regulation involving a change in a course of study, or in examination requirements, has caused hardship to a student, the Vice-Chancellor may make such provision as he or she shall think fit for the relief of such hardship.\n13.2 In exceptional cases, the Vice-Chancellor may approve variations to the application of these regulations to ensure fairness to a student or students.\n14.

Preamble\nThese regulations apply to the scholarships for Doctoral and Master\u2019s study listed in the attached Schedule. All regulations apply to each scholarship unless the Schedule specifies otherwise. There are separate regulations for certain scholarships in Health Sciences and some other scholarships for particular purposes.\n2. Purpose\nDoctoral scholarships are awarded by the University Council, on the recommendation of the Senate, to candidates proceeding to a course of supervised doctoral study at this University. These scholarships are normally available only to students seeking to obtain their first doctoral qualification. Candidates may be awarded one University of Otago doctoral scholarship only.\nMasters\u2019 scholarships are awarded by the University Council, on the recommendation of the Senate, to candidates in the first year of their thesis research for a Master\u2019s degree which constitutes entry to the PhD course at this University. These scholarships are available only to students seeking to obtain their first research-based Master\u2019s qualification.\n\n\n3. Academic Criteria and Eligibility\nDoctoral and Masters' scholarships will be awarded on the basis of:\nThe applicant's academic record:1In the case of an applicant for a doctoral scholarship who has completed a Master\u2019s degree by papers and thesis (at least 0.75 EFTS), the grades of all relevant2 advanced level papers counting towards the award of the degree and the thesis will be taken into account. An explanation of the time taken for completion of the thesis may be requested and considered by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee if the thesis has taken more than 2 EFTS (2 full- time years) to complete.In the case of an applicant for a scholarship without a Master\u2019s degree including a thesis, the grades of all relevant2 advanced level papers counting towards the award of the applicant\u2019s most relevant degree will be taken into account.In the case of applicants whose prior qualifications have been awarded by other universities, the University shall calculate a GPA score using what it considers to be the most relevant2 papers and grades provided on the applicant\u2019s academic transcripts.Certificate of Proficiency and Pass/Fail papers will not be taken into account in the calculation.The applicant's potential for, or record of, research.The advice, recommendation and/or ranking of the relevant Head of Department.The strategic research and business priorities of the Academic Division in which primary supervision of the applicant's research will take place.Eligibility for doctoral and Masters' scholarships:Unless otherwise stated in these conditions or within the schedule, Doctoral and Masters\u2019 scholarships are open only to Domestic Fee Paying Students.3 International candidates studying for professional doctorates are eligible to apply but if awarded a scholarship the tuition fee waiver will be capped at the domestic rate.In the case of applicants for a doctoral scholarship, confirmation of the scholarship is dependent on approval of their application for admission to the relevant doctoral programme and completion of the enrolment procedure.In the case of applicants for a Master's scholarship, confirmation of the scholarship is dependent on approval of their application to register as a Master's candidate and completion of the enrolment procedure.\n\n\n4. Tenure\nA doctoral or Master\u2019s scholarship may be awarded with full-time or part-time tenure. Part- time tenure will only be granted in cases where full-time study is not practicably possible and where the candidate can demonstrate that they are particularly well prepared for part-time study. Applications to transfer from part-time to full-time tenure will be considered, provided that the candidate has shown satisfactory progress and can provide evidence of the ability to commit to full-time study. Applications to transfer from full-time to part-time tenure will be considered only on grounds of ill health (a medical certificate will be required), significant carer responsibilities (for example: pre-school aged child; school aged child as a sole parent with limited support; or child/partner/parent with a serious illness or disability) or for career related reasons. Part-time tenure for career related reasons is subject to approval by supervisors. Transfers of this sort may only occur at the beginning of a semester. Emoluments for candidates holding part-time tenure will be pro-rated as appropriate.During tenure of the scholarship the candidate must undertake research in Dunedin or at the University of Otago, Christchurch or University of Otago, Wellington, unless a special case for exemption from this requirement has been previously approved by the convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee.Tenure of a doctoral scholarship is for three full-time years (or part-time equivalent), or until the thesis is submitted (whichever period is the shorter), subject to the provision of satisfactory annual Progress Reports by the Department in which the student is registered. For candidates in professional doctorates, tenure may also cover periods of coursework prior to and after the thesis enrolment period, but will not exceed three years.Tenure of a Master's scholarship is for one full-time year (or part-time equivalent), or until the thesis is submitted (whichever period is the shorter.) Students must be in the first year of their thesis research to be eligible for a scholarship.A shorter period of tenure shall be awarded in cases where two months or more of registration as a candidate for the degree (or for the part of the degree eligible for scholarship support) has been completed at the time of award.Overseas tenure of a Master's scholarship is not normally permitted.Overseas tenure of a doctoral scholarship is not normally permitted.\u00a0On delegation from the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, the convenor of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee, may agree to: a period of normally up to one year\u2019s overseas tenure for a period following domestic (New Zealand-based) commencement if it can be shown by the Head of Department concerned, that access to facilities or opportunities overseas is essential to the completion of the project. In such circumstances the emolument of the scholarship shall continue to be paid in New Zealand currency and into a New Zealand bank account. No additional financial assistance is available through the Scholarship for travel or other expenses incurred if a period of overseas tenure is approved.partial tenure for commencement overseas, where the student is unable to travel to New Zealand to begin their study, but remote research and supervision arrangements have been approved. The terms of partial overseas tenure are set out in section 5 below of these regulations.\n\n\n5. Emolument\nDoctoral and research Masters' scholarships consist of the following components for the tenure of the scholarship, unless the attached Schedule specifies otherwise:\nA tuition fee waiver for the degree for which the scholarship is given.4 (Note: Applicants should be aware that a University of Otago scholarship does not waive fees for any papers that may be taken in addition to the full-time thesis course for which the scholarship is given unless approved by the Scholarships and Prizes Committee.)Should a student by way of government policy become subject to international tuition fees during scholarship tenure, the student will be responsible to pay the tuition fee costs over and above the tuition fee waiver at the domestic rate.For students studying on campus in New Zealand, or with approved distance study in New Zealand, a living allowance paid in equal monthly instalments for the tenure period of the Scholarship.5International doctoral students approved partial tenure for commencement overseas (under Regulation 4(g)ii) shall only be eligible for a monthly living allowance upon the conclusion of remote study and their arrival on campus in New Zealand. Living allowance entitlement will be calculated by deducting time already spent on research since commencement overseas from 36 months full-time study or 72 months part-time study, whichever is applicable. No backdating of living allowance to the time of remote commencement will occur.\n\n\n6. Additional Income\nA doctoral or research Master's scholarship may not be held concurrently with any other scholarship/s worth more than half the annual emolument of a University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship, in the case of doctoral study, or a University of Otago Research Master's Scholarship, in the case of Master's study. Research Grants, Travel Grants, and any Grants specifically designated to cover research costs, for which the candidate must present receipts, are not considered to be scholarships in this instance.Full-time scholarship recipients may not accept paid employment for more than 500 hours across a period of twelve months, without prior permission from the Scholarships and Prizes Committee (for part-time scholarship recipients, the maximum employment hours are 1000 hours across a period of twelve months). Otherwise, there is no specific limit on any other form of additional income, provided that the student\u2019s progress on his or her studies is maintained at a satisfactory level.University of Otago employees who are pursuing their Master's or doctorate as part of their employment are ineligible for University of Otago scholarship funding.\n\n\n7. Applications\nApplications for scholarships are made online through the University\u2019s website. An invitation to apply for scholarships is sent once an application for admission to the relevant qualification is complete. Applications may be made at any time and should normally accompany the application for admission to the relevant qualification. Where an applicant is completing a Master\u2019s degree which includes enrolment in papers prior to enrolment in a thesis, application should normally be made following completion of those papers. An invitation will be sent when enrolment in the thesis component of the Master\u2019s degree is completed.\n\n\n8. Academic Qualifications\nStudents whose degree has been conferred at any university other than a New Zealand or Australian University should check the requirements for credential evaluation, available here.\nApplicants whose qualifications are from countries in the list available on the website must provide an original or certified copy of the transcript from their university.Qualifications from all other countries must be referred to: Education Credential Evaluators, Inc.6\nThe applicant is required to pay for the evaluation, with the applicant and the University of Otago each receiving a copy of the resulting evaluation report.\n\n\n9. Acceptance and Deferment\nAn offer of a doctoral or research Master\u2019s scholarship must be accepted or declined within the time frame specified in the offer. There is provision for the acceptance to be subject to the eventual outcome of any application that the candidate may have also made for external scholarships.\nFollowing acceptance of the offer of a scholarship, the candidate must be enrolled for the degree concerned no later than the date specified in the letter of offer.\nTenure of a scholarship may be deferred only in exceptional circumstances. A candidate whose application for deferment is declined may apply again for a scholarship in a later year.\nIf the candidate defers (i.e. has a temporary suspension) during study, the scholarship payments will cease until the candidate re-enrols. In cases of a retrospective deferral, the candidate will be given the option of either repaying the scholarship for the months deferred, or, upon re-enrolment, waiting the requisite number of months until payments continue.\n\n\n10. Cancellation\nUpon the termination of a Student\u2019s enrolment for any reason, or his or her withdrawal, any entitlement to ongoing scholarship funding shall cease. In such circumstances, the University may also require repayment (in part or full) of any scholarship payments already made. However, no repayment will be required of any amounts paid for a period in respect of which a student can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Convener of the Scholarships and Prizes Committee, or their nominee, the devotion of reasonable efforts towards the requirements of his or her degree.\nThe University of Otago may, at any time, suspend or terminate the scholarship, or require the forfeiture of such proportion of the scholarship as the University of Otago may determine, if it is not satisfied that the recipient is not appropriately enrolled, diligently pursuing their programme or if the recipient has brought the University of Otago, the scholarship or donors into disrepute.\n\n\n11.
